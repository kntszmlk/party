BULGARIA FOR ALL ELECTION PLATFORM 1994 OF THE MOVEMENT OF RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES / MRL / --------------------------------------------------------- FOR STABILITY AND FREE INITIATIVE PRAGMATISM AND PERSONAL EMGAGEMENT Four years have gone by since the beginning of the economic and political changes in Bulgaria. The expections for a quick and painless transition to a market economy and democratic social organization have not come true. MRL presents its election platform driven by its desire to assume its share of responsibility for the successful implementation of the reform. The continued social and economic destabilization of society requires a new philosophy of the reform, one which only a pragmatic internal and foreign policy can provide. It is only under these conditions that we can assume a dignified place in European and global structures. MRL is a political guarantor of the maintanance of social peace and internal stability in the country during the difficult and painful transition to a civil society and market economy. Finding a peaceful, balanced and stable solution of the economic crisis is the only guarantee for the future of Bulgaria. MRL offers such a solution to the concrete economic, political and social problems which Bulgaria faces at present. THE PRIORITY AIMS OF MRL ARE : SOCIAL PEACE NATIONAL SECURITY AND INTERNAL STABILITY GUARANTEES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MINORITY RIGHTS GUARANTEES OF THE LIFE AND PROPERTY OF CITIZENS STABILIZATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SOCIAL PROTECTION OF EVERY CITIZEN The transition to democracy and free civil society in the country will be successful only with the complete observation of individual and collective rights of man and human communities. Ever since its creation the MRL has maintained that the guaranties of national sovereignty and national security by definition require the provision of real protection, political and legislative guarantee of basic rights and liberties of man and of the ethnic minorities in the country. Driven by the national interests / i.e. sovereignty and security / we tied this problem to the STABILIZING ROLE OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES in the democratizing countries from the viewpoint of their physical and ethno-cultural survival. MRL IS FOR POLITICAL REALISM WHICH DEFINES ITS STRATEGY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HISTORICAL REALITIES AND ACTUAL POLITICAL REALITIES ON THE BALKANS. We oppose political extremism. In Bulgaria there can hardly exist extreme leftist and extreme rightist political programmes from the viewpoint of historical realities and contemporary social structure. An extreme leftist policy will be an anacronism and a relic of the past while an extreme rightist policy will widen to a maximum the gap between the very poor and the very rich and will turn the country into a banana republic. FROM THIS VIEWPOINT THE NATURAL PLACE OF THE MRL IS IN THE POLITICAL CENTRE. Centrism will establish and realize itself in our political life as it will offer original alternatives for the implementation and completion of the reform in the country. FOR THE MRL DEMOCRACY IS ORDER BASED ON LEGALITY. THE MRL has chosen its path - the path of forsighted political dialogue, of forsighted legislative guarantees of national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. THE MRL HAS PUT IN PRACTICE THE BULGARIAN MODEL OF SOLUTION OF ETHNIC PROBLEMS. This model has already acquired popularity in the world and has strenghtened the position of the MRL as a political subject of the democratic process while creating a precedent in the history of the XX century. The MRL will do all that is necessary for the PRESERVATION AND STABILIZATION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY. The active presence of THE MOVEMENT in the political life of the country has changed in a fundamental way politics on the Balkans while creating in Bulgaria conditions and premises for peaceful resolution of the ethnic problems. Peace on the Balkans is the main condition for integration of the country in the European and global structures. We will actively contribute to the implementation of a balanced foreign policy which defends national interests. THE STRENGHTENING OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC STATE is an important condition for the speeding of the reform process in the country. The active role and participation of the MRL in the central state institutions is a guarantee of the radical implementation of political reform. THE MRL IS A POLITICAL AND PARLIAMENTARIAN GUARANTOR of the preservation and continuation of social peace and internal stability in the country during the difficult transition to a civil society and market economy. RISING CRIME AND CORRUPTION MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL AND DONE AWAY WITH. The MRL will require strict observance of the law from the institutions of the law and order system, from the courts and the prosecution and from the organs of financial control. We are for the provision of guarantees of complete protection of the LIFE AND PROPERTY of every household and family, of every man. OUR AIM IS A FREE CIVIL SOCIETY OF ORDER, LEGALITY AND SECURITY OF THE POPULATION. PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF MAN AND OF HUMAN COMMUNITIES The political and legislative provision of guarantees of the rights and liberties of man and of minorities in the Republic of Bulgaria is an important priority in the activities of the MRL. We are an open political organization which defends the rights and liberties of all Bulgarian citizens regardless of their ethnic and religious affiliation. The MRL whole-heartedly supports the European convention for the protection of basic rights and liberties, of which Bulgarian is a signatory and which is ratified by our country. The central principle for us is that of FREE CHOICE OF IDENTIFICATION - national, ethnic, lingual, cultural and religious. The MRL views THE ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY OF OUR COUNTRY AS A PREMISE OF THE WEALTH OF ITS CUKTURE. We are for the creation of favourable conditions for the development of national Bulgarian culture but also for the development of the cultures, traditions and customs of all ethnic, lingual and religious minorities. It is beyond doubt that we have gained numerous victories in the restoration of basic rights and liberties of man and of the ethnic minorities in the country such as : - the right of free choice of name; - the right of learning the mother tongue; - access to mass media; - freedom of religion; - direct participation in the legislature and in the executive. These successes must not put us at rest. We realize that the restoration of the fundamental rights and liberties of man and of ethnic minorities is a long and complex process. The MRL will initiate the legislative regulation and recognition of the rights and liberties of man and of human communities in Bulgaria. STABILIZATION AND ECONOMIC ADVANCE The centrist position of the MRL defines our strategy for the implementation of economic reform from the viewpoint of the interests and orientation of our electorate : STABILIZATION OF THE REAL ECONOMY ECONOMIC ADVANCE FREE ECONOMIC INITIATIVE The successful realization of the MARKET REFORMS IS A FUNCTION OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MODEL OF STABILITY. The advantages of economic development and stability of social relations come together in this model. The implementation of the social and economic changes and the acceleration of the pace of reform define the following priorities of the MRL : A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR STABILIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS BASED ON CLEAR ECONOMIC PRIORITIES. We call for a structural reform which takes into account the development of strategically important sectors of the economy and of particular productions which have high potential, proven qualities and shares of the international markets, capabilities to compete and long tradition. THE ACCELERATION OF THE PACE OF AGRICULTURAL REFORM is a central priority for the MRL. The main principles of our agrarian policy are : - accelerated restitution of land in real boundaries; - provision of land for people with no or little land; - preferences in the purchase of new pieces of land for those landless people employed actively in villages. The MRL is for protection and assistance to highly productive agriculture through creation of economic, financial and other premises : - Law of protection and development of agriculture; - systems of credit preferences; - minimum buying prices which guarantee profitable production. We are for the preservation of the position of local agricultural products on the home market while at the same time enhancing the qualities of our products in order for them to compete on unternational markets. The MRL is for the creation of modern and effective production structures in agriculture which work in market conditions. Their operation requires the development and application of profit-yielding projects for modernization of agriculture. We are for the establishment of a National Fund of Agriculture which will provide preferencial financial assistance to the best projects. PROTECTION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTION - a traditional culture and main occupation of a big part of the population in the country. The Law of Tobacco and Tobacco Products is already a fact due to the incredible efforts made by the Parliamentary group of the MRL. The resolution of the problems in the production of tobacco require : - provision of state guarantees for the buying of tobacco; - guaranteeing of minimum buying prices; - creation of a Fund of " Tobacco " which supports and stabilizes the production of tobacco; - stabilization and widening of the markets of tobacco and tobacco products; - creation of joint enterprises for the production of cigarettes. The MRL is for A NEW REGIONAL POLICY which is rooted in cultural and historical traditions, in the values of the people and in their readiness in participate in certain economic activities. It is necessary to develop concrete PROGRAMMES FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT which will allow us to overcome the current disproportions among the various regions. The MRL is for the introduction of limited budget subsidies which stimulate economic activities in the endangered regions and provide long-term gainful employment for the population. We insist on the passage of a Law of Development of Mountaneous and Semi-mountaneous Regions in the country which guarantees normal life conditions and economic development. THE PROTECTION OF HOME PRODUCTION - a basis for stabilization and economic advance in Bulgaria. The MRL is for balanced protectionism of Bulgarian producers and for an increase of the supply of goods and services. This is the road to job creation and to provision of gainful employment. The main emphasis in this regard is on : - passage of a Law of Protection of Home Production; - introduction of new technologies and innovations which ensure competitiveness and efficiency of Bulgarian goods; - encouragement of the development of extraction oflocal raw materials and of the processing industries and services. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF STATE PROPERTY. The main parameters of our economy are defined by the state sector in the economy. The financial stabilization of state enterprises requires : - immediate end to the decapitalization of the state sector; - profitable work of state companies and bringing them in line with market requirements; - restructuring of losing productions which are of national importance and gradual decrease of the subsidies for them; - objectivity ans transparence of managerial competitions; - immediate decisions on the future of companies, including those up for privatization; - tightening of financial discipline and tax control of companies. PROTECTION OF BULGARIAN EXPORTERS. The increase of production and export of Bulgarian goods is a guarantee for economic advance in the country. The MRL offers a new policy aimed at the Bulgarian exporter : - balanced protectionism of state and private producers of export goods; - protection from unfair import - which includes the raising of import taxes and tariffs; - application of a scheme of short-term credit provision for exporters at eased interest conditions. ACCELERATION OF PRIVATIZATION through the application of pragmatic methods and schemes which include market privatization and mass privatization. The MRL offers : - short-term plan for the transformation of municipal property; - creation of conditions for active participation of national capital potential in the process of market privatization; - establishment of legislative framework and complete transparence of information in the sphere of mass privatization; - wide campaign for the clarification of all conditions and rights of citizens in the process of mass privatization. The MRL is for AN ECONOMY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. We cannot support the distribution of our national wealth among a small group of rich people. It is our aim that EVERY BULGARIAN CITIZEN who has created national capital can participate in its distribution. The MRL is for the attraction of FOREIGN INVESTMENT in the process of privatization. In order to provoke interest for direct investment in the country we need : - to offer attractive companies for privatization in tourism, communications, transport, etc. - to reduce bureaucratic obstacles to the registration and participation of foreign investors in this process; - legislative guarantees and tax preferences for foreign investments; - creation of effective procedures of the swaps of foreign debt for company property. FINANCIAL STABILIZATION AND CONTROL. Stagnation in the economy has not been overcome after four years of structural reforms. The money - credit and financial systems of the country are unstable. The decision of the state to assume most uncollectible credits has led to a disbalanced condition of the commercial banks. The application of immediate, radical measures for stabilization of the financial sector require : - creation of a legislative and administrative mechanism for the implementation of banking reform; - bringing under control the budget deficit and strict financial control which increases tax collection; - financial stabilization of commercial banks and strengthened and effective bank supervision; - strict control of the process of giving credits and of the choice of projects in which to invest the financial resources of the banks; - regulation of the terms of internal convertability of the lev and control over the export of currency; - strict rules and control in the licensing of new banks and provision of evidence of the origin of own money; - passage of a Law of Stock Exchanges and Stocks; - inclusion of the banking sector in the process of privatization. PROTECTION OF PRIVATE BUSINESS. The MRL is for the implementation of an active state policy in support of private business and entrepreneurship. THE FREE PPIVATE ECONOMIC INITIATIVE is the basis for the creation and development of a middle class in Bulgaria. We support the provision of clear and precise rules and laws for private business which include : - a Law of Private Business which stimulates the opening of small and middle private companies which in turn provide new jobs; - tax exemptions for private business in manufacturing for a three-year period; - preferential access to credits for private entrepreneurs which would allow accumulation of start-up capital; - tariff-free import of new technologies and manufacturing machinery; - creation of regional consulting units which provide information and assistance to entrepreneurs and others. ACTIVE FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLIVY. The road to the global and European economic structures requires a restoration of the authority of Bulgaria as a producer and trading partner. The MRL offers : - further development of foreign economic and trading relations of the country; - restoration of the old, traditional markets of Bulgarian goods in the countries of the Union of Independent States and in Central Europe; - development of the economic and trading partnership with the Balkan countries and further improvement of co-operation within the Black Sea Economic Zone; - active participation in international investment projects of mutual interest in the fields of ecology, transport, infrastructure, etc.; - long-term strategy for gaining access to and establishing a presence in new markets. DIGNIFIED LABOUR AND SOCIAL PROTECTION The successful implementation of the economic reforms is impossible without an adequate social policy. Our aim is A MARKET ECONOMY TURNED TOWARD MAN. We are for a SOCIAL POLICY in protection of the economic and social status of all social groups in society which guarantees the dignity of man and his right to labour, health care and education. EVERY CITIZEN HAS THE RIGHT OF LABOUR AND DIGNIFIED REWARD. The PROTECTION OF THE REAL INCOMES OF THE POPULATION is an important emphasis of the social policy of the MRL. We offer : - implementation of co-ordinated / among the social partners / policy in the sphere of income which guarantees the real incomes of the population; - implementation of an effective price policy and tightening of control over the " watched " prices of goods of " first necessity "; - provision of guarantees of the minimal working wage and the related social security payments, unemployment compensations, social pensions for the handicapped, etc. - placement of limits on the speculative increase of prices and tough sanctions for all profiteers; - improvement of the mechanism of automatic adjustment of pensions and other social payments to the rate of inflation and raising cost of living. Bringing down inflation is a key to economic advance. Only in this way can we protect the savings and incomes of the population. NEW JOBS. Unemployment can and must be brought under control. THE OPENING OF NEW JOBS IS A MAIN PRIORITY IN THE SOCIAL POLICY of the MRL. We offer : - development of regional programmes of employment for regions and municipalities which have reached a critical level of unemployment; - creation of a special fund for regional development to be financed by the state, municipal budgets and international organizations; - tax preferences for private and state firms investing in manufacturing which creates new jobs; - development of programmes for alternative employment and retraining for employees in companies due for closure. The esrablishment of an EFFECTIVE SOCIAL SECURITY NETWORK which encompasses all sociall weak strata of the population. The MRL is for targeted compemsation of income for socially weak strata of the population. We will insist on the just distribution of the resources for social programmes. The distribution of financial means for the municipal budgets must take into account the specific conditions and existence minimum level of the various regions and municipalities of the country. The MRL will support the creation of STOCKHOLDERS' FUNDS OF PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE. Only in this way can we ensure a dignified existence for the elderly. We will insist on the passage of a new Law of Retirement which also deals with the question of a new categorization of labour. THE PROTECTION OF THE FAMILY AND CARE FOR THE CHILDREN are a responsibility of every democratic society. We will insist on reviewing and increasing family monthly allowances during child-rearing in line with inflation and rising living costs. The MRL is for ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. The financing of health care must be done through a new shareholders' system of health insurance. We are for improvement of the mechanism of provision of free or low-cost medicine which takes into consideration the health condition, age, degree of disability and social situation of the citizens. The policy of the MRL in the field of EDUCATION AND CULTURE is aimed at the provision of guarantees of the right of the ethnic and cultural-religious communities to develop their spiritual capabilities and values. As a unique organization we consider cultural pluralism as one of the norms of a free civil society. The MRL is for THOUGHTFUL AND PRAGMATIC REFORM OF THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. We offer : - that the state assumes an active interest in education and culture; - preservation of free secondary education and state quotas in universities; - achievement of higher standards in the process of learning and legal recognition of dimplomas from Bulgarian schools and universities in Europe and in the whole world; - creation of a system which stimulates the participation of private business in the establishment of an educational network and improvement of conditions in municipal schools. The MRL is for the PROVISION OF GUARANTEES FOR THE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION and the other massmedia. We are for equal access to the mass media. Their main criterion is objectivity of information which should be sought at all times. The MRL is for AN INDEPEMDENT FOREIGN POLICY OF SOVEREIGN BULGARIA. The MRL will continue to support a balanced foreign policy based on the main principles of international law laid down in statute book of the United Nations / Articles 1 and 2 / and in the Final Document of the Conference of Co-operation and Security in Europe from August, 1st, 1975. Among these principles are : equality in international relations, reciprocity and pragmatism, continuity and openness, non-application of force or threat by force as well as the main principles for the protection of the nations, peoples and man : equal rights, right of self-determination, protection of human rights and liberties. The MRL has contributed to THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE POSITIVE IMAGE OF BULGARIA as a serious and stable partner in international relations which defends the national interests and foreigh policy objectives of Bulgaria in all important geo-political areas. The MRL supports the policy of COMPLETE RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, for the strengtening of her statehood and independence. We call for a cease-fire in Bosna and Herzegovina, for finding a just and stable solution to the conflict which preserves the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosna and Herzegovina. The MRL is for non-participation in military activities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATIC CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE and the breakdown of bloc divisions over the last years provoke a complete re-evaluation of the role and functions of NATO and the Western European Union as european, euroatlantic, political and defense structures. The MRL WELCOMES THE OFFER OF THE USA FOR PARTICIPATION IN " PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE " which will lead to greater co-operation among the states in the process of handling of crises, maintanance of peace and conduct of life-saving operations. The contribution of the MRL for the admission of the country as an equal member of the Conference of Co-operation and Security in Europe and the Council of Europe is beyong question. Bulgaria was able to make the transition from a totalitarian society to a democratic society with a market oriented economy without serious social shake-ups and without ethnic conflicts. The creation of the MRL, its participation in the Great Peoples' Assembly after the first multiparty free democratic elections in 1990 has enhanced the authority of Bulgaria and has been one of the most serious guarantees for the admission of the country in a number of European political, economic and military structures. There began talk of a " Bulgarian model " in the resolution of the immensely thorny problem of provision of guarantees and protection of the rights of the minorities. The MRL has contributed to the strengthening of the authority of Bulgaria in the biggest European political organization - the PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. The MRL is for PROVISION OF GUARANTEES AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF BULGARIANS who live in some neighbouring countries - the western regions of Serbia, Greece, etc. - a position which the MRL has defended in the Council of Europe and at other international forums. THE ELECTION PROGRAMME OF THE MRL IS DRAFTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REAL CAPABILITIES OF THE COUNTRY. BULGARIAN FOR ALL ! STABILITY AND FREE INITIATIVE WILL ENSURE ECONOMIC ADVANCE IN BULGARIA AND DIGNIFIED LIFE FOR ITS CITIZENS. THE MRL IS FOR PRAGMATISM IN POLITICS AND PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT OF EVERY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF HIS CONSTITUENTS. SOFIA, 1994
