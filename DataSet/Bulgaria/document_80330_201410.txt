Option for public consultation
ELECTION COMMITMENTS OF THE ABV
(parliamentary elections 2014)
Dear compatriots, After a quarter of a century of transition, Bulgaria needs not just a change of government, but a real and radical change in politics.
Bulgarian politics in recent years has lost its public goals, lost direction and criteria for success and failure.
The Bulgarian citizens have no security and self-confidence that their lives are changing in a positive direction.
Bulgarian society increasingly feels an acute lack of justice.
ABV is fighting for a change of policy that will lead to self-confidence and mobilisation in Bulgarian society.
To the setting of clear goals and solidarity in efforts to achieve them.
To preserve national identity and interest in the framework of deepening integration in Europe.
To trust and support for Bulgarian institutions.
To more statehood and a real increase in the quality of life for every Bulgarian citizen.
Ð†. Main objectives and priorities
The ABV Coalition proposes three main goals for Bulgarian politics to start working on immediately after the elections. Restoration of Bulgarian statehood - deep reform of the state structure, institutions and the judiciary
Second. A radical change of the political model - a change of the electoral system and the role of parties.
Third. Prevention of demographic collapse and revival of the nation - economic, social, educational, cultural and spiritual revival.
II. Strengthening the statehood. Establishment of a presidential republic
ABV stands for a deep constitutional change of the structure of the Bulgarian state.
Our current democratic institutions operate formally and inefficiently.
They are increasingly moving away from the sovereign and do not meet the expectations of the Bulgarian citizens.
Instead of an institution for debate and shaping national priorities, the National Assembly has been turned into a body that only validates decisions taken by the prime minister or by unknown behind-the-scenes players behind closed doors.
Behind its institutional independence, the judiciary hides unaccountability, external influences, inefficiency and behind-the-scenes, even criminal arrangements.
Local government is disempowered, overwhelmed by bureaucracy and often unable to address the basic needs of citizens.
The administration is cumbersome and inefficient, subject to partisan influences and highly susceptible to corrupt pressures.
