WE ARE TO THIS ELECTION
We are necessary for our country to regain its national sovereignty
and to create a society that offers justice, dignity and equal opportunities to all.
We stand for the good because we believe in the unity of the Greeks in a comprehensive national effort, far from the pseudo-dilemmas of yesterday.
I HAVE TO GET THEM ALL OUT.
Here and now the whole truth about how we have been put under the memoranda of poverty and misery and the shackles of recycling loans on usurious terms.
All the secret and secret documents should be made public and those responsible should be put in the dock as the People and History demand and deserve.
THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND REWARDING NATURE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND REWARDING RECOMMENDATION IS THE REAL GOOD
Citizens should be taxed according to their objective capabilities
and taxes should be returned back to society through projects, benefits and a high level of Public Education, Health and Safety.
The engine of the private economy and investment will take off with a stable tax system and friendly tax rates, at the levels of our neighbouring countries.
OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH IS A NECESSARY GOOD
Our national resources must be used on the basis of our own National Plan in cooperation with the strategic partners that we ourselves will choose, and
not be part of the national sell-out that has been attempted in recent years.
Greece belongs to the Greeks and so do our national resources.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A NECESSARY GOOD
Greece is a country with borders, external and internal security, specific economic, social and demographic resilience and not just a place of free entry and exit for an uncontrolled number of illegal immigrants.
Impose a migration policy under full state control, with strict quotas and sanctions, while campaigning for a revision of the Dublin II treaty.
NECESSITY OF BURDENSOME PROJECTS IN TURKEY'S DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG
Our Muslim Greek fellow citizens have all the rights and obligations provided by the Constitution and our laws and have no need for protection or support from foreign consulates.
Thrace is a national cause.
MACEDONIA IS ONE IT IS GREEK AND NON-NEGOTIABLE AND THAT IS A REAL GOOD
No agreement is accepted that will include the name Macedonia, in any sense and for any use.
Because anything else is an undermining of our History, Culture and Tradition.
Anything else is a vehicle for the irredentism and aggression of our northern neighbours, in a region that is sensitive to geopolitical and population upheavals.
THE ADHGHIAIAO AND THE ETOPI CHILIPRIASCCIUS
There is a regime of foreign invasion and occupation in the Megalonissos, against the resolutions and decisions of the UN.
Our Cypriot brothers are called to talk under the threats of invaders and conquerors.
The withdrawal of Turkish troops and the renunciation of the Pseudo-state are the only correct conditions for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, with benefits for both Communities.
FOREIGN POLICY IS A NECESSARY GOOD
Our Homeland is the geopolitical - geostrategic gateway between the West and the East and it is a national betrayal for some to want it in the role of an observer, or even worse, a bystander.
It is not the economy that should influence our international position, but our international position should influence the economy, and this can only be achieved if we strengthen our voice in Europe and NATO and if we adjust the scope and mix of our international strategic alliances.
NECESSARY GOODNESS GOODNESSRELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHURCH
Greece and the Greeks are distinguished, united and we are moving forward with a stable and unwavering national and historical continuity and consistency.
An integral, fundamental element of our identity and consciousness is Orthodoxy and our Church.
Any attempt to break the fabric of Faith and the Creeds that unite us and sustain us as a Nation is an act that the Independent Greeks will never allow.
