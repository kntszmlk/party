[C] Institutional and democratic reconstruction of the state.
SYRIZ A is not responsible for the client state created by the parties that ruled and destroyed the country.
We recognise the pathologies of public administration! We insist, however, that the Bmong governments have done nothing to change them.
On the contrary, the Greek public administration is currently on the verge of collapse.
We are implementing a comprehensive plan for democratic reform and rationalisation of the public administration, the state and the political system.
1. We change the structure of the Government
We change the structure of the Government to better plan, coordinate and implement the reconstruction of the country.
In the SYRIZ A government, the cabinet will not be decorative, but a powerful collective body for political planning and coordination.
�We abolish the numerous governmental bodies that function as breeding grounds for corruption and diffusion of political responsibility.
�Removing the public sector from armies of consultants and temporary employees.
We staff the offices of Ministers, Secretaries General and Governors from the ranks of civil servants.
2. We promote the objective evaluation of civil servants
the memorandum legislation on disciplinary law for civil servants;
the institution of availability within the framework of mobility to rationalise the distribution of staff between departments and ministries.
We restore the unconstitutionally dismissed.
the unconstitutional law on the evaluation of civil servants.
The evaluation of staff and services will be based on objective indicators.
3. We are decisively tackling bureaucracy and red tape.
We limit physical contact between administration and administrator to fight petty corruption;
the CCPs and link them to citizen service departments in all public services;
the electronic card for every citizen with all the necessary information for dealing with the public administration.
the issuance of building permits and shop licences with a drastic reduction of documentation and a substantial strengthening of controls during implementation;
a special office for codification of legislation under the responsibility of the Hellenic Parliament.
4. We break the triangle of interlocking (silk) political parties - economic oligarchy - banks.
Political parties
� We are reforming the framework for bank lending to parties, with the introduction of a borrowing ceiling, a ban on long-term borrowing and a general ban on borrowing more than a small part of state funding.
�We ensure full control and transparency of the parties' finances.
Mass media
� We are immediately activating the provisions of the laws which:(a) allow the Bank of Greece and the competent prosecuting authorities to carry out checks on the origin of the financing of companies;
(b) apply to all Public Limited Companies and provide that a viable company cannot operate indefinitely without being recapitalised.
We are launching from scratch a competition for media licences.
I don't know.
We are reviewing the institutional framework governing public procurement, based on the relevant European legislation.
We strengthen institutions of social control, transparency and accountability at all stages.
We are modernising the conditions for the design and implementation of public contracts.
We formulate an objective and transparent institutional framework for the conduct of public tenders.
We put an end to the photographic preaching!
An6doan franchise
We organise the collection of data and information on problematic tenders that are in progress and have been carried out in the last five years.
We ensure the immediate redress of any possible property or any other blovnas of the public sector in cases of "sinful" contracts;
the unconstitutional and offensive to democracy provisions that grant immunity to the Boards of Directors of the HFSF and the Hellenic Investment Fund;
5. We ensure legality and the rule of law everywhere.
We are consolidating all the control mechanisms into a single body reporting directly to the Prime Minister.
In this direction, the first measures concern:�The strengthening and reinforcement of the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Labour Inspectorate, in order to ensure legality in the private economy and public administration,
but also to cleanse the labour market from practices of exploitation and uninsured labour.
The consolidation of the successful anti-money laundering initiative.
The reactivation of the Commission's Behaviour Commission.
FINANCING OF A NATIONAL IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION PLAN
[1] Increased public revenues from 4 main sources
(a) Fighting corruption and tax evasion, with measures such as:
�Direct and decisive control of offshore companies and those on the Lagarde list and similar lists. �
Effective measures against smuggling of fuel, tobacco and other products.
(b) Stimulating demand
Measures to address the humanitarian crisis and measures such as the reintroduction of the minimum wage will stimulate economic activity and thus boost public revenues.
(c) Settlement and regulation of arrears to the tax and social security funds according to the income situation of citizens.
(d) Developmental use of public property.
instead of single-market privatisations and its sale for a price.
[2] Redistribution of public expenditure
It sought to boost development efforts and the welfare state.
That is why we are planning interventions such as a new objective and transparent system for public procurement and the execution of public works.
ECO3 STRUCTURE OF CONTEMPORARY K I
We envisage the gradual building of a modern welfare state, which will ensure guaranteed access for all citizens to a decent level of income, goods and services, based on a
public and social welfare state.a public and free education system, organised, which fosters critical thinking and provides education for all citizens.
SUPPORTING NATIONAL GROUPS such as large families, people with disabilities, people with chronic illnesses, victims of abuse.
A COMPLETE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM which we are beginning to build by gradually addressing the huge problems that the Memoranda have created in the present system.
4. We are opening the way for productive reconstructionWith the immediate measures to restart the economy we are opening the way for the productive reconstruction of the country.
Through productive reconstruction we seek:-to meet basic social needs:-by
producing knowledge- and labour-intensive agricultural, agro-food, food and industrial goods.
By producing goods and services for housing, clothing, transport and health. � By
improving quality in standardisation, technological competence and innovation. � By
sustainably balancing the current account balance through changing the mix of products produced in Greece,
exploiting the export-oriented potential of many sectors of the Greek economy.
industrialisation through the implementation of a democratically determined, integrated and far-sighted industrial policy;
the all-round development of the country, exploiting the comparative advantages of each region;
the protection of the environment and the restructuring of the economy on social and ecological criteria.
The environment is a key asset in sectors such as agriculture, livestock and food, energy production, tourism, etc.
Productive reconstruction requires a new productive development model.
Where they dominate:
Popular participation and initiative.
Upgraded human labour.
upgraded knowledge and research, skilled technology and innovation.
The protection and utilisation of public property, not the selling off of it.
An institutionally reconstituted state, promoting recovery through a generous increase in public investment.
An economic system composed of a restructured public sector, a
private sector dominated by clear rules and small and medium-sized enterprises,
and a new, robust social sector investing in the principles of solidarity and cooperation.
Productive reconstruction needs changes in the constitution of the state.
A profound democratic reform that will reverse the roles between the central state and local institutions and where:
Central government will set the guidelines on issues such as economy and development, environment, social policy, etc.
Regions will be transformed into key development institutions.
The aim is to take significant responsibility for the Public Investment Programme and the Community Support Frameworks.
New institutions of social control and popular participation will make citizens active shapers of the productive, social and environmental reconstruction of our country.
Productive reconstruction is mainly focused on the following sectors: //||1. Agricultural Production - Food and Beverage Industry.
Ensuring nutritional adequacy and access for all to high quality food at affordable prices.
2. Energy production system
Energy sufficiency for production and consumption and gradual decoupling from fossil fuels.
3. New technologies and raw materials
Development of domestic research and production for the modernisation of industry and production of high value-added products with a low environmental footprint.
4. TourismSustainable tourism development through new and alternative forms of tourism.
Spreading the benefits throughout society
5. ShippingLeast coastline coverage of the Greek islands.
A body of the shipbuilding and repair industry.
Strengthening the employment of seafarers with guaranteed rights.
Increasing economic inputs from maritime transport.
6. Construction and building materialsFocus on quality interventions in existing buildings.
Seismic safe, environmentally friendly housing and public buildings.
An end to infrastructure privatisation
and an increase in the Public Investment Programme.
Development of the building materials industry with an emphasis on innovation.
FINANCING OF PRODUCTIVE RESTRUCTURING
1) The State will fully exercise its ownership rights and appoint management in the banks recapitalised with State funds.
2) Establish a public development bank, which will be responsible for financing the reconstruction of production.
3) Establish special purpose banks, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and agricultural production.
4) Support the development of local cooperative banks, which will play a special role in regional development.

6) Redesign the new NSRF so that its interventions promote the productive reconstruction programme.
7) Negotiate decisively with European partners to reduce public debt and its servicing costs.
A European Marshall-type development plan from which Greece will benefit.
8) We are exploring possibilities to develop equal relations with countries outside the European Union (China, Russia, countries of the Arab world and Latin America),
seeking transnational agreements and contracts between public enterprises and organisations for development purposes.
