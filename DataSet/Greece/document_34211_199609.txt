In these elections, citizens, men and women, have the power to overturn the rigged two-party system, to transform the elections of the couch and the zapping that the government and the opposition are promoting into elections of thought and battle.
SYNASPISM is the only party that had every reason to want early elections.
To get back into Parliament, to be decisively strengthened in Parliament and in society.
But the Greek people were not convinced by the pretextual appeal to national reasons for the necessity of going to the polls.
The electoral surprise and the non-equal conditions of their conduct dramatically indicate the lack of political reserves, inspiration and principles,
but also the great impasse of the protagonists of the two-party system who do not trust the effortless democratic functions.
Summary procedures make public debate more difficult and simply highlight issues of power and its possession.
The Prime Minister alone has destroyed the image of the measured leader who means what he says and wants to bring a new style and ethos.
He chose the beaten path.
He confirmed the assessment that he wants an "open cheque" and loose hands to continue the same policy.
THE PLUS IN PARLIAMENT
The PASOK government feared that if it stayed in power for another year and dealt with the major problems pending for that period, it would be forced to show the true face of its policy and would suffer irreparable damage.
The PASOK government with Simitis as Prime Minister and now leader of PASOK, insists on policies that have proven to be anti-growth and socially insensitive.
Greece is not the description given in the speeches of the Prime Minister and the exuberant promises of Mr.Evert.
Greece is the vast majority of wage earners, farmers, professionals, unemployed, young people, women, who every day find it difficult to stand on their feet with support and security for their future.
Greece is the citizens who demand democracy, culture, objective information, a new style and ethos, consistency of words and deeds.
Greece without a strong modern democratic left, which controls, proposes, creates, struggles, defends the rights and needs of our people, is a Greece that resists less, a Greece that creates less.
PASOK and ND have become comfortable in the management of power and in this comfort they have subordinated the interests of the country and the Greek people.
They are imbued with the logic of bilingualism and demagogy.
They are addicted to inaction, procrastination, inertia.
The new dynamic that the country needs cannot be formed as long as the domination of these forces continues.
Tomorrow will be the same as yesterday if managed by the same people.
The new era requires new forces, new faces, new policies.
That is why new correlations must emerge from the elections.
This country must have a strong SYN in its Parliament, as a useful force of hope and action, an expression of radical initiatives and interventions, a carrier of proposals, ideas and programmatic solutions.
PROGRESSIVE MODERNISATION, AN URGENT NEED TO OVERCOME THE DEADLOCKS
The issue of the modernisation of the country is central to these elections and expresses the need for social, productive and national reconstruction in the face of the accumulated deadlocks.
SYN did not wait for the current modernist fashion to formulate and present to the Greek people its views and proposals with perspective, a comprehensive plan and realism.
SYN's proposals constitute and promote a modernisation that is not neutral, that is not a dull technocratic process.
It is a progressive modernisation, which requires major upheavals, conflicts, upheavals in the system of governance, in the organisation of the state, in the use of available resources.
It requires struggles, intellectual and ideological competition, political proposals and social activation.
It will exist as a regenerative people's movement, it will take place with workers and active citizens, young people and women, it will be imbued with social, feminist and ecological sensitivity to inspire the people.
It demands equal participation of women and men in the centres where decisions are made and taken.
It is based on initiatives for Greece's active participation in the processes for the political and monetary unification of Europe in terms of democracy, social solidarity, real cohesion and convergence.
It demands concrete proposals for a radical reform of the Maastricht Treaty to address the democratic, social and ecological shortcomings.
The weakness and fear of PASOK and ND in the face of the radical reforms required by modernisation is the cause of the current quagmire.
They promoted conservative choices,κατασπατάλησαν with opacity of Community resources,δημιούργησαν the interconnections with extra-political centres and interests, and led politics and politicians to a generalised crisis of insolvency.
For us, for SYN, progressive modernisation is the obligatory and at the same time the privileged field of conflict with conservatism of any shade.
It is the field for the promotion of alternative left-wing policies, the field for the development of radical movements, the new approach to the politics and values of the Left.
It is an organic element of our democratic Socialist perspective.
THE PROGRAMME GUIDELINES OF THE CO�
For the Democratic Left, democratic modernisation means:
Reorientation of foreign policy
SYN proposes:
Radical reorientation of foreign policy, away from isolationism, defensism, nationalist rhetoric, patriotism,
entrapment in relations with the US and notions of dependency A
departure from the logic of political cost, which led the governments of the NewDemocracy and PASOK to address foreign policy issues from an internal and even petty party perspective.
Priority to political diplomatic initiatives over military armaments, because a Greece with strong international support is more difficult to challenge and less vulnerable than an isolated and introverted Greece.
The European option, the choice of a dynamic and active presence for a new impetus for European integration is the basic direction of our national strategy and a multidimensional foreign policy.
Europe's Common Foreign and Defence Policy is necessary and is based on the defeat of conservative views that want Europe to be an extension of NATO and the USA.
On relations with FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia): implementation of the interim agreement with FYROM, immediate and definitive resolution of the problem of the compound name.
On the Cyprus problem:  Exploiting the prospect of accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union for a just and viable solution.
A solution on the basis of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation, which requires a rapprochement between the two communities.
Opposition to the doctrine of a single defence area between Greece and Cyprus, which, without contributing substantially to the defence of Cyprus, objectively weakens the international dimension of the Cyprus problem.
On the issue of ending Greek-Turkish relations and dealing with Turkish aggression, SYN believes that Greece's policy cannot be limited to the defence aspect.
Despite the obvious difficulties, it is necessary to create conditions for dialogue with Turkey, within the framework of international law.
The country needs such an integrated and coherent strategy.
The absence of a strategy, the successive regressions, the fragmentary and often contradictory manipulations, led to "no hurry" in relations with FYROM when the correlations deteriorate to the detriment of Greece,
to self-deception in the tension with the Imia crisis, to the heavy-handed and useful only for nationalist consumption "Molen Lave" of Gavdos, and to
the preparation of gigantic armament programmes that undermine the country's own development.
Deep cuts in economic and social policy�
The country needs a comprehensive recovery programme, which simultaneously addresses the three major problems:
a)The low rate of investment and the lack of growth
b)The reduction of social inequalities and the fight against unemployment and poverty
c)The improvement of living conditions, the
promotion of sustainable and sustainable development with respect for the environment.
SYN proposes:
Reforms for new resources, investment and growth
Radical and equitable fiscal reform with a change in the tax system, the institutional framework of services, technical infrastructure.
Immediate taxation of profits from bonds, treasury bills.
Application of the "alibi".
Taxation of real estate above a certain threshold, high incomes and agricultural businesses.
Objectification of the taxation of the self-employed.
Utilisation of existing presumptions and corrections, where there are unfair and levelling regulations, and introduction of new presumptions concerning luxury living.
Rational, planned, transparent and accelerated use of the resources of the Second Community Support Framework, under bipartisan and social control.
Reassessment, transparency and growth-oriented public spending.
Immediate start of a gradual reduction of defence spending through rationalisation.
Modern and functionally and entrepreneurially autonomous public utilities, preserving their public character and radically reorganising them.
Industrial strategy, with sectoral policies and clear priorities
and promoting environmentally compatible development
regional policy new technologies export growth support for dynamic M e m b e r s
the increase in employment
A long-term programme for the development and modernisation of the agricultural sector, which will ensure a satisfactory rural income, taking into account the structural problems of the rural economy, its potential for competitive production, the needs of our people, the trends of the European and international market and the integrated development of the countryside.
Planning and programming of tourism policy at national and regional level, with particular emphasis on general and specific tourism infrastructure, on new alternative forms of tourism, on its connection with the domestic development process, ensuring the executive role of the public sector at national level
so that the holdings meet the qualitative requirements of development and the organisation of the Greek tourism supply.
Reducing social inequalities. Tackling unemployment and poverty
Bravely addressing the basic overall needs of society by supporting and strengthening the welfare state,
with the fight against poverty,
social exclusion,
xenophobia and racism,
ensuring tolerable working conditions
and living conditions (health, safety, security, welfare, man-made and natural environment),
preparing for the future (education-research, technology)
The fight against unemployment and full employment as central and non-negotiable objectives of Greek society.
The need for a policy but above all measures to promote dynamic growth and investment,
to reduce the working time to 35 hours without reduction in pay,
to create new jobs in the social sector of the economy,
to create new and effective education and training structures,
to promote equal opportunities,
the professional integration and reintegration of women into the labour market,
for the regularisation and social integration of illegally employed foreigners,
to increase the duration and amount of unemployment benefits.
Ensuring a minimum income for all citizens
and more effective social security with a redistribution of income in favour of workers,
with the gradual aim that no family whose income from work is below the official poverty line.
Planning and successive actions at national, regional and local level for the prevention, preservation and upgrading of the environment
Policies that will ensure both rational use and management and energy saving.
Investments on the occasion of the Second Delors Package that will highlight environmentally friendly projects and activities that will protect and enhance the environment, and improve the country's physical and historical heritage.
Expand, complete and modernise the country's rail network.
Upgrading the quality of life in cities, strict protection of habitats, river deltas, forests, endangered flora and fauna of the country.
Review of the priorities and environmental impacts of certain "major projects".
Immediate reforms of the political system and institutions
SYN proposes:
Immediate introduction of proportional representation at all levels.
Legislative safeguarding of the vote of the Hellenes Abroad.
Radical reform of the Public Administration with decentralisation, rational structure and flexible production processes.
Decentralisation of the state with self-government.
Transfer of resources and responsibilities to local and prefectural government.
Institutionalisation of Regional Self-Government.
The 1998 elections to be held for all three levels of government.
The emergence of the Parliament as a centre of political decisions and central social control in all forms of the exercise of power and the management of public money.
Freeing the judiciary from government and party control.
Democratic nomination of supreme offices by a wider electorate.
A modern institutional framework for the mass media that would effectively address the phenomena of over-concentration and interlocking interests, as well as TV petty crime and misinformation.
A radical revision of the Constitution that the Semitic government has referred to the courts.
The aim is to crystallize in the charter all the necessary changes in the political system.
Strengthening the role of social rights through the promotion of effective participation.
Drawing up a "charter of rights" focusing on the protection of civil and minority rights.
STRONG PLUS. DEFEAT OF THE TWIN. NEW CORRELATIONS. NEW POLICIES.
PASOK and ND ruled autonomously and this model of governance gave complementary and alternating failures, left a strong taste in the mouth of the Greek citizen.
Time and opportunities were lost, resources and momentum were wasted.
Today everyone has discovered that the country is in decline.
PASOK wants changes and raids.
ND wants big changes and immediate solutions.
But the current reality is precisely the result of the policies and methods of governance of these two parties.
And for those who had doubts, the Simitis government with its 8 months of inaction proved that there is a huge gap between the announcements and the realisation of even a basic project.
The dilemma of these elections for every thinking citizen cannot be between PASOK and ND, but between the political scene of yesterday and the political scene of tomorrow.
So we say no to blanket authorizations to govern the country.
The guarantee for the change that the country needs is the strengthening of SYN.
A choice for the present and the future.
The absence of SYN from the Parliament for three whole years has not been able to break the militancy and the dynamic of initiatives and action.
But the Parliament was deprived of a political presence that would have indicated a different perspective for solving the country's problems.
From a force of control and criticism, of initiative and action.
Now the citizens, with a vote of logic, reflection and a fighting perspective, can bring SYN strong in the parliament.
And not only that.
They can shape a new scenario where the retreat of the forces of the two-party system, the achievement of self-reliance and the significant strengthening of SYN will give new correlations in Parliament and society, capable of supporting the progressive policies that the country needs.
In any case, and if, due to the electoral law that PASOK and ND have created to perpetuate their rotation in power, a new self-reliance and consequently persistence in the same bankrupt policies, SYN will again have a decisive role.
A strong SYN, from a position of programmatic, militant opposition, will be a force of struggle and control, a guarantee for the promotion of the necessary radical reforms in society and the political life of the country.
