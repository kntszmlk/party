The strong state protects citizens
Zero tolerance for lawbreaking and violence
We will take decisive action against crime and violence
Citizens should be able to feel safe everywhere in Germany
The guiding principle must be: Resist the beginnings
The beginnings are the tolerated neglect of public transportation and squares by drug scenes and alcoholic milieus, by vandalism, graffiti and harassment through aggressive begging
We don't want people to become accustomed to misdemeanors, shoplifting and drug use
Those who advocate the decriminalization of so-called ''petty offences'', as the Red-Greens do, lower inhibition thresholds, encourage lawbreakers and discourage law-abiding citizens
The end result is not less crime, but more crime
The end result is violence and serious crime
We want consistent prosecution of all breaches of the law by a motivated police force that is close to the people
We want to drive forward the reorientation of criminal law and give greater priority to the protection of victims
We have toughened the penalties for child abuse and violent offenses
Only prisoners who do not pose a danger are allowed into open prisons
The protection of citizens must take priority
Repeat offenders are identified quickly and reliably using a gene file
We want to protect our children and young people from dangerous criminals and the increasing influence of violence
The lives and safety of our children take priority over sex offenders' demands for rehabilitation
We want to take strong action against depictions in the media and on the internet that glorify violence and are repulsive, including through international legal standards and consistent cross-border investigations
We will consistently counter the alarming rise in child and youth crime
We focus on prevention through values-based education in families and schools,
on leisure activities and social support for young people
In order to make young people aware of their responsibility for their own actions, they should be more strongly obliged to make amends
Criminal behavior by young people must be followed by an unequivocal criminal sanction
In severe cases, placement in closed homes cannot be dispensed with
For criminal adolescents (up to the age of 21), sentencing under adult criminal law must once again become the rule
When applying juvenile criminal law, the aim is to increase the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years
CDU and CSU want to strengthen legal awareness
The important instances in our society that convey values - family, school, churches - are of particular importance in education
The media must also be aware of their social responsibility
We have to put an end to the culture of looking the other way
We want to promote a responsible approach, help and active neighborliness
Models such as the ''Sicherheitswacht'' in Bavaria have proven their worth
They should be introduced in all federal states
We want protection against violence and crime to be a central and joint task of the state and citizens
We want to prevent organized crime from becoming a cancer in society
Criminals' homes must be able to be effectively bugged and monitored with video cameras for evidence purposes
We will ensure a more effective fight against crime in the European Union
and improve cooperation with the security authorities in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe
We want to put a stop to smuggling organizations
Increasing brutality and the use of state-of-the-art technology require a Europe-wide strategy for this purpose
EU borders must be secured against illegal immigration and organized smuggling by each member state
We will work towards greater cooperation between the border guards, police and judiciary of the countries involved
Anyone who abuses our right to hospitality must leave our country and know that they will not be allowed to return
We will take consistent action against criminal foreigners who are in Germany illegally or for a short time
We firmly reject any trivialization and approval of narcotics
We will stick to our drug policy: Targeted prevention, consistent prosecution and help for addicts
We will not allow the state to dispense hashish in pharmacies or heroin
We will step up the fight against the drug mafia
We will toughen the penalties for major dealers and drug bosses, for those behind the scenes and those behind the scenes
Safeguard quality of life in town and country - strengthen rural agriculture - continue successful environmental policy
Keeping the city and countryside alive as a homeland and shaping them in a modern way
We live in a world that is becoming ever more open and borderless, in which upheavals and changes follow each other ever more quickly and which offers each of us ever greater opportunities
At the same time, however, the need for familiarity and rootedness is also growing
There is a growing need for regional identity and a sense of home
Home - these are our villages and communities, our towns and cities, where we were born and grew up, where we live and work, where we retire in old age
In a mobile society, this place may change, but the desire for belonging, for familiarity, tends to increase as a result
CDU and CSU want to strengthen local and regional ties
Germany is a cultural state with a rich diversity of historically grown traditions, customs and local history
We want to preserve this cultural diversity, which makes up the special quality of life in our cities and communities
This includes, in particular, balanced spatial and urban planning
Germany has a more balanced relationship between urban conurbations and rural areas than almost any other country
We will do everything in our power to maintain this balanced structure
This requires in particular that the areas of living, working, trade and leisure activities in towns, villages and the countryside are optimally coordinated and interlinked with each other
The CDU and CSU will provide special support to local authorities in this task
The responsibilities should be as close as possible to the citizens in the area of local self-government
Cities and municipalities must receive the necessary resources to be able to perform their self-administration tasks effectively in the service of citizens
We see efficient municipalities as the decisive counterweight to the centralization and bureaucratization tendencies of our time
More quality of life for our cities
Our cities have always been more than just places where people live and work
They are commercial and shopping centers, educational institutions, places of entertainment, meeting places and places of integration
Our cities, which have grown over the centuries, with their diverse external appearance, their valuable buildings, their sights and their urban life, are part of our cultural heritage
They must remain liveable and attractive
Germany's major cities are Germany's calling card in the world
We want to revitalize our city centres as locations for diverse, medium-sized retail and service businesses
We will counteract the structural depletion of inner-city retail in particular
We reject the excessive establishment of large-scale shopping centers
This is because shopping centers on greenfield sites not only promote urban sprawl and increase land consumption, they also cause increased traffic and long journeys, while older people and mothers with children in particular are increasingly deprived of shopping opportunities around the corner
There must at least be equal opportunities between urban and suburban centers
This can be achieved, for example, through effective ''city management'' and ''city logistics'' including optimized local public transport
Excessive traffic calming that drives people out of the city with their shopping and lifestyle habits instead of keeping them in the city center is not conducive to urban development
The modernization of the inner-city housing stock will play a more important role in our housing subsidies
Our city centers should remain attractive and safe places to live
Our citizens must be able to feel safe on streets and squares, in parks and in the subways of our cities at any time of day
Public neglect, aggressive begging, open drug scenes and graffiti have a considerable impact on the population's sense of security
The city center location is also suffering as a result
A stronger police and law enforcement presence is needed here
With the ''Safety Net'' campaign, we will take effective action against crime in cities
Vibrant city centers with retail and gastronomy are the best prevention for more security and less crime
Securing the future of rural areas
We need economically viable rural areas with vibrant villages and communities
A forward-looking policy for rural areas and the agriculture and forestry that characterize them is therefore a particular concern of the CDU and CSU
We will continue to improve the development opportunities of rural areas through an integrated structural policy whose primary goal is to maintain existing jobs and create new, future-oriented jobs
We want to use the new technologies to strengthen the economic power of rural areas
The opportunities offered by modern communication and information technology increase the chances of sustainable economic development in the regions
Young, qualified people must be offered prospects in rural areas
We will create a future-oriented and reliable framework for agriculture and forestry, trade, commerce and, above all, the retail sector that is friendly to small and medium-sized enterprises
Adequate local living conditions and maintaining mobility are particularly important for people in rural areas
Good transport connections and providing the population with services close to home therefore remain important goals of our policy
Strengthen rural agriculture
Rural areas and agriculture belong together
We will continue to secure the existence of an efficient farming sector in Germany that produces in an environmentally friendly and animal welfare-friendly manner under its own entrepreneurial responsibility
We want our agriculture to be able to meet the diverse requirements of our society - such as the supply of healthy food, the production of environmentally friendly raw materials, the preservation of natural resources and the maintenance of the cultural landscape - in the long term
We are continuing our policy to improve the economic and social conditions in agriculture and forestry and in rural areas as a whole
The CDU and CSU are committed to further developing the European Union's common agricultural policy on the basis of the 1992 reform
We want our farmers to be able to generate as much of their income as possible from market revenues
Excessive state regulation and continued dependence on premium payments offer no entrepreneurial prospects for farms
We reject caps that restrict competition and are hostile to performance
The member states need more leeway again when it comes to financing and shaping agricultural policy
CDU and CSU want to significantly strengthen the responsibility of the member states and regions and shift responsibilities back to them
This is something we strongly advocate at European level
The agricultural policy proposals of the EU Commission (Agenda 2000), with increasing burdens for our taxpayers and simultaneously decreasing incomes for farmers, are unacceptable
The CDU and CSU therefore emphatically reject Agenda 2000 in its present form
In the further development of EU agricultural policy, the CDU and CSU insist on solutions that offer German agriculture reliable prospects for the future
We want to achieve this in particular by easing the pressure on the milk and beef markets
We will advocate appropriate external protection in the upcoming WTO negotiations
and thus the high European environmental standards,
Animal welfare
and consumer protection standards
In the spirit of cooperation between environmental protection and agriculture, we firmly believe that there must be appropriate compensation for special ecological and landscape conservation services that go beyond the requirements of ''good professional practice''
We want to enshrine this in the Federal Nature Conservation Act - even against the opposition of the SPD
Protecting the natural foundations of life
We want to preserve the natural foundations of life for future generations
This is the core concern of our policy in Christian responsibility
Germany is an international leader in environmental policy because we see environmental protection, economic growth and employment as a single entity
In the further development of our environmental policy, we consistently rely on the instruments of the market: more personal responsibility for companies (e.g. eco-audit), voluntary self-commitment, take-back obligation of manufacturers in waste legislation
Our aim is to develop products and processes that have maximum environmental compatibility from the outset
We will press ahead with the adoption of an environmental code with the aim of making environmental law more manageable and therefore more practicable, especially for SMEs
Economic growth must not mean greater use of resources
We have already succeeded in decoupling energy consumption in Germany
In addition to the most efficient and rational use of fossil fuels and the expansion of renewable energies, nuclear energy will continue to make its contribution to the German energy industry
In terms of both CO2 reduction and the further development of international safety standards, which also serve to protect our own population, we cannot afford to abandon this cutting-edge technology
''Think globally, act locally'' - this means that success in the fight for ecological balance on this earth can only be achieved if each country makes its own contribution by means of national environmental policy
We are sticking to our goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 25 % by 2005
We want to double the share of renewable energies in the electricity supply - solar energy, hydropower and wind power - by 2010
And we want the rapid introduction of the 5- and 3-liter car
Unilateral national approaches to energy taxation, as demanded by the red-green coalition, are out of the question for us because they would massively jeopardize the competitiveness of our economy and thus our jobs
We are committed to harmonized, revenue-neutral and competition-neutral energy taxation across Europe
Reconstruction East has priority
Continuing the buildup - for a self-sustaining upswing
The reconstruction of the East is one of the most impressive success stories of this century
The new countries have visibly blossomed
People in East and West are rightly proud of the great progress made in economic reconstruction
However, further joint efforts are still required
For us, the reconstruction of the East remains a priority
Germany's great development achievements reflect its performance, which is admired and appreciated all over the world
It is based on three foundations: - The peaceful revolution with which the people in the new federal states overcame the SED dictatorship
- On the efforts and hardships of the people in the new federal states, who have mastered an unprecedented structural change with an enormous willingness to change and adapt, which has created the conditions for stable economic progress
- On the exemplary solidarity of the people in the West for the reconstruction in the East as a great national effort
Even if overcoming the consequences of 40 years of division and socialism has taken longer than many had originally expected and has put the resilience of the people in the new federal states to the test, there is no alternative to the path we have taken
We will continue on this path - step by step and with patience
The successes achieved so far are obvious
The infrastructure in the new federal states is already much more modern than in many parts of Europe
Efficient and innovative businesses in the skilled trades and SMEs have sprung up all over the new federal states
600,000 new companies have created 3.5 million jobs
In many newly created production facilities, highly qualified employees use state-of-the-art technology to manufacture competitive, top-class products
The East German economy is currently in a phase of stabilization and, in some cases, rapid growth in important future fields
Sectors such as the chemical industry, the metal and plastics processing industry, mechanical and vehicle engineering and electrical engineering are growing at an annual rate of between 10 % and 40 %
In foreign trade, companies in the new federal states achieve growth rates of over 20 % per year
The modern infrastructure offers additional opportunities for economic growth in the area of innovative, value-adding services
These successes are also the result of a willingness to take innovative paths and leave the beaten track
We have considerably more flexible collective agreements in the new federal states
and in some cases considerably more efficient planning and approval procedures than in the West, without superfluous bureaucracy, over-regulation and false perfectionism
We want to use this innovative impetus from the new federal states to make improvements in the West: For much simpler administrative procedures,
for the dismantling of superfluous standards and regulations,
for leaner administrations,
for the transfer of public tasks to the private sector,
for a resolute dismantling of our sprawling rule of law,
also for more dynamism in the negotiation of social interests and in political decision-making
Following the example of the new federal states, we want to drastically increase the number of competitive and future-proof jobs throughout Germany
To this end, we are pursuing a consistent innovation policy that will have a positive impact on both the old and the new federal states
We want to further expand our position as a high-tech country
We do not see cutting-edge and future technology as a threat, but as an opportunity for development throughout Germany
Biotechnology and genetic engineering are technologies of the future
They make an indispensable contribution to combating diseases with new medicines and to feeding a growing world population
We have created a spirit of optimism for start-ups: The number of biotechnology companies has doubled in each of the last two years
We will continue to promote this dynamic
100,000 new jobs have been created in telecommunications and multimedia in the last two years
Another 90000 will be added this year
We have laid the foundations for this through research funding and better framework conditions
We will ensure that Germany is one of the first locations in the world to have the next generation multimedia platform, the "Internet 2"
We have regained our leading position in the global market for environmental technology
In solar technology, groundbreaking investment decisions were made for Germany as a business location
We will also expand our leading position here
With the Transrapid, a product of German cutting-edge technology is being realized in our own country
In this way, we are improving the ecological balance of domestic German travel and the export opportunities of a promising "Made in Germany" transport system
" The construction of the Transrapid line between Hamburg and Berlin will primarily benefit the construction industry in the new federal states and offer employment opportunities for 18,000 people
As Europeans, we are striving for technological leadership in the aviation industry
The Airbus program provides direct jobs for 30000 people in Germany
Doubling is possible
The new A3XX megaliner must be built in Germany
This is what we stand for
We will continue to modernize and expand transport routes in order to improve the conditions for business locations
The major German Unity transport projects will be completed on time and on schedule to improve the flow of traffic
Any attempt to prevent or delay the necessary expansion is a slap in the face for those looking for a job
We will continue to optimize our funding policy
With the new promotion concept for Eastern Germany, we have made it clear that the development of competitive corporate structures will continue to be an absolute priority for our policy in the coming years
To this end, the entire range of funding instruments is being bundled and made more transparent
By switching to investment allowances, support is concentrated on those who are directly economically active
And it becomes more targeted by directly strengthening equity
We have made it easier for small but fast-growing companies, such as those found in eastern Germany, to raise capital via the stock exchange
As the service sector plays a key role in solving employment problems, production-related services will be a focus of support from now on
We want to provide special support for SMEs by doubling the existing allowances
At the same time, the investment allowance rates were doubled to 10 % and 20 % respectively until 2004 in order to create long-term planning security for investors in eastern Germany
Demand for goods from the new federal states must be further increased
To this end, companies from the new federal states must continue to participate appropriately in public contracts in the future
Marketable products and services are a decisive prerequisite for the medium-term success of a company and thus for the creation and safeguarding of jobs
Addressing the deficits that have arisen in East German industrial research will therefore remain a priority task in the coming years
Our policy focuses on building a competitive economy that offers sufficient income and employment opportunities for people through its own efforts
We are therefore focusing on stabilizing existing jobs
and economic growth
Last but not least, the realization of the major tax reform will make an outstanding contribution to the further reconstruction of the East
Thanks to our policy for more growth and employment, a trend reversal is also emerging on the labor market in the new federal states
This shows that our measures are working and our policy is successful
We remain committed to the ''Joint Initiative for More Jobs in Eastern Germany'' agreed with trade unions, employers, business and the banking industry
We call on the trade unions to return to the Joint Initiative as soon as possible and to live up to their shared responsibility
For the CDU and CSU, the primary labor market has priority
Our goal is to create permanent jobs in the regular labor market
The main task of the publicly funded employment sector is to improve the chances of reintegration into the regular labor market
Our focus is primarily on those people who are particularly hard hit by the difficult labor market situation, i.e. the long-term unemployed, single parents, older workers and people with health or qualification restrictions
We call on the local authorities and all public bodies to utilize the new scope we have created for measures to promote the labour market, particularly in the area of job creation schemes, as quickly and fully as possible
However, measures such as the "Regie-ABM" for jobseekers whose chances of finding work on the open labor market are particularly impaired also remain indispensable
It is important that the measures of active labor market policy not only provide the people concerned with financial security, but are also personally meaningful for them by providing them with additional qualifications that are useful for the labor market and help them make the transition to the regular labor market
East Germany has a future
The opportunities for accelerated, job-creating economic growth in the new federal states are good
We will be able to take advantage of these opportunities if everyone involved plays their part
National solidarity - the bond of unity
For us, joint assistance in the reconstruction of the East is an imperative of national solidarity - just as Germans from East and West, above all the soldiers of our Bundeswehr, demonstrated national solidarity in the Oderbruch region last summer
Solidarity requires an inner willingness to help, to stand by the other person
This inner willingness arises from mutual understanding, understanding for the situation of the other person, for their actions, for their motives, for their value convictions
National solidarity between Germans in East and West, understood in this way, must not be a one-way street
It is necessary for people in the West to develop an understanding for the people in the East, for their lives during four decades of division, under real existing socialism
Unfortunately, most people in the West still know little about everyday life in the GDR, about the different biographies and life experiences of the people there
It is also necessary for people in the East to develop an understanding for their fellow citizens in the West
Without the successes of democracy and the social market economy in the West, reunification would not have happened and support for the reconstruction of the East would not have been possible
In their peaceful revolution in 1989 and with the elections to the Volkskammer in 1990, the people in the East decided in free self-determination to join the Federal Republic of Germany
If East and West understand each other in this way, we can realize our goal of inner unity
Social cohesion - society of togetherness - friendship between generations
Freedom, solidarity, justice - values as the foundation of society
Our liberal and pluralistic society is based on shared fundamental values
Our community thrives on spiritual foundations that cannot be taken for granted and are not guaranteed for all time
We also need a stronger consensus on values in order to successfully tackle the challenges of the future
What is needed above all is the everyday example set by citizens and the strengthening of the important communities and institutions in our society that convey values - family, school, churches
The basis of our policy is the Christian understanding of mankind, the knowledge of God's good creation and the orientation towards Christian values
We support the churches in their work to provide guidance and offer a spiritual home
We want to strengthen the protection of religious beliefs against offensive attacks and insults
Our legal system also protects the religious beliefs of faith communities that are outside our Western Christian culture
However, this only applies insofar as the public peace and religious feelings of others are not violated by such forms of expression
We are committed to the inviolable dignity of the human being
Human dignity and life - at the beginning of life as well as at the end - are inviolable
We will continue to protect them
Every person is designed for and dependent on community with their fellow human beings
The freedom of the individual is realized and proven in the devotion to one's neighbour and in the shaping of human coexistence
Individuals must take responsibility for themselves and their fellow human beings
We want a society of greater social interaction
Community-building and community-preserving values such as responsibility, public spirit and charity are crucial for our future
We want to encourage and support those who are prepared to take responsibility for others and provide services to others
Many people, especially young people, are willing to help, participate and get involved
We want to give them impetus, show them goals that are worth the effort
We want to ensure considerably more public recognition for voluntary work in initiatives, associations and churches
Our society will only retain its human face if freedom, solidarity and justice remain its binding foundations
The CDU and CSU are particularly committed to preserving and strengthening the Christian values on which our liberal democracy is based
Right of way for the family
For us, the family is at the heart of human society
Even under changed social conditions, it remains the community of the future
We have radically improved family equalization,
Child benefit and child allowances significantly increased
By introducing a child-raising allowance and parental leave, we were able to provide tangible help to young families in a crucial phase of their lives
We have introduced and extended the recognition of child-raising services under pension law
By the year 2000, this recognition will be increased to 100% of the insured person's average earnings
The CDU and CSU have pushed through a nationwide supply of kindergarten places,
A new law on children was introduced, which places legitimate and illegitimate children on an equal legal footing
We will continue to strengthen families
Above all, we want to ensure that work with and for children receives greater recognition
We will consistently use financial leeway in favor of the family, especially for child benefit and child-raising allowance
We want to promote the compatibility of family and work - above all through a needs-based range of daycare services
We want to help single parents in particular
Friendship of generations, partnership of man and woman
Marriage and family are indispensable institutions that stand the test of social change
Today, marital cohabitation is more strongly characterized by the equal interest of men and women in shaping their lives as partners
We want to take this interest into account
Marriage remains the best basis for the joint responsibility of mother and father in the upbringing of children
Our guiding principle is partnership and solidarity between the generations
Intergenerational solidarity does not only mean that the older generation enjoys a pension that reflects their lifetime achievements
Generational solidarity also means that we must not live at the expense of those who come after us
This applies to public debt as well as to our use of natural resources
Making the welfare state fit for the future
To maintain the efficiency of social security systems, we will continue to restructure the welfare state
The introduction of long-term care insurance, which has radically improved the situation of over 1.7 million people in need of long-term care and the nursing staff, has shown that restructuring is not synonymous with downsizing, but means further development
With the 1999 pension reform, we distributed the financial consequences of increasing life expectancy and longer pension entitlement appropriately between contributors and pensioners, young and old
The next reform step will be the reform of the surviving dependants' pension
We will also work to further strengthen the central role of the family in the intergenerational contract
Those who retire after 45 years of contributions should not have to accept any deductions
We want to encourage young people in particular to make supplementary provisions for old age at an early stage in order to stabilize old-age insurance comprehensively and effectively in the long term
We also advocate framework conditions that enable company pension schemes to continue to play their supplementary role within the pension system
Our population will continue to have access to first-class healthcare with comprehensive social protection in the future
The CDU and CSU have made a fundamental change with the healthcare reform - away from a pure limitation of expenditure and towards a healthcare policy that is oriented towards people and their medical needs
This shift towards more personal responsibility and less state regulation will also ensure a high quality of medical care in the future
No one in Germany is overburdened or marginalized because of their illness, age, origin, income or number of children
This is also ensured by the significantly improved hardship regulations
At the same time, we have now enjoyed six years of premium stability
This is also an important contribution to safeguarding our proven and exemplary healthcare system
The CDU and CSU will consistently pursue this path of a modern and innovation-open healthcare policy
The progressive conversion of regular jobs into 620/520 DM jobs is a misguided development
We will initiate a reform of marginal employment relationships that will create more dynamism in the area of low-wage employment and part-time work
The CDU and CSU reject abolition without replacement
We want to achieve a broader participation of employees in investment income - in particular through the introduction of investment-related wage components
In a first step, we want to promote wage increases and savings contributions used for company or inter-company capital formation by means of a savings allowance of 20 % (25 % in the new federal states) up to DM 800.
We have created the legal requirements for this
The promotion of owner-occupied and rental apartments will be continued
The CDU and CSU give priority to promoting home ownership
In future, housing subsidies will be geared more strongly towards the actual target groups, i.e. households that are unable to provide for themselves on the housing market
The aim here is to avoid incorrect conveyance
The CDU and CSU also want to adjust housing benefit to the changes in rents and incomes and correct structural undesirable developments
The upswing is here - more employment in Germany
The upturn is here: since the beginning of the year, the economy has been performing better than it has for a long time
Up to 3 % real growth is achievable in 1998 and things look even better for next year
More importantly, the long-awaited breakthrough has also been achieved on the labor market
The number of unemployed in Germany has fallen by 700,000 since the beginning of the year
The number of vacancies is constantly increasing
The demand for labor is increasing significantly
The CDU and CSU have created the conditions for this upswing with their reform policy for more growth and employment
These reforms must be continued
They must not be withdrawn, as announced by the SPD
We can win the competition between companies and ideas, tax, social and education systems if we continue to work courageously and resolutely on our future
The CDU and CSU are the forces that will push through the necessary changes
We will consistently continue along the path we have chosen for the benefit of the people in our country
Major tax reform: Relieving the burden on citizens and businesses
CDU and CSU want to noticeably reduce the burden on citizens and companies
We want our citizens to know: In the Bundestag elections, they will also vote on our proposal for a major tax reform
Lower tax rates,
fewer exceptions,
a simplified tax law
and a net relief of DM 30 billion for citizens and businesses - these are the contents of our reform
We want to reduce the initial income tax rate from 25.9% today to 15% in future
All tax rates must come down
We also want to reduce the top tax rate from the current 53% to 39%
We want to leave more money in people's pockets
This makes tax planning, tax avoidance and the shadow economy unattractive
We want to strengthen the competitiveness of companies and reduce the tax rates for income from commercial activities from the current 47% to 35%
International competition is also competition for a lower tax burden
Germany must be attractive for investors
We therefore want to reduce the corporation tax rate for distributed profits to 25% and for retained profits to 35%
At the same time, we want to simplify tax law and abolish exemptions
Fewer tax concessions and exemptions make tax law simpler and fairer
Performance must be worthwhile
The tax policy of the CDU and CSU brings relief for all
Relieve work from costs
The cost burden of labor is too high in Germany
We will continue the fundamental reorientation of our social security systems towards more personal responsibility and personal provision.
and to greater economy and efficiency
The principle that no one should be overburdened will continue to apply in the future
We want the contribution burden to fall below 40 percent by 2002 at the latest
More scope for private initiative - reduce government share - continue sound fiscal policy
We have set ourselves the goal of reducing the state's share to 46 percent by the year 2000 in order to create more scope for private initiatives
We have proven through consistent efforts that the law of rising government spending can be broken
We will maintain our successful course of strict consolidation of public budgets
We are sticking to our successful privatization policy
We will create more room for entrepreneurial initiatives and new jobs through further market openings and privatizations
That is why we want to privatize further federally owned companies and shareholdings, e.g. in the transport and telecommunications sectors,
Transferring tasks to more efficient private service providers
and private providers to participate more in the financing and operation of infrastructure measures
The federal states and local authorities are called upon to take the successful federal policy as a model and step up their efforts in this area
New culture of self-employment - SMEs as the engine of the economy
We want to strengthen SMEs as the foundation for Germany as a business location and as an engine for new jobs
To this end, we want to further improve the market opportunities for start-ups
and create a social climate that makes business start-ups and entrepreneurship a desirable goal
This also includes making the willingness to take more risks, commitment, creativity and entrepreneurial responsibility a central educational goal in schools, vocational schools and universities
We will improve the framework conditions for small and medium-sized companies in particular by reducing the tax burden and creating an investment-friendly climate
We will make progress in reducing bureaucratic hurdles for SMEs (regulations, reporting obligations)
We will develop additional advisory and support options for young entrepreneurs (information and broker exchanges)
Private capital for investments and new jobs in medium-sized companies and start-ups must be mobilized through attractive support measures
Innovations - Germany at the forefront of technological progress
We will further expand our position as a high-tech country by giving priority to key technologies
Biotechnology and genetic engineering, environmental technologies, multimedia and telecommunications technologies, aviation and aerospace with their key technologies - these will develop into the growth markets of the future, top industries with enormous employment opportunities
In order to be at the forefront of modern transport technologies, we will promote traffic guidance systems and implement the Transrapid as a German cutting-edge technology in our own country
So that we can compete even more effectively, We willlink basic research and applied research more closely and improve technology transfer
This will enable us to ensure faster commercialization and make important research results more easily accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (innovation databases, innovation advisory centers)
We will achieve optimum networking of road, rail, waterway and airports, We will
take measures to ensure a fairer allocation of transport infrastructure costs
In the field of energy supply, we will adhere to the energy mix
We want to double the share of renewable energies in electricity generation - biomass, solar energy, hydropower and wind power - by 2010
Nuclear power remains indispensable, also for environmental reasons
More flexibility on the labor market
Employment-oriented wage policy is an indispensable prerequisite for more jobs in Germany
Forces calling for the "end of modesty" are acting irresponsibly
We support the collective bargaining partners in their efforts to make company working hours more flexible (working time accounts), to introduce stronger performance- and earnings-based salary components and to reduce overtime It is the
It is the task of the employment services to ensure the effective placement of workers
will continue to improve employment promotion The
privatization of employment services is another new approach that we intend to make greater use of
Already today, employment offices are commissioning third parties to place long-term unemployed
This approach must be used to a greater extent and extended to other areas
Strengthen incentives to work - combat abuses
The traditional full-time job is no longer the sole norm, nor is it sought by everyone
Many are looking for a part-time
job Some would also be satisfied with a simple job
We will take better account of these needs
An acceptable employment opportunity must be available to everyone - for the low-skilled, those threatened by long-term unemployment, also through the creation of employment relationships on a non-profit basis
Already today, the municipalities employ more than 200,000 social welfare recipients who are capable of working That is
almost three times as many as three years ago
We want to help, We want to helpexpand this employment offer
Our goal is to provide every long-term unemployed person who cannot be offered a job with a non-profit job via the municipalities in the medium term
However, such state-supported employment relationships must not jeopardize the development opportunities of medium-sized companies
We are committed to improving the incentives for taking up work
Restoring simpler requirement profiles, entry-level tariffs, using the opportunities offered by the new integration contracts, and a willingness to give lower-skilled workers a chance are important contributions, that we are demanding from the collective bargaining partners
By introducing a lower entry tax rate of 15 percent, we are making low-paid work more attractive
We have successfully pushed through the welfare reform and developed a model that allows welfare recipients - depending on their marital status - to keep a larger share of their additional earnings in addition to receiving welfare
Everyone, who works should earn more than if he or she does not work
In a further step, we want to make the idea of an improved combination of state benefits and earned income available to recipients of unemployment assistance It
It must also be worthwhile for these groups to take up low-paid work, because they retain part of their state benefits or insurance benefits
We want to develop a combined wage model that optimally combines collectively agreed low wages with a redesigned transfer payment based on need, including the financial resources available for this from social welfare and unemployment benefits
can be put to better use
Because it is always better to finance work than unemployment We
want to combat the misuse of social benefits consistently and effectively Those
who demand benefits from the community must also be prepared to do something in return We
will combat undeclared work on a sustained basis
Reforming education - the best opportunities for youth
Solid vocational training is the best precaution against the risk of unemployment
To ensure that weaker performers also have a chance in the labor market, there is a need for an appropriate range of education and greater overall differentiation in the education system
This also includes two-year training courses
CDU and CSU want to create new training occupations with predominantly practical qualifications
We are committed to ensuring that dual vocational training remains adaptable, by developing new and modernized occupational profiles in good time that reflect changes in the economy and society
In order to remain competitive internationally, we want to strengthen general education and shorten initial training so that people can enter working life earlier
Knowledge and values go hand in hand
For us, therefore, religious education will retain its permanent place as a regular subject in public schools
We are committed to ensuringthat the performance of schools in the individual states be determined in an appropriate manner so that the comparability of school-leaving qualifications can be ensured
In a cosmopolitan modern service and industrial society, economic contexts, foreign languages and the use of new media must be taught much more intensively in the future
We will strengthen the performance of our institutions of higher educationby increasing their flexibility and giving them more room for maneuver
Universities should be able to develop their own profiles and compete more closely with one another
Funding should be linked more closely to the performance of the universities
This includes not only research performance, but also the quality of teaching and the number of students who graduate on time
Fast and efficient management
In order for the rule of law to fulfill its tasks effectively, it must concentrate on the essentials
Economic dynamism and innovative capacity must not be stifled by government regulation and bureaucratic perfectionism
In order to better curb overregulation and excessive regulation, we want to allow deviations from legal requirements, such as standards, minimum sizes, test benchmarks and the like, in justified cases in future
We want to use opening and experimental clauses to open up federal laws for pragmatic and flexible local application
Simpler, faster procedures, such as the auditing process and project management, correspond to a new understanding of administration as a public service
We have taken measures to make the public sector as a whole more performance-oriented, flexible and efficient
We are sticking to the civil service
The increased use of modern information technology and new management and control instruments are part of a fundamental modernization of the administration
Public budgeting is being reformed to enable cost transparency in order to improve economy and efficiency
Strengthening federalism - priority for smaller units
CDU and CSU want a lively federalism with more competition between the federal states
We need to return to a situation where the federal and state governments can shape their own areas of responsibility
Mixed competencies, confusing responsibilities and participation rights, which can be misused as a blocking instrument, must be eliminated
Federal laws should only be subject to the approval of the Bundesrat if they really interfere with state interests; at the same time, the states should be given back more of their own powers
In order to achieve more federal competition, the CDU and CSU want to reform the fiscal equalization system and the financial constitution in Germany
We want more tax autonomy for the federal states
Greater tax autonomy gives the federal states more room for maneuver
It enables flexibility and targeted competition for optimal location conditions for jobs and the economy
We need to make the distribution of tax revenue between the federal, state and local governments in the financial constitution and the fiscal equalization system more transparent and better regulated
Consideration should be given to a clear separation system that allocates indirect taxes to the federal government and direct taxes to the federal states, for example, as well as a model in which the federal states are allowed to levy their own assessment rates on income and corporation tax
When reorganizing the fiscal equalization system, we will ensure that the responsibility of the federal states for growth and tax revenues is strengthened
The burden of financing must lie with the state level, which is also responsible for the fulfillment of tasks
We are sticking to the priority for the reconstruction of the East
The duty of national solidarity requires that structural disadvantages, particularly in the new federal states, and the consequential burdens of socialism be compensated for
While maintaining the principle of solidarity, the idea of competition can also be applied to the restructuring of our social security systems
With a view to the future viability of German federalism in a united Europe, we also want to facilitate various forms of closer cooperation and collaboration between the federal states
Germany's responsibility for Europe and in the world
Advancing the united Europe
CDU and CSU want to further advance European unification
European integration will determine the future of our continent
Anchoring our country in the European Union and the single European currency are in Germany's interests
We have a historically unique opportunity to create a lasting peace order in a free and stable Europe
Our vision is a Europe of nations and regions
CDU and CSU say no to a centralized European federal state
CDU and CSU have a clear program for Europe: - CDU and CSU have ensured that the Economic and Monetary Union is a community of stability
Only with a hard common currency can 300 million Europeans successfully assert themselves in the increasingly intense international competition
The CDU and CSU have ensured that the euro will be as stable as the mark
We have created a historically unprecedented culture of stability in Europe
CDU and CSU will remain guarantors of stability in Europe in the future
We do not want a socialist Europe of redistribution
- CDU and CSU are in favor of a strong Europe that citizens trust
Europe will only overcome the major challenges of the 21st century if it is close to its citizens and can count on their support
The CDU and CSU have brought the federal idea of subsidiarity to Europe
We want a Europe that concentrates on tasks that can only be solved at European level: Common foreign and security policy, combating international crime, managing global asylum and refugee flows and common standards in environmental protection
Citizens will only accept decisions at European level if the corresponding regulations cannot be made sufficiently at local, regional and national level
And if at the same time it is clear that a decision at European level is absolutely necessary and in the interests of the people
- CDU and CSU want to shift competences back to nation states and the regions unless joint action is required
Local, regional or national particularities must be sufficiently taken into account in the decision-making process
We want greater control of the EU Commission and the EU administration
The rights of the European Parliament must be further strengthened accordingly
- CDU and CSU strongly advocate fair burden-sharing in the financing of Europe
We will therefore advocate a reorganization of Community finances
Future tasks of the European Union must be fulfilled from the existing financial framework
The funds for future structural funding in the European Union must be limited
In making the necessary savings, we will prevent an above-average burden on Germany and a disadvantage for our rural areas
Member states and regions need more leeway to promote their companies on their own responsibility
Benefits from the Cohesion Fund to participating states of the monetary union must be phased out quickly
- CDU and CSU reject a transfer union with additional burdens for German taxpayers
Red-Green demands for an EU employment program and a harmonization of social standards are not affordable and would be irresponsible at Germany's expense
- Enlargement to the east is in Germany's political and economic interests and places our country at the heart of the European Union
The CDU and CSU want to conduct the EU accession negotiations with the first six candidate countries swiftly but carefully
Sufficiently long transition periods after accession are in the interests of both the accession countries and the European Union due to the major differences in economic development
- The progress made in the Amsterdam Treaty must be used to improve the fight against international crime.
and a strict limitation of immigration should be used
In the area of asylum law, a fair distribution of the burden of asylum seekers among the EU member states is necessary
Repatriates and displaced persons
Our concern for the Germans in Russia and in the other countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe is an imperative of national solidarity
Late repatriates are Germans and have a right to come to Germany within the framework of the orderly admission procedure and to build a future for themselves and their families here
At the same time, we want to help ensure that those who want to stay have secure prospects in their home country
The CDU and CSU want to intensively involve the German expellees and German ethnic groups in Central and Eastern Europe in the cooperation with our eastern neighbors - especially with regard to the eastward enlargement of the European Union
The freedom of movement and freedom of establishment in the European Union is a step towards realizing the right to a homeland for German expellees as well - in a Europe that sees itself as a community of law and values and in which the peoples and ethnic groups can live together in harmony and without legal discrimination, even from the past, with mutual respect and promotion of their respective identities
Securing peace, freedom and stability: Yes to NATO and the Bundeswehr
Germany must remain a reliable and loyal partner in assuming responsibility for peace and freedom
The CDU and CSU have pushed through the participation of the Bundeswehr in NATO peacekeeping missions, while the Red-Greens have fiercely opposed this as the ''militarization of German foreign policy''
Germany will continue to face up to its responsibilities in the future
Bundeswehr soldiers perform outstanding peace service in Bosnia
We want to strengthen NATO as a guarantor of peace, freedom and stability in Europe
There is no alternative to NATO
We will further develop NATO as a community of values and defense alliance into an alliance for stability and crisis management
NATO must be open to other candidates
Determination and the ability to act must remain guaranteed
The Western European Union is the European pillar of NATO and the EU's defense policy arm
The Common Foreign and Security Policy strengthens the EU's position in international politics
Security policy cooperation with Russia and Ukraine is of particular importance here
With the CDU and CSU, there will be no weakening or gradual dissolution of NATO along the lines of the red-green model
CDU and CSU want a balanced alliance between Europe and America
The United States must remain a present security force in Europe in the future
We want to strengthen and further expand our close partnership with the United States
We want to bring about agreement between the European part of NATO, the Western European Union and the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union
The European Union's foreign and security policy must become more effective
We will continue to ensure the conditions for a modern and efficient Bundeswehr
The peacetime size of the Bundeswehr of 340,000 soldiers and the balanced mix of conscripts, temporary and professional soldiers meet the security policy requirements of today and tomorrow
We are sticking to compulsory military service
It is an indispensable basis for the successful integration of our Bundeswehr into the state and society
We want a Bundeswehr that is characterized by the model of the citizen in uniform and the concept of Innere Führung
Our soldiers are well trained and highly motivated
They proved their worth during the flood disaster on the Oder and thus made a visible contribution to Germany's internal unity
We will also protect our soldiers from slander and personal defamation under criminal law
We will continue to hold public pledges throughout Germany
Restrict immigration - demand and promote integration
Germany is a country that welcomes foreigners
We are open-minded and hospitable
More civil war refugees have found refuge in Germany than in any other European country
However, if our country is to remain friendly to foreigners, the Germans' ability and willingness to integrate must not be overburdened
This is why the influx must be kept as limited as possible
Anyone who demands immigration for our densely populated country is jeopardizing domestic peace
It also encourages radical forces
Germany cannot cope with increased immigration
We will do everything in our power to prevent illegal immigration
The CDU and CSU have pushed through the new asylum law against many years of resistance from the Red-Greens and have thus successfully curbed abuse
Compared to the early 1990s, the number of applicants has fallen to less than a quarter
We will not allow the SPD and the Greens to undermine the new asylum law when it comes to deportations
Politically persecuted people should still be able to find protection
However, this is only possible if we continue to consistently prevent abuse
Foreigners who only come to Germany to take advantage of our social benefits and foreigners who destroy their identity papers to thwart their deportation will in future only receive the most necessary benefits: food, shared accommodation, clothing, treatment for acute illness, no cash at all
This is what the CDU and CSU pushed through in the German Bundestag against the opposition of the Red-Greens
In doing so, we are deliberately exerting pressure on those who do not behave lawfully and thus want to force our state to provide services
We also want to extend this new regulation to foreigners who are obliged to leave the country and can reasonably be expected to do so, and to all illegal immigrants
Foreigners who are not granted the right to stay in Germany must leave our country again
We call on the SPD-led federal states to actually deport foreigners who can be deported from the country
Our development cooperation is also aimed at promoting the willingness of countries of origin to accept returns
We need clear European asylum regulations with unambiguous responsibilities, standardized services and fair burden-sharing
We are ready for a European harmonization in which the state grants asylum in accordance with the law
We want to help eliminate the causes of emigration in the countries of origin
The lower the pressure to emigrate, the lower the pressure to immigrate to European countries
That is why it is so important that the United Nations - and NATO and other countries on its behalf - intervene throughout the world to regulate conflicts and settle disputes, because armed conflicts and acts of violence are still the main cause of refugee and migration movements
We must continue to counter poverty migration from the Third World with efficient measures to promote development and help people to help themselves
We want to further promote the integration of foreign citizens who are living here legally on a permanent basis
This integration also takes place in many places, for example at work, at school, in sports clubs
Anyone who wants to live in Germany in the long term must also be prepared to integrate into our social and value system, to adapt to our way of life, to observe our legal system and our standards of behavior and to respect the fundamental beliefs of our community
Integration must be consciously desired and also striven for
The age at which children join the family must be set so that the necessary educational and extracurricular requirements for successful integration are met
As part of a reform of the citizenship law, we intend to grant further facilitations for the acquisition of German citizenship as a conclusion to successful integration
However, anyone who wants to become German must be prepared to give up their old citizenship
The most important requirements for naturalization are a command of the German language and a commitment to our Basic Law
We want to integrate those who live here permanently and legally;
Expulsion of those who grossly violate the legal order in Germany,
Limiting the influx
and prevention of illegal immigration in order not to overburden the Germans' ability and willingness to integrate;
Tackling the causes of migration in the countries of origin - this is the only way to create a sensible immigration policy for Germany and Europe
Commitment to the One World
We want to fulfill our responsibility for peace
and sustainable development in the 21st century
We offer people in developing countries our help to help themselves
The prerequisite for our aid is that the countries concerned create a suitable framework for development, i.e. respect for human rights,
Rule of law and legal certainty,
a socially oriented market economy,
Development orientation of state action
When we get involved in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment, we are also making an important contribution to the protection of natural resources
Because underdevelopment and environmental degradation are closely linked
Many of the environmental problems we face today cannot be solved at national level
The ecological challenge is a challenge on a global scale and can only be tackled on a global scale
We will therefore drive forward the harmonization of environmental protection standards in Europe and worldwide
