- We call for an orderly dissolution of the euro area.
Germany does not need the euro.
The euro is damaging other countries.
- We call for the reintroduction of national currencies or the creation of smaller and more stable currency alliances.
The reintroduction of the DM must not be taboo.
- We call for an amendment of the European treaties to allow any state to leave the euro.
Every nation must be allowed to decide democratically about its currency.
- We demand that Germany enforces this right to leave the euro by blocking further ESM bailout loans with its veto.
- We demand that the costs of the so-called rescue policy are not borne by the taxpayer.
Banks, hedge funds and large private investors are the beneficiaries of this policy.
They have to pay for it first.
- We demand that hopelessly over-indebted states be relieved of their debt by means of a debt haircut.
- In the debt crisis, banks must bear their own losses or be stabilized at the expense of their major private creditors.
- We demand an immediate ban on the purchase of junk securities by the European Central Bank.
Inflation must not be allowed to eat away at people's savings.
European policy
- We affirm a Europe of sovereign states with a common internal market.
We want to live together in friendship and good neighborliness.
- We insist on the full budgetary rights of national parliaments.
We firmly reject a transfer union or even a centralized euro state.
- We will ensure that legislative powers are shifted back to the national parliaments. - We will push
for a reform of the EU in order to reduce the Brussels bureaucracy
and to promote transparency and proximity to the citizens.
- The European Parliament has failed in its control of Brussels.
We strongly support David Cameron's positions to streamline the EU through more competition and ownership.
Rule of law and democracy
- We demand that the rule of law be fully respected.
State bodies may not disregard laws and treaties even in individual cases.
Rather, they are to be respected according to their letter and spirit.
- The actions of any German government find their limitations in international law, in the Basic Law and in the European Treaties.
These are of fundamental importance to our society and must be strictly adhered to.
- We demand a strengthening of democracy and democratic civil rights.
We want to introduce referendums and initiatives based on the Swiss model.
This applies in particular to the ceding of important powers to the EU.
- Parties should participate in the political system, but not control it.
- We call for more direct democracy in the parties as well.
The people should determine the will of the parties, not the other way around.
- We demand that members of the Bundestag devote their full working capacity to parliamentary work.
The mandate must not suffer from paid sideline activities.
- We are committed to ensuring that even unconventional opinions are discussed openly in public discourse, as long as the opinions do not violate the values of the Basic Law.
Public finances and taxes
- We demand that the debt brake be respected and that mountains of debt be reduced.
Germany also has much more debt than is permissible.
- We demand that the liability risks arising from the euro bailout policy finally be taken into account in financial planning.
At present, sand is deliberately being thrown in the eyes of the citizens.
- We call for a drastic simplification of tax law based on the progressive Kirchhof tax model.
The citizen must be able to understand why he is being taxed and at what rate.
Old age security and family
- The euro crisis is endangering all forms of retirement provision through over-indebtedness and minimal interest rates.
The debts of the euro crisis must not lead to a pension based on cash flow.
- We demand that children be taken more into account when calculating pensions.
- Germany has too few children.
Pension and health insurance therefore have feet of clay.
Germany must become more child- and family-friendly.
- We stand for the protection of the family as the nucleus of society.
Supporting families in a spirit of solidarity is an investment in our common future and an essential part of the intergenerational contract.
Education
- We call for uniform nationwide educational standards based on the best school systems in Germany.
- We demand that education be promoted as the core task of the family.
Kitas and schools must complement this in a meaningful way.
Nothing is more important for our future than the education of our children.
- First and foremost, parents are responsible for the education and upbringing of their children.
The state must help them to fulfill this task.
Early childhood education services should be available regardless of fa-mily background.
- We call for a high-quality university system that provides students with adequate care and support options.
It must also be possible to return to proven diploma and state examination courses.
Energy policy
- We demand a sustainable energy concept for affordable energy.
It is unacceptable that the population has to pay with drastically increasing prices for the headless and conceptless policy of the Federal Government.
- We demand a reform of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG).
It is anti-social to finance subsidies for solar and wind energy through electricity prices.
- We demand that subsidies for renewable energies be financed from general tax revenues instead.
It must be disclosed which type of energy is subsidized and by how much.
Integration policy
- We call for a reorganization of immigration law.
Germany needs qualified immigration that is willing to integrate.
- We call for an immigration law based on the Canadian model.
Disorderly immigration into our social systems must be stopped at all costs.
- Serious political persecutees must be able to find asylum in Germany.
Humane treatment also includes allowing asylum seekers to work here.
