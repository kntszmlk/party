SPD: Politics for the majority 48
Germany needs a change of policy - The time for change is now
Germany is a strong country
But it has a weak federal government
Our country has great opportunities
These opportunities must be seized
We can meet the challenges of the 21st century
For this, Germany needs new policies and a new government
Germany needs a new policy for work, innovation and justice
Our country needs a policy for new economic dynamism
and for new jobs
A policy that provides for economic, technological and ecological innovations and for social progress
A policy that aims for social consensus
and for social justice
Germany needs a new government
Credibility, predictability and reliability must once again become the guiding principles of government policy
People in our country know from their daily lives that change is necessary in order to take advantage of the opportunities of the new era
They are therefore further ahead than their previous government
There has been a profound estrangement between those who govern and those who are governed
If Germany is to get back on track, there is no way around a change of government
Germany needs a new spirit of optimism
The change of government in Bonn is the best immediate program for more growth
and new jobs
The SPD is ready to assume government responsibility for Germany
We will lead our country into the 21st century - safely and fairly
New jobs
Reducing unemployment - that will be the primary goal of the SPD-led federal government
Creating jobs and securing jobs - that is the focus of our program
Because reducing unemployment is the key to solving our country's economic, financial and social problems
In the fight against unemployment, we will use the strengths that have made our country one of the world's largest economies: Qualification and willingness to perform, inventiveness and decisiveness, courage and discipline, flexibility, innovative strength and a sense of responsibility
We can be proud of these great strengths and traditions of our country
These are the trump cards we will now play in order to be successful in global competition and to ensure more growth and new jobs
The SPD-led federal government will stop the rise in unemployment and ensure a fundamental turnaround in the labor market
Our long-term goal remains full employment: We want every woman and man to have a chance at a secure job
Innovations in business, government and society
In a world of change, not everything can remain as it is
Changes are necessary - in the world of work, in the design of social security, in the relationship between state and society
If we want to meet the challenges of the 21st century, we must be prepared to innovate in the economy, state and society
People are prepared to make the necessary changes - but they do not want social justice to be compromised in the process
Citizens can rely on this: The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the necessary changes are fair and equitable
We know that social innovation, not social cuts, is the basis for economic success
Renewal of the Social Market Economy
We will renew the social market economy: We rely on the forces of the market and on people's willingness to perform
And we build on social partnership and social stability
The renewal of the social market economy is the guarantor of prosperity and success, of social security and democratic stability
We will not allow the social consensus in our country to be damaged further and further
Our guiding principle is a modern participatory society in which everyone receives their fair share of the prosperity we have jointly achieved
Alliance for Jobs, Innovation and Justice
The innovations and changes that our country needs now are only possible if all social forces are mobilized
That is why we will forge an alliance for work, innovation and justice:
Immediately after coming to power, the Social Democratic Chancellor will bring unions and businesses together at one table and work with them to agree on the measures needed to reduce unemployment We
also want to invite the churches to this alliance
An alliance for work, innovation and justice includes a fair balance of interests based on the principle of mutual give and take
This will be our recipe for success for sustainable growth and new jobs: -
Comprehensive innovations in business, government and society
- Renewal of the social market economy and
- An alliance for work, innovation and justice.
Our vision for the Germany of the 21st century
We Social Democrats have a clear vision for the future of our country: We want a Germany with a strong economy
and with secure jobs
A country that is successful in the world's future markets with cutting-edge technology and top quality
A country of social security and justice
A country where families with children are in good hands
and in which equal rights and equality between women and men are not just on paper, but are a living reality
A country that gives its youth a future
and the elderly a sense of security and safety
A country that lives up to its responsibility for future generations
and is a global role model for the preservation of natural resources
A country that protects its citizens from crime and violence
A country that is no longer divided between East and West
A European Germany that is the engine of European unification
A Germany of peace,
of freedom
and international solidarity
We want to work to ensure that this vision becomes reality
The New Center: SPD
We invite all social forces to join us in realizing our vision for a modern and just Germany
We want to fill in the social rifts in our society and complete the internal unity of our country
We want work and prosperity for all
We see ourselves as a community of solidarity between the strongest and the weakest
We are counting on the top performers in our society: on the highly qualified and motivated employees, on the women and men who bear responsibility in families and schools for the upbringing and education of our children, on the forward-looking and committed managers and entrepreneurs, on the innovative and flexible SMEs, craftsmen and freelancers, on the courageous business founders, on the excellently trained computer scientists, doctors and engineers, on the inventive technicians and scientists and on the responsible German trade unions
These are people we build on
Together with these key players in our society, we are the new center of Germany
This new center also includes people who want their place in work and society in order to be able to demonstrate their desire to achieve
This also includes young people who are looking for training and work,
and all the people who are not resigned to unemployment and injustice
Together with the vast majority of citizens, we will ensure that Germany is on the up again
The time for change is here
1 Strong economy - new work
Germany needs more growth
and new jobs
A competitive economy is the basis for jobs, prosperity and social security
We focus on the renewal of the social market economy: on the combination of performance, competition and social responsibility
Market-based competition between companies is the best engine for innovation and new jobs
But only the interaction of market-based competition
and social stability creates the basis for a flourishing economy
We are committed to the comprehensive modernization of the economy, state and society
We build on the qualifications and motivation of our employees
We build on real entrepreneurs
We will encourage and promote an entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial drive everywhere and among everyone in Germany
We want to forge an alliance for work, innovation and justice: We can only solve our country's economic and social problems with a major joint effort by employees, companies, science and politics
Seizing the opportunities of globalization and European unification
We want the German economy to take advantage of the opportunities offered by globalization
Our response to the globalization of the economy is a policy of internal reform
and international cooperation
European unification is creating new opportunities for new prosperity and new jobs
Germany cannot win a cost-cutting race against the low-wage countries of this world
If we want to survive in international competition, We simply have to be more productive and better than our competitors The
future of the German economy lies in top products and top quality at competitive prices We
want competition between companies
We also want competition on performance for the world's best education system,
the most efficient research, the
latest technologies
and the most modern infrastructure;
This competition brings more prosperity for all
The globalized markets need a new and fair world economic order based on the principles of the social and ecological market economy
We want a framework for free and fair competition between companies We
reject protectionist efforts unequivocally
Growth, investment and new jobs
Reducing mass unemployment - this is at the heart of our policy
With a clever and pragmatic combination of supply and demand policy, we will ensure more growth and new jobs
Social democratic supply policy - this includes: -Strengthening education, vocational training and continuing education, research and science
- Offensive use and promotion of new technologies
- Reduction of statutory non-wage labor costs -
Effective assistance for small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups -
Strengthening the investment power of companies by lowering corporate tax rates
- Modernizing the state and reducing superfluous bureaucracy
Social democratic demand policy - this includes: -Tax relief, especially for employees and families
- Cyclical fiscal policy with a stabilization of public investment in the future at the highest possible level
Strengthen education, research and science
Germany must become an ideas factory
Innovation, education and new technologies - this is the social democratic response to the challenges of the 21st century
The SPD-led federal government will double future investments in education, research and science over the next five years
The translation of research results into new, marketable products must be accelerated
We want to realize a comprehensive education reform together with all stakeholders
The aims of this reform are more performance and more equal opportunities,
the equivalence of all courses of education
and the principle of promotion instead of selection
We want less bureaucracy, but more efficiency and more competition
Less regulation, but more flexibility, more permeability and more practical relevance
We want to anchor continuing education as the fourth pillar of the education system
The need for lifelong learning requires a close link between professional life and further training
Awakening for innovation and new technologies
We want to exploit the great opportunities offered by new technologies
To do this, we need a new open-mindedness for innovation and technological progress in our society
We want to launch an innovation offensive: Inbiotechnology and genetic engineering, in new materials, in information technology, in environmental protection technologies, in new energy systems and in transport technology, Germany should take a leading position in international competition
In order to secure our country's competitiveness, we also need a surge of innovation in Germany's major key industries, such as chemicals, mechanical engineering and the automotive industry
We want Germany to continue producing the world's best cars in the future
We want, that the most effective medicines and the most intelligent machines continue to be manufactured here
In the future, the best microprocessors and the most powerful solar cells should also be built in Germany
We want to promote modern work, production and service concepts
We will strengthen cooperation between university and non-university research institutions and companies and
promote the development of regional innovation networks In the
future, the promotion of "human capital" will be more important than the promotion of physical capital
Exploiting the opportunities of the information society
The SPD-led federal government wants to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new information and communications technologies
They open up new possibilities for future-proof jobs, for reconciling family and career, for preserving the environment, for better access to knowledge and information, and for greater participation in the democratic and cultural life of our society
In order to take advantage of these opportunities, people need the ability to use the new media actively and independently: media literacy is increasingly becoming a key qualification for the working and professional world of the 21st century
"All schools online" - we will pursue this goal with vigor
Create new markets
Germany needs more investment in new jobs
But companies will only invest more again if they can actually find buyers for their products - and
that is what is lacking
Exports alone are not enough Insufficient
domestic demand for goods and services is the key weak point in the economy
To strengthen the domestic economy, we need: -a targeted reduction in taxes and duties and
- an employment-oriented wage policy that ensures sufficient purchasing power in the context of productivity increases
Preserve tariff autonomy
The autonomy of collective bargaining has proven its worth
We reject all attempts to restrict them
The regional collective agreements ensure reliable framework conditions for companies and employees
We support the reform efforts of the parties to the collective agreement
Flexible solutions within the framework of sectoral collective agreements can take account of the varying performance of individual companies and the different conditions in the sectors, regions and companies, as well as the needs of employees
Flexible solutions in wage policy as well as in working time policy open up new opportunities for securing and creating jobs
The SPD will ensure equal opportunities for the parties to collective agreements (new version of Section 146 of the German Social Code III)
Shorter working hours and intelligent organization of work
An innovative economy needs an intelligent organization of work and flexibly designed working hours that are differentiated according to company size and industry
We call on companies to make full use of the existing flexibilization options available under collective agreements
With shorter and flexible working hours, expensive machinery and equipment can run longer without people having to work longer
Within the framework of flexible working hours, agreements with employees are possible that realize more time sovereignty More flexible
and shorter working hours are also necessary, to achieve a significant reduction in unemployment
We support the efforts of the collective bargaining parties to create new jobs through shorter working hours
We need more part-time jobs, for men and women
Overtime should be reduced as far as possible
Wherever possible, staff reductions should be avoided through employment-securing working time models
We also need more flexible working lives with more flexible transitions between work on the one hand and education, inactivity and retirement on the other hand
Strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups
SMEs and skilled trades are the backbone of the German economy
Small and medium-sized enterprises are the engine for growth and innovation, for jobs and training
The SPD-led federal government will improve the economic policy framework conditions for SMEs, skilled trades and start-ups:
- By reducing social security contributions, we will relieve companies of excessively high statutory non-wage labor costs
- This relief will particularly benefit small and medium-sized companies in the SME and skilled trades sectors
- We will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy by modernizing the state and administration
- This includes the simplification and acceleration of approval procedures
- We will concentrate support for SMEs and start-ups on a small number of programs, make them more flexible and transparent and bundle them under one roof
We want to strengthen the innovative capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises:
- Personnel cost subsidies are intended to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to hire research staff
- Cooperation with universities and research institutions is to be made easier for small and medium-sized enterprises
- Industrial joint research for smaller companies that cannot maintain their own research capacities is to be supported
Germany needs a new wave of founders
Our country needs start-ups and innovative young companies, especially in the high-tech and service sectors
Today, many innovative, high-growth companies find suitable financing opportunities only on the international financial markets
In Germany, the market for opportunity capital is still underdeveloped
We will change this We will
promote the provision of opportunity capital, to mobilize capital for new jobs and start-ups
This includes first and foremost strengthening the share as a financing instrument and more favorable framework conditions for participation in innovative companies
We will promote stock exchanges specially tailored to young companies and stimulate the involvement of private investors in venture capital and venture capital companies by providing incentives to spread risk
Exploiting employment opportunities in the service sector
There is great potential for new jobs in the service sector
To ensure that these new employment opportunities are exploited, Germany needs a new service culture
The new potential lies, on the one hand, in the area of industry-related services
This includes consulting, qualification and financial services
Trade in knowledge and information will increasingly develop into a service sector in its own right
Ecologically oriented services will become increasingly important with regard to environmentally friendly and sustainable development
We will promote the expansion and development of these service sectors by supporting innovative companies in small and medium-sized enterprises and the skilled trades There
is also great job potential in personal and household-related services
These include, for exampleCare assistance, childcare, household chores, complementary retail services, hotel and restaurant services, and some simple craft-related services
These employment opportunities often do not lead to concrete jobs because the services are too expensive On
the other hand, the wages that can be earned here are not enough for potential employeesin order to be able to exist on them
With a targeted reduction in taxes and duties, the SPD-led federal government will reduce the costs of labor and at the same time improve the net wages of employees In
this way, we will increase employment in the service sector
We want to bundle the supply of household-related services in private service agencies and create regular and socially secure employment relationships with living wages there
If required, each household can call on the services of this placement agency for the desired time
Payment for the service is made partly by the private household itself on theother hand by service vouchers, which are available for every private household
The costs of the vouchers are borne by the Federal Labor Office
This reduces the cost of work for private households in such a way that even people with normal incomes can afford household help and thus the desired employment effect is achieved
Through these new jobs, the Federal Labor Office saves money, which it would otherwise have to spend on unemployment benefits or unemployment assistance
This service concept thus corresponds to the principle of Finance work instead of paying for unemployment
New perspectives for rural areas and agriculture
Germany's rural areas are places for people to work, live and relax
The SPD-led federal government focuses on the strengths of rural areas
We want livable and vibrant towns and villages where people feel at home and where they and their children have a secure future
To further strengthen rural areas, we will ensure better integration of economic policy, agricultural policy and environmental policy
expand regional economic links and support independent local developments
Functioning agriculture remains an essential core element for the rural economy
This also includes production-related processing companies and well-developed regional economic cycles
Tourism, services, crafts and small and medium-sized enterprises open up new opportunities for growth and employment
We want an agricultural policy that - is based on the principle of sustainability and comprehensive land management
- enables the survival of farming in western Germany and
- does justice to the larger farm structures in eastern Germany
We want to enable agriculture to participate in the general increase in national economic prosperity and safeguard the value of its quality products Farming
services for the preservation of the cultural landscape must be recognized
Motivation and performance - sharing the say and the have
We advocate social partnership in companies and in society
We want a participatory society in which everyone receives their fair share of the prosperity we have earned together
We want employees to participate in capital and profits and in company decisions
The SPD-led federal government will improve the framework conditions for employee participation in productive capital
This includes - Support for investment wage agreements between the collective bargaining partners
- Promotion of employee participation in inter-company funds and
- Improvement of insolvency protection for these investments
The SPD-led federal government will work to - expand co-determination at the workplace and in the company
- the safeguarding and further development of qualified co-determination in companies and
- the expansion of co-determination rights in Europe
The CDU, CSU and FDP have damaged social peace in our country through their irresponsible encroachments on workers' rights
We will make wrong decisions - with regard to protection against dismissal,
- the bad weather allowance and
- Correct the continued payment of wages in the event of illness
Law and order in the labor market
Order must be restored to the labor market
Social dumping, wage dumping, illegal employment and systematic moonlighting undermine social security systems, erode the collective bargaining system and threaten the existence of legally operating companies
We want new forms of employment in the labor market, but we will not allow unfair competition or flight from social security
We will restore law and order to the labor market
That is why we will stop the abuse of 620 Mark/520 Mark jobs and fight bogus self-employment
We will fight illegal employment and undeclared work more effectively than before with an action program
To prevent social dumping, the principle of "equal pay for equal work in the same place" must be enforced by national and European regulations
The existing sanction options must be tightened so that general contractors can also be held liable for subcontractors acting illegally
Work instead of unemployment
The aim of the SPD-led federal government is to get the unemployed back into work as quickly as possible
Employment in the primary labor market has absolute priority
Our principle is "work instead of unemployment": Unemployment caused social costs of around 180 billion marks in 1997
We will ensure that in future this money is no longer spent mainly on unemployment benefits, but on financing training and work
This reduces expenditure on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and generates additional income from taxes and social security contributions
For all unemployed people who have been out of work for more than six months, the employment offices should develop an individual plan for returning to work together with those affected
If placement in a job is not immediately successful, we will build bridges to the primary labor market:
Companies that hire unemployed people are to receive - wage subsidies and
- Receive training aids
We will support collective agreements between trade unions and employers that open up new employment opportunities by providing subsidies
This involves, for example, models for partial retirement or entry-level part-time work for young people after vocational training
Both measures enable the additional recruitment of younger people
Similar to Scandinavia, we want to ensure that long-term unemployed people are placed as substitutes in company jobs that are vacant for a limited period of time due to parental leave or further training of the previous employees
This job rotation program can help the long-term unemployed return to permanent employment
We will also promote in-house training to adapt to new structures
We will link active labor market policy more closely with structural policy in the regions
The high and increasing long-term unemployment of low-skilled workers shows that we also need more simple jobs again
For new jobs with low hourly wages, we will use the money that was previously used to finance unemployment to relieve these jobs of social security contributions
This measure benefits employees and employers alike
Strengthening consumer rights
A functioning market economy needs well-informed consumers
We want to improve consumer advice and strengthen consumers' rights
Protection against health hazards is a particular priority
2 Fair taxes and sound finances
The SPD-led federal government wants a tax reform for new jobs, for more tax justice and for a simplification of German tax law
Our tax reform includes: -a reduction in wage and income tax rates
- an increase in child benefits
- a reduction in corporate tax rates
We are concerned - with tax relief for employees and families and
- with strengthening the investment power of companies
This must be done on the basis of sound public finances
Tax reform for work and justice 1999
The SPD-led federal government will implement a major tax reform as soon as it takes office
Together with the Social Democratic-led federal states, we will ensure that this tax reform comes into force as quickly as possible:
We want to see the start of this tax reform as early as the beginning of 1999
2500 Marks relief
The SPD tax reform brings a relief of about 2,500 marks per year for an average earning family with 2 children
Reduction of tax rates across the board
Our tax reform includes a reduction in tax rates across the entire range of the tax scale
This also includes an improvement in the basic tax-free allowance The
SPD's goal is to reduce the entry-level tax rate from the current 25 9 percent to 15 percent
In view of the difficult financial situation, this goal can only be achieved in steps
In a first step, we will reduce the entry-level tax rate to 21 9 percent
Our concept also includes a reduction in the top tax rate from the current 53 percent to 49 percent
If we succeed in securing financing, these tax rates can also be reduced further
Increase in child benefit to 250 marks
The SPD wants to increase child benefits by 30 marks to 250 marks a month for the 1st and 2nd child
This means an annual improvement of 360 marks per child for families
Strengthening the investment power of companies
The focus of our corporate tax reform is to reduce corporate tax rates to an internationally comparable level
We will also reduce the tax rate for commercial income in order to provide targeted relief for small and medium-sized enterprises and to strengthen their investment power
Our long-term goal is to achieve corporate taxation that is independent of legal form and, above all, promotes corporate investment activity
To strengthen the investment power of companies, we will ensure a reduction in statutory non-wage labor costs In particular, this will provide
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises in the SME and skilled trades sectors will be relieved of this burden
Tax reform of solidity and credibility
Our tax reform is solidly financed
After all, the state must not be deprived of the funds that are urgently needed for schools and universities, for research, for kindergartens and for a well-equipped police force
We will broaden the tax base
This will lead to a noticeable simplification of German tax law
The focus is on eliminating unjustified tax concessions
We will align companies' options for determining profits with international standards
Our measures to objectify the determination of profits are based primarily on US accounting tax law
In future, it will no longer be possible, for example, - to fully deduct current losses on speculative investments from tax, but only have to pay tax on half of any subsequent capital gains, or
- to be able to claim impairments in the company for tax purposes even if the reason for the impairment has ceased to exist in the meantime
A credible tax reform also includes a consistent fight against tax evasion
Tax evasion deprives the state and its citizens of billions of euros
Minimum taxation for more tax justice
By introducing minimum taxation, we will ensure that high-earning tax write-off artists will not be able to avoid taxation as they have done up to now:
To this end, the tax deductibility of losses is limited when calculating total income
Companies will not be affected by the new rules on loss compensation
In this respect, the deductibility of operating losses remains unchanged
Involve high private wealth in financing education
In the interests of fair burden sharing, we will ensure that even the very high private assets once again make a fair contribution to financing education and other public services
To this end, we will ensure that these very high private assets are taxed in accordance with the constitution We will,
however, continue to exempt the business assets of companies
By means of high tax allowances, we will ensure that normal earners are not affected by the private wealth tax
Normal single-family homes are not taxed: The planned tax-free allowance of, for example, 1 million marks for a family with two children is significantly higher than the taxable value of normal single-family homes
Reduction of social security contributions and ecological tax reform
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that social security contributions are reduced
Easing the burden on labor by reducing statutory non-wage labor costs is a cornerstone of our policy for new jobs
On the one hand, we will implement structural reforms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the social security systems
Secondly, we will reduce the tax burden through an ecological tax reform
Vote on tax reform
Although tax revenues have fallen sharply overall in recent years, the tax and contribution burden on average-earning employees has risen from 39 percent in 1982 to around 45 5 percent today
At the same time, the tax burden on corporate profits and assets has fallen considerably
This unjust tax policy must not be allowed to continue
The Bundestag election on September 27, 1998, is also a vote on tax reform: there will only be a fair and solid tax reform with an SPD-led federal government
Restructuring of public finances
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the shattered state finances are put back in order
This includes strict budget discipline
Our goal is to reduce the national debt
We must no longer live at the expense of future generations
That is why we must also be prepared today to reduce our demands on the state
The focus of our consolidation policy is to sustainably strengthen growth and employment: New jobs save on unemployment spending and improve the state's revenue situation
Our fiscal policy is based on consistency and predictability There
is no scope whatsoever for new credit-financed economic stimulus programs
Cash Review and Funding Reservation
We are placing our government program under a strict financing proviso
Immediately after taking over the government, we will conduct a cash audit
When we finally know the full truth about the state of public finances after the 16 years of financial chaos of the CDU, CSU and FDP, we will determine the exact priorities of our government work
But we are already saying openly and honestly: Not everything that would be desirable is also financeable
3 Completing Internal Unity: A New Chance for East Germany
The people of the former GDR fought for freedom and democracy in a peaceful revolution
In doing so, they paved the way for German unity
The unity of Germany has been achieved
The SPD-led federal government will focus all its efforts on completing the internal unification of Germany
German unity will only be complete once the social and economic divide between East and West has been overcome
People in East Germany want work so that they can finally take control of their own lives
Only then will the freedom for which the women and men in East Germany took to the streets in 1989 be achieved
In fact, however, unemployment in the new federal states is rising to new record levels in the eighth year after unification
Unemployment is around twice as high as in western Germany
For the SPD, the completion of Germany's internal unity is a top priority
That is why we will do everything we can to stop the rise in unemployment and get more people back into work
Future for Eastern Germany: Priority for New Work
The SPD-led federal government will place the creation of new competitive jobs at the center of its policy
We want a new opportunity for eastern Germany
The East Germans have already achieved considerable success in economic reconstruction: In urban development, in housing supply, in the expansion of infrastructure, in the rebuilding of the education system and universities
The most modern and productive car factory in Europe is located in East Germany
State-of-the-art aircraft engines are developed and built here
Top products in electronics, optics and wagon construction are manufactured here
State-of-the-art workplaces have been created in the chemical industry
An internationally competitive shipbuilding industry is emerging on the coast
All of this was achieved thanks to the reconstruction work of the people in East Germany and the reconstruction aid provided by the people in West Germany
The European Commission's structural policy was also indispensable here
The great motivation of East German women and men, their willingness to gain qualifications and further training,
the openness to setting up independent livelihoods, which proves all this:
It is mainly due to the policies of the CDU, CSU and FDP and the framework conditions they have set that the new federal states are still so far away from the goal of equal living conditions
Solidarity between West and East must not be broken off
The reconstruction of eastern Germany is a task for the whole of Germany that requires the solidarity of all in east and west
86 percent of the state financial equalization is used for economic reconstruction in the eastern German states
This shows: The demands of the CDU and CSU on state fiscal equalization call the reconstruction of East Germany into question
The Solidarity Pact of 1993 remains for us the financial backbone for the realization of German unity Solidarity
between West and East must not be terminated
The SPD-led federal government, together with the majority of the SPD-led states in the Bundesrat, will ensure that the solidarity-based aid for East Germany is continued
New opportunity for the new Länder: 10-point "Future East" program
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the new Länder are given a new chance
For us, the economic reconstruction of East Germany is a top priority task for the whole of Germany
The reconstruction of East Germany must be continued without any ifs and buts
We will implement a reconstruction program ''Future East''
This includes the following 10 action points:
1. reliable continuation of development aid and concentration of support policy on building up an industrial base:
Citizens, investors, federal states and municipalities in eastern Germany need clear and predictable framework conditions
The SPD-led federal government will draw up a long-term and reliable funding concept
In this way, we are replacing the short-sighted and unpredictable funding policy of the CDU, CSU and FDP
A competitive industrial base is the foundation for a self-sustaining economic cycle
This is why eastern Germany needs future-proof and competitive jobs in industrial production and production-related services
This is also the basis for the development of a modern service sector
We will simplify and bundle the investment promotion programs: The current funding jungle with more than half a thousand programs and over 700 individual measures must be thinned out
East German investors, generally small and medium-sized enterprises, must be advised on funding opportunities from a single source
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that national and European funding complement each other better
2. expansion of the East German research landscape:
Research and development have a key function in building an ultramodern and internationally competitive economic structure It
was therefore a serious mistake on the part of the Federal Government not to do anything about the fact that almost all industrial research has disappeared in recent years
What is needed is an innovation offensive that makes use of the qualifications and wealth of ideas of the people in eastern Germany
We will promote close cooperation between industry and the universities, technical colleges and research institutes in eastern Germany
3. active labor market policy and qualified training:
The SPD will no longer leave the unemployed to their fate
The SPD-led federal government will use the funds previously spent on unemployment benefits to finance meaningful work and training measures
Publicly subsidized employment will remain an important element of labor, social and structural policy in eastern Germany for the foreseeable future
The Social Democrat-led federal government will correct the cuts made in this area in recent years
A high-quality range of training places must be created for all young people
The provision of in-company training places has absolute priority
This is the only way to meet the skilled labor needs of the East German economy in the medium term
4. special program "Innovative SMEs":
Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of eastern Germany's economic strength
We will strengthen the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises
This includes above all: -Support for innovative start-ups
- Wage subsidies for new research personnel in small and medium-sized enterprises
- Support for joint research and development facilities of small and medium-sized enterprises and promotion of their cooperation with universities and research institutions
5. better capitalization of eastern German companies:
The SPD-led federal government will support the provision of private venture and opportunity capital to promote and stabilize small and medium-sized enterprises in particular
We will make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to go public
6. "Aftercare" for former Treuhand companies that run into difficulties despite sustainable products and structures:
In a joint action of the Federal Office for Special Tasks Arising from Unification (BvS) with investors, banks and the federal states, the competitiveness of the affected companies is to be achieved
The SPD-led federal government will ensure compliance with the contracts for the privatization of the former state-owned enterprises
Contract violations will be punished and contracts will be reversed if necessary, e.g. in the case of speculative sales
7. more effective organization of the East German foreign trade:
The SPD-led federal government will promote the sale of East German products and the recruitment of foreign investors
We will ensure that East German industry is represented with offices in all important foreign markets and can maintain information and service centers in the new states
This is part of an active foreign trade policy, which also involves using German embassies abroad to support the reconstruction of East Germany
8. employee participation in productive capital:
East German workers have a right to participate in productive capital and in the profits of companies
The reconstruction of the East, which is supported by workers' taxes, must not only lead to the accumulation of wealth for a few in the West
9. strengthened continuation of government infrastructure programs:
Public investment in modern infrastructure must be stepped up and brought forward in time
This primarily involves modernizing transport, expanding universities and research facilities, urban renewal, improving residential environments and expanding vocational training
Reconstruction East must not be allowed to become the federal finance minister's reserve fund from which to cover federal budget deficits
10. stable framework conditions for agriculture and rural areas:
We will work together with our European friends to ensure that Brussels does not make the wrong political decisions that would lead to the collapse of East German agriculture
The funding conditions - particularly at European level - must not disadvantage farms in eastern Germany
East German agriculture, which has emerged from restructuring in a competitive position, must be given secure prospects for the future
This also means that the existing regulations on land reform and the EALG (Entschädigungs- und Ausgleichsleistungsgesetz) will not be affected
This also applies to users of recreational properties and owner-occupied homes
Many of these measures are necessary throughout Germany, e.g. strengthening research and science, better support for business start-ups, strengthening active labor market policy and employee participation in productive capital
In view of the particular problems of eastern Germany, however, the SPD-led federal government will place a special focus on the new federal states
Wage policy is particularly important for the reconstruction of the East
An employment-oriented collective bargaining policy that takes account of the different performance levels of companies within the framework of regional collective agreements makes an important contribution to securing and creating jobs
We rely on the self-responsibility of the parties to collective agreements
Reconstruction of the East must finally be made a top priority
At present, there is an unnecessary fragmentation of responsibilities in reconstruction policy
Above all, there is a lack of an effective controlling instrument, i.e., a strong institution that continuously reviews the financial and legal instruments used for their effectiveness
In order to coordinate the measures of the various ministries and improve the effectiveness of the reconstruction concept, the SPD-led federal government will establish a central office "Future East" in the Chancellery with cabinet rank
The SPD will complete the inner unity of Germany
We want a Germany in which the people of East and West are no longer separated by a social divide
The policies of the CDU and FDP have failed
The SPD is the only party that can assert the justified interests of East German citizens with federal political strength
4 Social security and justice
A modern society needs a functioning welfare state
We know: Only those who have secure ground are willing to dare change and take risks
The modern welfare state offers this secure ground
It is a prerequisite for people's willingness to change
Only a society with reliable long-term security systems makes risks calculable and creates room for innovation The
goal of the modern welfare state is to encourage individual responsibility and initiative, not paternalism
We must constantly redefine the relationship between solidarity and individuality The
result must be new freedom for people The
market economy system and welfare state security complement each other: The market as a steering element for economic processes, the welfare state as a guarantor of a humane economy
Both together ensure the participation of all in the economic success of our country
Mass unemployment undermines the stability of social security systems: Due to the decreasing number of contributors and the increasing number of beneficiaries, unemployment is destroying the financial basis of the welfare state
With a policy for new jobs, the SPD-led federal government will ensure that the ratio of contributors to beneficiaries is brought back into balance
More and more people in the Federal Republic are poor In order
to be able to combat poverty effectively, the SPD-led federal government will present a national poverty and wealth report to the Bundestag
Work instead of welfare
Our principle is: "Work instead of welfare"
We want to ensure that people who are able to work and receive social assistance are offered a job, retraining or further training
We want to strengthen cooperation between social welfare offices and employment offices
Unemployed welfare recipients are to be encouraged to take up work through temporary, supplementary income subsidies (combined income)
In connection with these positive incentives, we will ensure that welfare recipients also accept jobs offered to them
If jobs offered are not accepted without good reason, the existing statutory provisions on the reduction of social assistance must be applied
In a community, there are not only rights, but also duties
Four strong pillars for old-age provision
Our goal is to maintain an affordable pension system that ensures people a decent standard of living in old age
We want to build the pension system of the future on four pillars: 1. Statutory pension insurance will remain the decisive pillar of old-age provision in the future
2. It must continue to ensure a decent standard of living in old age
3. Thesecond pillar is occupational pension provision
4. The third pillar is private provision, e.g. through home ownership and life insurance
5. As a new additional pillar of old-age provision, we want employees to participate more strongly in the capital stock of the national economy, in productive capital and in the profits of companies.
Solidarity between old and young: safeguarding pensions in the long term
Confidence in the security of pensions has been shaken The
reduction in the pension level from 70 percent to 64 percent decided by the CDU, CSU and FDP has also contributed to this
The reduction in the pension level would turn many pensioners into welfare recipients This is
particularly clear in the case of women's pensions, which average 900 marks a month
This is no way to treat people who have worked hard all their lives
The SPD-led federal government will correct the antisocial pension policy immediately after the Bundestag elections
It will ensure that the intergenerational contract between old and young is put back on a secure footing
We will also ensure that women receive independent retirement benefits
Safeguarding the pension - stabilizing contributions
To stabilize the pension system for the coming decades, we will implement the following structural reforms:
- Relief for the pension fund
The pension fund must be freed from non-contributory benefits that are not part of the basic compensatory elements of a social insurance system
These are benefits that are in the interest of all citizens, such as a successful Aufbau Ost (reconstruction of the East)
They are tasks for society as a whole and must therefore be financed not only by the contributors to the pension insurance system, but by everyone together
- Expansion of the group of insured persons
Fair financing also includes including bogus self-employed persons and previously uninsured self-employed persons in the pension insurance
We want to eliminate the abuse of marginal employment relationships
Our goal is socially secure jobs for all
By easing the burden on pension insurance and expanding the group of contributors, pension insurance contribution rates can be lowered and stabilized at a low level until well into the next century
- Extension of the working life
When there is a visible easing on the labor market, the actual working life can be adjusted to increasing life expectancy In
this way, we avoid active older people being sent into early retirement against their will
In this way, we also make a further contribution to stabilizing the pension system
- Pension fund
In order to cope with the demographic burden on pension insurance resulting from the changed age structure of the population in the years 2015 to 2030, a provident fund can be created for a limited period after the turn of the millennium
This provident fund can usefully supplement the existing pay-as-you-go system with a funded system The
situation on the labor market must also be taken into account for the provident fund
Our concept for long-term pension reform
In the past, changes in the economy and society have repeatedly necessitated adjustments to old-age security
The unmistakable changes in working life and in the family as well as demographic developments require - as already announced by the SPD in the pension reform of '92 - a renewed structural reform in the longer term, to secure pensions in the long term
In addition to the normal employment relationship on which the traditional pension system is based, there is an increasing amount of part-time work and more and more frequent alternation between phases of employment and inactivity, for example in the case of child-rearing, further qualification or temporary unemployment
There is also an increasing amount of gainful employment, In the
future, these broken employment histories will mean that more people will not have complete insurance histories
The failure to pay contributions jeopardizes the principle of a pension that guarantees a standard of living and the viability of the pay-as-you-go system
We are therefore striving for compulsory pension insurance for all employed persons In
the long term, compulsory insurance for all citizens should also be examined The
aim is to ensure that everyone has as complete an insurance history as possible and thus guarantee their old-age provision The
same applies to this reform: There will be no change to the defined contribution and defined benefit pension system
Health must be affordable for all
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that health remains affordable for all and that everyone has the same right to good medical care
Preventive health care and health promotion must be given a high priority
Stable health insurance premiums through more efficiency and more competition
We want to stop the increase in health insurance contributions and stabilize them permanently
We will implement structural reforms that - without compromising health care - bring more efficiency and more competition
We will set global savings targets ("global budget") to be worked out with the participation of those involved in the health care system
Our health policy concept also includes: -Strengthening the role of family doctors,
- Better cooperation between family doctors, specialists and hospitals,
- Sharing expensive medical technology,
- Greater cost awareness in hospitals, -
Prioritizing rehabilitation over early retirement and nursing care,
- Strengthening patients' rights We will
ensure that the health insurers' benefits catalog includes all medically necessary health services
To improve the quality of care and reduce costs, we will remove all medically questionable services and drugs from the health insurers' benefits catalog (positive list)
Do not overburden patients
We want full and solidary protection for all insured persons
We will review the existing co-payment regulations As
a first step, we will relieve chronically ill and elderly patients of co-payments We will
reintroduce the abolished health insurance benefits for dental prostheses for young people born after 1979
New directions in drug policy
We want to break new ground in drug policy We
will shape a drug policy in which help for addicts and preventive health care are at the forefront We
focus on prevention because we want to do everything we can to prevent people from falling into addiction through education and preventive help for those at risk
We focus on help because we know that addiction is a disease and requires treatment
We are declaring war on the drug mafia We
want to take the ground out from under drug crime: We want help instead of punishment for addicts,
but rigorous prosecution of drug dealers
Strengthen the rights of the disabled
The prohibition of discrimination against the disabled enshrined in the Basic Law must be enforced Disabled
fellow citizens need the protection and assistance of society as a whole
Our aim is to enable disabled people to lead self-determined lives
Disabled people must be able to participate in working life
Our society cannot afford to do without the qualifications and motivation of disabled fellow citizens
We will combine the tasks and services of rehabilitation in a separate book of the Social Security Code
Affordable housing and livable cities
We want more affordable housing and a better quality of life in our cities and communities
We will set new priorities in our housing policy: Cost-saving construction,
reduction of unnecessary subsidies,
promotion of cooperative forms of housing
and greater consideration of environmental protection and energy conservation
In order to create more affordable housing, the commitment of housing associations and private investors must also be strengthened
With a special program, we will address the specific social problems of large housing estates A
noticeable improvement in the housing situation is necessary, to give children and young people a feeling of security and to
increase the safety of citizens in these residential areas
We want a reliable and predictable tax framework for privately financed rental housing We will,
However, we will set an upper limit on tax incentives so that the vast majority of taxpayers no longer have to co-finance superfluous luxury buildings
By reducing luxury incentives, more funds can be mobilized for new construction and modernization of affordable housing
People-oriented cities
With new urban development funding, we will ensure that the living situation of people in their neighborhoods is improved
We want less traffic noise, fewer dangers for children playing, a healthy living environment and better traffic planning
We want lively centers and neighborhoods with good shopping, service, leisure and cultural offerings
More social housing
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the number of social housing units is increased again: We will increase the construction of new social housing
However, new instruments must also be used to utilize the existing housing stock in order to improve the supply of affordable housing
Defend social tenancy law - improve housing subsidies
The SPD-led federal government will defend social tenancy law against all attacks in the interests of the millions of tenants
We will reform housing subsidies and make them an accurate and family-friendly instrument of social housing policy
Managing immigration in a socially responsible manner
Germany is a cosmopolitan country
We want to promote the integration of foreign citizens living in Germany who are committed to our constitutional values
With their labor, their tax payments and their contribution to the social security system, they contribute to our prosperity and enrich our society socially and culturally
The core of a successful integration policy is the creation of a modern citizenship law
This means that children born in Germany to foreign citizens receive German citizenship at birth if their mother or father was born in Germany
Aliens law must be designed to be humane and socially responsible
Integration can only succeed if the limits of society's capacity and willingness to absorb are respected
That is why we want effective legal control and limitation of immigration
It must take into account the labor market situation, the efficiency of the social security systems and humanitarian aspects
Refugees and immigrants are different groups of people
Anyone who is politically persecuted is entitled to protection
5 Giving families a future again
The family should give people love, security, recognition and warmth
The family is one of the most important contributors to our society
It should guarantee the cohesion of people and the free development of individuals
It lays the foundation for the ability to take responsibility
We will do everything we can to make Germany a family- and child-friendly country again
Family is where the children are
That's why we want to legally recognize all permanent partnerships with children as families
Single parents deserve special support from society
Facilitate the decision "For children
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the economic and social situation of families improves noticeably
We will align employment policy, social policy, tax policy, women's and youth policy so that families in Germany have a future again
We want to make housing and living conditions family-friendly
The state cannot guarantee personal happiness and love between people
But it has to create conditions that enable families to cope with the vicissitudes of life
It must ensure that the decision to have children does not lead to an unbearable material burden for the parents
We are giving family support a new status
We want an appropriate equalization of family benefits in favour of families with children
We want to leave our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born an environment worth living in
Preserving the natural foundations of life is also a central focus of our family policy
Improvement of child benefit to 250 marks
The SPD-led federal government will raise child benefits for the 1st and 2nd child to 250 marks per month immediately after the Bundestag elections
Promoting living together with children must have priority
The family is also the focus of our tax policy
We will implement a tax reform that has one goal above all: To ease the burden on employees and families
Recognize family benefits in old-age security
We will ensure that the people who provide education, care and support in families receive an appropriate pension
Child rearing is one of the most important services for society
Therefore, the time spent rearing children must also be taken into account appropriately in parents' pensions
Policy for children and for the compatibility of family and career
We want to strengthen the financial power of the cities and municipalities so that a sufficient supply of daycare centers and all-day care can be created
In the new federal states, existing childcare facilities must be secured
We will develop the parental allowance into a parental allowance with realistic income limits
We will convert parental leave into parental leave with a parental leave account so that both parents have the opportunity to work part-time
The aim is to increase parental choice and create the conditions for raising children as partners
We also want to find ways to make parental leave attractive for fathers too
We want an active labor market and working time policy with family-friendly regulations
6 Women Forward - A New Dawn for Women's Policy
If our society is to master the challenges of the future, the intellectual potential, creativity and initiative of women must be allowed to develop to the full
Women's policy must be given new impetus
The SPD wants to make the equality of men and women once again a major social reform project
To this end, the political and cultural incrustations of the last 16 years must be overcome
We need new attitudes and behaviors in society in order to achieve a partnership between men and women
We want, every woman and man to be able to decide freely on their own life plan
The SPD-led federal government wants to ensure that neither women nor men are forced to choose between a career and a family
Women in eastern Germany in particular have had to experience in recent years that their professional qualifications and experience and their rights, which were once taken for granted, have been called into question
We want to give women in both east and west the opportunity to combine career and family and to increase their share of gainful employment
Action Program "Women and Work
The SPD-led federal government will launch a "Women and Work" action program: -With an Equal Opportunity Act, we will strive for equal participation of women in working life
- In active employment promotion, we will ensure equal participation of women -
We will support business start-ups by women to compensate for the disadvantage in start-up capital and borrowing
- With more flexible working hours and better conditions for part-time work, we must ensure a fairer distribution of gainful employment and family work between women and men
- More childcare facilities are needed to improve the compatibility of family and work; To this end, we will strengthen the financial power of the states and municipalities.
Equality in education and training
Girls and young women should be ensured access to future-oriented professions
Girls and young women should in principle receive half of all apprenticeships
We will improve the advancement of women in our university reform
Equal opportunities for women also include better compatibility of further education and family life
Independent old-age provision for women
We want independent pension provision for women
It must take account of the principle of equal sharing of jointly acquired rights
In this way, we are strengthening equal rights for men and women in marriage and partnerships
Protection of women from violence
Rape and sexual abuse are an attack on the right of women and girls to physical integrity and sexual self-determination
We want to prevent violence against women and girls - this includes effective punishment of the perpetrators
Women's shelters are an indispensable place of refuge for women who are threatened by domestic violence We
will promote these shelters We
want to ensure that in future the family home is left to the battered woman and the children and that the violent partner has to give way
§ 218 - Help instead of punishment
The SPD adheres to the broad social consensus on § 218: Instead of punishment for women, we rely on counseling and help
We want a child-friendly society in which the compatibility of work and children is possible for everyone
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the objectives of the Pregnancy and Family Assistance Act are implemented with all its strength
7 Youth needs a future - education for all
Young people are the future of society
Politics must open up opportunities for young people to lead a self-determined life
Educating our young people is the most important investment for the future of our country
Equal opportunities for girls and boys in education, work and society is a particular concern for us
The SPD-led federal government will do everything in its power to ensure that young people in Germany have a secure future
We want to provide every young person with a good education and vocational training,
- give all young people a chance of a qualified apprenticeship and a transition into working life,
- develop the universities into future workshops,
- secure social living spaces for children and young people,
- Dare to be more democratic and enable young people to participate more in politics
No young person should be sent from school into unemployment
New intergenerational contract with youth:
Education, labor, environment and social justice
Our society is facing important decisions about the political, economic and social future
These decisions affect young people in particular Young
people must be able to participate in these developments
We are concluding a "generation contract for the future" with young people
This includes the following measures: - Immediate program to reduce youth unemployment
This will be the very first measure taken by the new SPD-led federal government
With an immediate program to combat youth unemployment, we will ensure that 100,000 young unemployed people get into training and work as quickly as possible We
want all young people who have been unemployed for more than six months to be given a training place or a job
To finance the program, the funds that would otherwise have to be spent on paying for youth unemployment will be used
Our principle is: "Training and work instead of youth unemployment"
- Training offensive '99
The SPD-led federal government will ensure as early as next year that every young person has the chance of a qualified training place
This will require close cooperation with industry and with public administrations and companies Industry and the
public sector must take responsibility for ensuring a sufficient supply of training places
Otherwise, a fair, nationwide equalization of performance between training and non-training companies will be necessary on a statutory basis
Training advice in the chamber districts must be strengthened, Trainingconferences must be held at regional level and a regional consensus found on the creation of training places
Furthermore, training alliances should be promoted, inter-company and extra-company training centers modernized and additional training opportunities provided at vocational schools
Inter-company and extra-company training places are indispensable, particularly for eastern Germany and for structurally weak areas in the west
The intensification of vocational preparation at all school levels, the development of new occupational profiles and the modernization of training courses must be promoted
Training and continuing education must be more closely interlinked
- Fair working time regulation as an opportunity for career entry
By making working hours more flexible and reducing them, young people can be given the opportunity to enter working life
We will support corresponding agreements by the parties to collective bargaining agreements
- Just society - just future
Children have their own rights
Their human dignity must be protected
Children and young people should be educated to take responsibility for their own actions and social behavior
Young people want to be taken seriously
For this reason, their opportunities for participation in public opinion-forming and decision-making must be expanded
Young people want social justice
This also includes ensuring that the financing of future pension provision continues to be borne by young and old in a spirit of solidarity
Young people want the protection of the environment and life to be taken seriously at last
We want to phase out nuclear energy as quickly as possible
Foreign children and young people are part of the equation if we want to create a modern and cosmopolitan future
We will facilitate the social integration of our foreign fellow citizens
We will ensure that the youth associations in Germany can make their indispensable contribution to youth work
We want to promote and recognize volunteer work, especially in children's and youth work
We will enforce the equal treatment of military and civilian service
Equal opportunities in education
Education is the basis for personal development and a self-determined life
Our guiding principle is: education for all
This includes full equality of opportunity in access to higher education
Access to higher education must not be dependent on parents' wallets
We will ensure a BAföG reform with a needs-based training grant
Shortening study times can only succeed if students are provided with sufficient material study conditions
The SPD-led federal government will stop the downward slide in education funding
For the financial support of studies, we want to combine all education-related state benefits and use them in such a way that a parent-independent basic grant can be paid to all students during their regular studies, supplemented by additional support as required
We reject tuition fees
Modernize universities
We want higher education reform, together with all stakeholders
Universities should once again become places of scientific and social discourse
German universities need more autonomy and more performance competition among themselves
Streamlining and better organization of courses of study is also necessary
Research and teaching must be internationally oriented The
quality of teaching must be improved The
transfer of knowledge must be optimized
We also want more democratic co-determination rights at universities We want to
give young scientists a chance
and increase the proportion of women in teaching and research We want to
open up access to higher education for qualified professionals in all countries and
improve the promotion of further education and training
Education accompanies life
Continuing education is necessary
The foundation for this must be laid in initial education
Continuing education also has the value of being able to adapt qualifications with foresight
Continuing education must be expanded in view of the rapid increase in knowledge and rapid changes in qualification requirements A
uniform national framework must be created that ensures the diversity of providers and the quality of the offerings
We will strengthen political youth and adult education
Not least to combat right-wing extremism and violence, we need greater efforts in the area of youth welfare and youth associations
8 Seizing the opportunities of longer life - policies for older people
The desire to live long is coming true for more and more people in Germany
We want to ensure that the new opportunities of longer life are exploited
This "long life society" requires a rethink in politics, business and society
Harnessing the commitment and motivation of older people
Society as a whole can benefit from the life experience and commitment of older people
There is a high level of social, cultural, political, sporting and post-professional commitment among older people
We will increasingly promote this commitment
imparting knowledge, practical neighborly help and assistance for fellow human beings
We will support self-help networks, including those between young and old The
knowledge and experience of older people should be incorporated to a greater extent than hitherto when shaping democratic life
Include knowledge and experience of the elderly
Efficient and motivated older people should not be forced into retirement
Working lives must be made more flexible
In line with increasing life expectancy, it also makes sense to extend working lives on a voluntary basis
New life situations and lifestyles of older people open up opportunities for additional and new types of services and products
This also creates growth and new jobs
Secure pensions
The SPD-led federal government will ensure that the intergenerational contract between old and young is maintained
The reduction in pension levels decided by the CDU, CSU and FDP will turn many pensioners into welfare recipients
This is no way to treat people who have worked hard all their lives
The SPD-led federal government will immediately correct the pension law of the CDU, CSU and FDP
We will ensure the long-term stability of statutory pension insurance so that people have a decent standard of living in old age
We will also create the conditions for the statutory pension to be supplemented by private provision, company pensions and greater employee participation in productive capital
We want old people not to be dependent on social welfare: We will introduce a basic social security system which, if necessary, increases the pension in such a way that poverty in old age is prevented and the use of social welfare is avoided
This will also reduce the burden on cities and municipalities in terms of social welfare
We will reduce co-payments for medicines for older patients
A retirement in dignity and social security
We will do everything in our power to ensure that older people can continue to lead a life of dignity and social security
in old age The quality of nursing and care in old age must be constantly reviewed and further improved
We will improve the protection of older people against violence We
want to reduce the risks of age-specific diseases through additional research
The humanity of a society must also be demonstrated by ensuring that the old age is spent in dignity
9 Ecological modernization as the opportunity of the century for labor and the environment
We have a responsibility, not only for ourselves and our children, but also for future generations that have not yet been born
Our goal is sustainable social and environmentally compatible development
We support the demands that the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro made of the global community of nations ("Agenda 21")
We want a sustainable policy that combines economic, social and ecological goals on an equal footing
We want Germany and Europe to be pioneers in this area
Work and the environment belong together: Only jobs that are environmentally compatible are also sustainable
Energy and resource-saving technologies that protect nature are a key to prosperity and competitiveness
Ecological modernization: basic innovation for the prosperity of the 21st century
With the ecological modernization of our country, we are setting the course for new and secure jobs in the 21st century.
We want the German economy to take first place worldwide in the export of ideas, services and high-tech products for environmental protection and energy conservation
We want to build the bridge to the solar age We want the
German automotive industry to conquer the markets of the future with three-liter cars
We want to establish material cycles in industrial production and in the private use of products
With durable and repair-friendly products, which consist of largely reusable and recyclable parts and materials, there are great opportunities worldwide for new markets and better protection of the environment
The SPD-led German government will bundle support for ecological investments in the future at the highest possible level: -
Research, development and market introduction for new competitive and ecologically compatible processes and products
- New systems for more efficient and environmentally compatible traffic organization, measures to reduce CO2 emissions in traffic, expansion and modernization of local public transport, more efficient rail networks and the shift of traffic from road to rail and waterways
- sustainable energy supply systems, renewable energies, energy conservation
- ecological urban development and urban redevelopment -
ecological modernization and redevelopment of public infrastructure, especially in the transport sector, in wastewater and waste disposal and in utilities
Concerted Action Environment
Effective environmental protection is only possible together with industry and citizens
The SPD-led federal government will develop a national environmental plan together with the major social groups
We will focus more on setting environmental targets and timetables
We will develop these goals and timetables together with industry, trade unions, science and environmental associations as well as with the federal states and municipalities
Through voluntary commitments by industry and association agreements with verifiable and binding targets, we mobilize the innovative power of companies for more effective environmental protection
The agreement of concrete environmental goals and measures makes it possible to accelerate environmental procedures and to reach ecological investment decisions quickly
We want to improve animal welfare
Unbureaucratic and effective environmental law
Not all environmental issues can be solved by consensus or voluntary agreements
We continue to need effective regulatory law that ensures nature, water, soil and health protection
We will use an environmental code to make the confusing and overly bureaucratic environmental law more efficient and eliminate superfluous regulations We will
grant recognized environmental associations the right to take legal action throughout Germany, and we will revise environmental liability law We are
striving for greater harmonization of environmental regulations in the European Union
We want international agreements against environmental dumping
Harnessing market forces: Rewarding energy conservation and environmental protection
Environmental protection should pay off, environmental destruction must not pay off
This is the goal the SPD will pursue with an ecological tax reform
This reform consists of two parts: First: Relief of the production factor labor
Second: In return, a moderate and predictable burden on environmentally harmful energy consumption
The resulting funds are used exclusively to reduce the workload
steering effect of an ecological tax reform does not depend on the absolute amount of the individual burden steps
Rather, the predictability of the price trend and sufficient adjustment periods for the economy and for citizens are decisive for ecological success
With the SPD, there will be no excessive and unbearable burdens
Exempting process energy avoids burdening companies that compete internationally
The SPD's ecological tax reform is socially acceptable and a great economic opportunity
Our proposals are a first sensible step for Germany
On the way to more sustainable growth, harmonization in the EU is necessary as quickly as possible
Phasing out nuclear power - as quickly as possible
The SPD-led federal government will set the course for a secure energy supply without nuclear power
The SPD-led federal government will do everything in its power,to end the use of nuclear power as quickly as possible
Because of its major safety risks with the danger of incalculable damage, nuclear power is not justifiable In
addition, there is the unresolved disposal issue
The disposal of existing radioactive waste and facilities must be ensured
Reprocessing is too expensive and too dangerous
The correct disposal path is direct and regionally balanced final storage in safe geological formations
In the case of interim storage, priority is given to sites at the individual nuclear power plants
Building the bridge to the solar age
We want to build the bridge to the solar age
This is our vision for the 21st century
Renewable energies are to become a cornerstone of the energy supply
The share of renewable energies in the overall energy supply is to be gradually increased
This includes fair feed-in regulations for electricity from renewable energy sources
This applies both nationally and throughout Europe
Industrial mass production for modern solar technologies must be expanded
We will initiate a 100,000 roofs program and provide special support for the export of solar technology to developing countries
We also need an "efficiency revolution" in the use of conventional energies through the use of new technologies and combined heat and power generation
The SPD-led federal government will advocate the ecologically compatible continued use of domestic coal
Securing a supply base of domestic lignite and hard coal is essential in order to avoid excessive dependence on foreign energy imports
The coal policy decisions of the previous German government have forced the German mining regions to make extremely painful adjustments
We will provide regional policy support for structural change in order to give the affected regions new prospects for the future
10 The State as a Partner in a Free Civil Society
The modern democratic and social constitutional state should be the citizens' partner, not their guardian
In a democratic society, the state must give citizens as much freedom as possible
Its primary task is to safeguard fundamental and civil rights
Citizens and the economy need a state that is capable of acting
You have the right to expect that public tasks are performed in good quality and at reasonable prices
Without an efficient public infrastructure,
without an equitable education system,
without social security systems
and the modern society of the 21st century is inconceivable without an effective police force and judiciary
No one may be discriminated against as a gay or lesbian on the basis of origin, skin color, ethnicity, nationality or sexual identity
We want to protect minorities and achieve their equal rights and participation in society
Advancing reforms in the state and administration
In a world of change, the tasks of the state must also be reviewed
For the SPD, determining the tasks of the state is not a question of ideology, but of practical reason: Whether a task is performed by the state or by private individuals must be decided according to the principles of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, social compatibility and social acceptance
Public monopolies must not be transformed into private monopolies
Demands on the state must be scaled back
Many things that would be desirable can no longer be financed The
cost-effectiveness and accuracy of state services must be improved
The necessary social and cultural obligations of the state, however, must not be called into question
Over-regulation and over-bureaucratization must be reduced
The number of regulations, The number of regulationsthat burden citizens and the economy must be reduced
Existing laws and ordinances must be reviewed to determine whether they are necessary
We want an efficient state and a citizen-friendly administration
We want a qualitative reform of organizational structures and work processes
The development and implementation of reform concepts involves the cooperation of politically responsible administrative management, employees, staff representatives and trade unions
For a motivated and efficient public service
We want a motivated and efficient public service
The skills and motivation of employees must be promoted through modern personnel development concepts, improved qualification offers, management training, a further developed budget law, competencies shifted closer to decision-making and more personal responsibility
The importance of the civil service for the democratic constitutional state is undisputed
In accordance with their special legal status, the deployment of civil servants should be concentrated on the core area of sovereign state activity
This includes, in particular, the exercise of the state's monopoly on the use of force by the police and judiciary
Revive the idea of neighborhood
Many people have a growing desire to take responsibility for their own affairs
This is reflected in citizens' initiatives, neighborhood support groups, self-help groups and a wide range of social commitments
Social tasks can often be solved faster, better and more cost-effectively there
Where social tasks are accomplished through private initiative and the citizens' own commitment, the state no longer needs to intervene
The state should be a partner and create opportunities for people to take their problems into their own hands as far as possible
We want to revive the neighborhood concept
We want to give greater recognition and support to citizens' involvement in voluntary work and services
Promote sport
Sport makes an indispensable contribution to the active organization of leisure time, to preventive health care and to the social commitment of citizens The
care and promotion of sport is therefore the task of all areas of politics
The commitment of citizens in sports clubs is indispensable for our society
We will improve the financial framework conditions for sport
In doing so, we will focus just as much on mass sport as on top-class sport
More democratic participation rights for citizens
We want the introduction of referendums and plebiscites at the federal level
These new opportunities to participate in political decision-making are a response to the growing disenchantment with politics A
vibrant democracy needs the willingness of citizens to get involved and share responsibility
That is why we want a constitutional amendment to strengthen direct citizen participation
Strong cities and communities
Cities and municipalities are where people live and work, and where political decisions have a direct impact on citizens
We will strengthen the livelihoods of cities and municipalities and expand local self-government
Our goal is a clear and fair allocation of tasks and finances between the federal, state and local governments
Our democracy needs the interference of artists
We invite the artists and the critical intelligentsia of our country to get more involved again and to participate in the public discourse
The political standstill and the intellectual paralysis in Germany must be overcome
We need a new spirit of optimism that shakes off the intellectual mildew that has been lying over our country for far too many years
Our country needs the commitment of the artists
We want to improve the working and living conditions of the artists
This also includes the adaptation of copyright law to the new conditions of the digital age
Culture and the arts are indispensable
In keeping with our democratic tradition, we want to enable all citizens to participate equally in cultural life
Culture must not become an expensive pastime for the few
We will promote cultural pluralism and artistic creativity
Public cultural funding must ensure basic cultural provision and the diversity of the arts and preserve cultural heritage
Cultural diversity can develop best in federalism
We do not need a new federal responsibility in the cultural sector, but rather improved cooperation between the federal and state governments
Private cultural funding must be placed on an equal footing with funding for science and sport
We want young, non-established art to be supported from the proceeds of commercially successful art
We want to preserve memorials to the National Socialist reign of terror and the Stalinist-Communist dictatorship through a memorial concept
In a new media order, the cooperation between the federal and state governments must take into account the technical fusion of traditional media with communications technology
The media, telecommunications and cultural industries are increasingly becoming an important economic factor that creates new jobs
We want to take advantage of these opportunities
Preserving media diversity
We want a broadly diversified media landscape in which the press, private broadcasters and public broadcasters complement each other in a meaningful way
This ensures a comprehensive range of information, education and entertainment
CDU, CSU and FDP, however, want to cut off public broadcasting
We, on the other hand, say: Public radio and television are indispensable for our culture and for our democratic society
ARD and ZDF must not be broken up
We will ensure that public broadcasting's guarantee of existence and development is upheld
This also includes participation in new media services and technologies
We want strong internationally competitive private broadcasters
Germany must be strengthened as a production location for media companies
TV sports for all
Major sporting events, such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games, must continue to be broadcast live on TV in the future without additional fees
It must not come to a situation where soccer or the Olympics can soon only be seen on pay TV
Every soccer fan must be able to watch soccer unencrypted
11 Preserving Internal Peace - Strengthening Internal Security:
Resolutely against crime and against its causes
A democratic and social constitutional state includes the citizen's right to protection from crime and violence
Freedom and democracy need internal security for everyone, not just for those who can afford private security
The SPD-led federal government will use all political and legal means to protect its citizens: resolutely against crime and resolutely against its causes The
best crime policy is a good social policy
We will not stand idly by while right-wing extremists and violent criminals wreak havoc in Germany
We will fight them with all the means of our constitutional state
The punishment must follow the crime on the heel
We are in favor of fair and effective punishments: crime must not pay
The punishment must follow on the heels of the crime
The consistent and swift punishment of legal violations has a lasting preventive effect
Tackling the social causes of crime
Criminal law cannot eliminate the causes of crime
Targeted prevention is the best way to avoid crime
We will resolutely tackle the social causes of crime
That is why we want: -an effective fight against mass unemployment,
- the guarantee of social security,
- better assistance for families, -
an offensive for education and upbringing,
- fair participation of all in material prosperity and social opportunities.
Preventing juvenile delinquency - encouraging and challenging young people
The growing number of juvenile offenders is an alarming sign of the state of our society
To combat juvenile delinquency, we will first and foremost reduce the high youth unemployment rate and strengthen families' ability to raise children
We want to make more funds available for youth work, offer more integration opportunities and promote better youth cultural work
To combat juvenile delinquency, appropriate measures by the police and judiciary also remain necessary
Fighting organized crime - cross-border police and judicial cooperation
Organized crime must be fought, nationally and internationally
We will relentlessly pursue drug trafficking, arms trafficking and trafficking in women and children We
need effective cross-border police and judicial cooperation in Europe
We want to hit organized crime at its lifeblood, namely money
That is why we will resolutely enforce the fight against money laundering and the confiscation of illegally acquired assets
Punish criminals effectively - protect children
The protection of the general public against dangerous offenders must be strengthened
The sexual abuse of children is one of the worst crimes and must be severely punished
We must do everything humanly possible to protect our children against recidivists
During the penal system, attempts must be made to eliminate the danger posed by sex offenders by means of targeted therapy Sex
offenders must only be released if a danger to children can be ruled out
Punish everyday crime quickly and appropriately
We will not dispense with punishment for shoplifting, fare evasion and other acts of so-called petty and everyday crime
We want flexible punishments, without a great deal of bureaucracy, cost-effective and in accordance with the rule of law
Help victims
Victims of crime need help and support
We want the concerns of victims to be taken into account more strongly than before in court proceedings and in public, as well as in the punishment of offenders
Strengthen police
Police officers perform a service for the good of our entire society
We support the work of the police We
need well-trained police officers who perform their duties close to the citizens under reasonable working conditions
By strengthening the financial power of the federal states and through organizational reforms, we will ensure that more police officers can be deployed for the safety of the citizens
We want to increase the public presence of the police on streets and squares
Reform justice
We want to speed up court proceedings
They must become simpler and more transparent
The four-tier court structure must be transformed into a three-tier one An
effective and modern infrastructure at the courts is necessary
12 New Responsibility for a United Germany in Europe and the World
With an SPD-led federal government, Germany will remain a predictable and reliable partner for Europe and the world
We will pursue the unification of Europe with renewed vigor
The European Union is the best guarantor of peace,
Security
and social stability
The European policy and foreign policy of the SPD-led federal government are in the tradition of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt
In the spirit of the successful peace and détente policies of these two great Social Democratic Chancellors, we want Germany to become an engine of European and international cooperation
Only through ever closer European and international cooperation can the 21st century become a time of peace, social justice and ecological progress
Peace
and security are best achieved by promoting democracy and human rights and by creating sustainable prosperity
Our responsibility for European unification
Shaping Europe in the interest of the people
Modern government policy must have a European dimension: This is the only way to meet the new political and economic challenges
We want to secure and further develop the model of the European-style social constitutional state
The European model is based on freedom,
Democracy
and human rights,
on the rights of employees
and to the social and ecological market economy
Germany will assume the presidency of the EU in the first half of 1999
Together with our European friends and partners, the SPD-led Federal Government will drive forward the reform of the European Union
For a Europe of work and social justice
Work and justice must be placed at the top of the European agenda
Social democracy, as the strongest political force in Europe today, will ensure that there is a European employment pact
We want to anchor binding targets for reducing unemployment in the EU
We want to agree on a common goal in the EU: No young person should be sent into unemployment after school
We want European coordination of national economic and financial policies, in order to achieve more growth and employment in Europe
We want common and binding regulations against tax and social dumping
We urgently need European agreements on effective minimum taxation for companies and the elimination of tax havens
Europe needs future investments in a state-of-the-art cross-border infrastructure for transport and communications (trans-European networks)
Research and development must be bundled at European level and strengthened in the long term so that Europe can compete with the major economic powers of America and Asia
Euro for work and social stability
The European Economic and Monetary Union begins on January 1, 1999
Now it's about shaping them
The European Economic and Monetary Union offers an opportunity to shape the new conditions of globalization
The monetary union must be supported by a common economic and financial policy for all member states
The monetary union must be used to reduce mass unemployment in Europe: We want a euro for work and social stability
We want the euro to be just as hard as the German mark
Only if Europe succeeds in sustainably reducing mass unemployment can the euro secure the stability that people rightly expect and that we are striving for
For a Europe of the citizens
We want to bring the European Union closer to its citizens
There must be no overregulation and centralization
Only a Europe that strengthens the regions is a strong Europe
The SPD is committed to further reform of the EU institutions
The European Parliament, as the representative of European citizens, must have full co-decision rights
If the European Union is to remain capable of acting, majority decisions in the European Council must be extended
As an expression of freedom and common values, we want a Charter of European Fundamental Rights
We want to realize a common European refugee and asylum policy
The European Union must protect the health and safety of consumers.
and to attach greater importance to safeguarding the natural foundations of life
Continuing to build the European house with renewed vigor
The enlargement of the EU to the east has become possible thanks to the overcoming of the division of Europe
Enlargement to the east will promote democracy and a market economy and thus also increase our economic and political security
If the EU's eastward enlargement is to succeed, reforms in agricultural policy, structural policy, institutions and financing that have been put off for too long must be implemented in the EU
The SPD-led German government will campaign in the European Union for fairer contributions
We want a pan-European peace order
Together with all the countries of Eastern Europe and with Russia, we want to complete the construction of the European house
The SPD-led Federal Government will insist that the EU, the OSCE and NATO fulfill their pan-European tasks
Our responsibility to the international community
New world economic order with social and ecological market economy
Together with our European partners, we will campaign for a fair and internationally binding competition regime in international institutions such as the UN, OECD, WTO, ILO and G8:
We need minimum social and ecological standards to counter the exploitation of people and nature
We will work to ensure that exploitative child labor is outlawed worldwide
and that workers everywhere have the right to represent their interests through free trade unions
We want to prevent our economy from being threatened by unfair currency dumping
Our goal is a stable global monetary system
The European Monetary Union is a decisive step in this direction
Development cooperation for a world of solidarity
Out of human solidarity and a well-understood self-interest in peace and decent living conditions in all regions of the world, we want a sustainable development policy
We will support the developing countries' own efforts to build up their economic, social and democratic structures Development
cooperation should serve the fair reconciliation of interests between North and South
Sustainable development is a future task for all countries, but also for non-governmental organizations and the private sector, whose commitment we welcome
We want to reorganize German development policy It
must become a cross-cutting task oriented toward the goal of sustainability We must join
forces so that the causes of armed conflicts, environmental degradation and refugee movements can be effectively combated
The Bundeswehr serves peace and freedom
The soldiers of the Bundeswehr are citizens in uniform The Bundeswehr
performs an indispensable service for our society
By improving political leadership, we will ensure the good reputation of our Bundeswehr
The SPD will adhere to compulsory military service Compulsory military service
must not stand in the way of a reduction in Bundeswehr strength
If new developments make it necessary, a further shortening of compulsory military service or its suspension
The Bundeswehr is tasked with national and alliance defense and can only be deployed for peace missions, such as in Bosnia, within the framework of a UN or OSCE mandate
presence of the Bundeswehr in this region as part of the SFOR forces will have to continue for some time
The Social Democratic-led German government will take initiatives for further conventional disarmament in Europe
and for a worldwide reduction of weapons of mass destruction with the goal of their elimination We
will do everything we can to absorb structural problems in the regions particularly affected by disarmament through conversion measures
NATO is a central pillar of our security
NATO is indispensable for the security and stability of Europe
Within NATO, we strive for a partnership of equals between Europe and the United States
The process of NATO enlargement must not lead to the exclusion of Russia, must not bring about a new division of Europe in terms of security policy, must not beassociated with rearmament and must also lead to a stronger role for the OSCE
NATO is and remains a defense alliance
The global monopoly on the use of force to secure world peace lies exclusively with the United Nations
NATO operations that go beyond its collective defense mission require a mandate from the United Nations or the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
Strengthening the United Nations
The role of the United Nations in securing peace, developing the South and combating global environmental degradation must be strengthened
We support international efforts for UN reform
The SPD-led federal government will accept an invitation to appoint Germany as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, The
UN's blue-helmet missions have proven their worth as an instrument of peacekeeping in many crisis areas of the world The
German Bundestag must decide in each specific case whether the Bundeswehr should participate in the implementation of a UN mandate In order
to strengthen the UN's peacekeeping function, we support the provision of national troop contingents for blue-helmet missions
The SPD-led German government will make a special Bundeswehr contingent available to the United Nations for blue-helmet peacekeeping missions
SPD: Politics for the majority
This program shows the basic lines of our government policy for the next four years
This is the blueprint for a better and fairer Germany
SPD policy is policy for the vast majority of citizens
We want Germany to get back on track
The course has been set: There must be a change of policy in Germany at the Bundestag elections on September 27, 1998
The time for change is here
We are ready
