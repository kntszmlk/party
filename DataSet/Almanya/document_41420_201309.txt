Germany is on the right track.
Despite the severe crisis in Europe.
This is first and foremost thanks to the people who, through their joint efforts, have restored strong growth,
have created more jobs and higher wages in Germany.
And it's a credit to liberal policies because more people have the freedom to pursue their dreams and go their own way.
This is what we have been working for for four years in the Christian-Liberal coalition.
We have fought many a battle for this over the past four years.
And the results are impressive: It was four good years for Germany.
We have relieved the people in our country of a total of 22 billion euros.
We have put the state budget in order and adopted a structurally balanced federal budget for 2014 for the first time in over 40 years.
We have succeeded in introducing a debt brake in all euro countries and created the conditions for Europe to become a genuine stability union.
We defend the safety of our money.
We have prevented new subsidies and stopped state aid for large corporations.
We have additional investments in education,
in Research,
in infrastructure
and childcare.
And we have strengthened civil rights
and reduced bureaucracy.
So that everyone can develop freely.
A strong social market economy.
Safe money.
Solid budgets.
Relief for center.
More educational opportunities.
And strong, free citizens.
That was only possible with us.
That was only possible with the FDP.
We have cleared away obstacles and created free spaces.
Free spaces that have been used by the people in our country to create a German growth miracle in the midst of the European debt crisis:
While our neighbors all around are suffering from the crisis, we have created 1.6 million new jobs in Germany that are subject to social insurance contributions.
That's one new job every 80 seconds.
More people have jobs than ever before in history.
Wages are rising.
Our social security systems are once again on firm footing.
That is our joint success.
And we want to continue on this path together.
We know that this will not be easy.
But we also know what has made us strong in Germany:
People who work hard - out of passion, out of love for others, out of responsibility.
We believe in these people.
We want to further strengthen these people, the real growth forces of our country, so that the next four years in Germany will also be good ones.
We want to continue working for this:
- For the black zero in the federal budget.
- So that we can finally start paying down debt for the first time in 2016.
-
- For the abolition of the cold progression and the Solis as well as against new tax increases in order to further strengthen the people and thus the growth forces of our country.
- 
- For the independence of the ECB, for the strengthening of the Bundesbank, for compliance with the stability rules in Europe -
- and for a stable, secure currency.
- So that our upswing and your savings also remain secure.
- 
- For a diverse and free society. -
Through modern immigration law,
- the fundamental admission of dual citizenship
- and more citizen participation. -
For more investment in education,
- for a better work-life balance
- and for a future-oriented infrastructure policy.
- So that Germany remains strong.
- 
This is only possible with us.
This is only possible with the FDP.
And together we can achieve much more:
Full employment.
Debt freedom.
More prosperity for all.
These goals are within reach.
But to do that, we have to stay the course in Germany.
That's what this election is about.
We are not promising Germany a quick and easy path to a brave new world.
Our promise is a better state that creates freedom instead of constriction.
Our promise is that everyone should have the chance to realize their own dreams.
Our promise is that the upward mobility promise of the social market economy can become a reality for everyone in Germany.
You can only do that with us.
To this end, we are keeping Germany on course.
For this, we solicit your trust.
I. Growth so that everyone can move up
The freedom of the individual is the basis and limit of liberal politics.
That is why we create the conditions for every person in our country to be able to develop freely, overcome obstacles and be happy according to their own ideas.
We want to fulfill the upward mobility promise of the social market economy:
That every person in our country can achieve advancement through his or her own efforts.
In doing so, we are on the right track.
While Europe is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis, Germany has written a success story in recent years:
More people in work than ever before in history,
the best employment opportunities for young people throughout Europe,
a sound national budget,
Rising wages
and rising pensions.
We want to continue this success story together with the people in our country.
We therefore resolutely defend the social market economy against those who want to override the principles of our economic order, such as the model of the honorable merchant or liability for one's own actions and omissions.
And we defend and strengthen the social market economy against all others who rely on the state instead of trusting the people.
This is the crucial debate of the coming years.
We are strengthening the social market economy because it is the basis for prosperity, progress and growth in Germany - for each individual's pursuit of happiness.
That is why we are fighting for a stable currency.
Because we want to safeguard people's savings and retirement provisions.
That is why we are reorganizing our national budget and will start to reduce mountains of debt as quickly as possible so that we can also reduce interest payments - because we are thinking of our children and our children's children.
We are strengthening our small and medium-sized businesses because they are the backbone of our economy
and secure good, decent jobs for the people in our country.
And we relieve citizens, the self-employed and entrepreneurs of taxes and bureaucracy.
So that there is a little more time and money left at the end of the month - for your own home, your own provisions, your own dreams.
So that inventors, explorers, daredevils and creative people have the means and freedom to realize their ideas.
And thus move our country forward.
Together, we can succeed in moving Germany forward.
We can achieve great things:
A balanced federal budget,
full employment,
more prosperity
and more opportunities for all.
These goals are within reach.
To this end, we want to continue on our path together with the people of our country - the path of the social market economy.
The foundation for our prosperity - stable money
Stable money is a cornerstone of any free and fair social and economic order.
After all, inflation means the destruction of savings and the devaluation of one's own life's work.
The social market economy is therefore inconceivable without a consistent policy of monetary stability.
This is because monetary stability protects incomes and property.
Especially by people with small savings, low-income earners and pensioners.
Inflation is the greatest social injustice imaginable.
Monetary stability is the German raison d'Ãªtre.
The culture of stability is our dowry for Europe.
Our bitter historical experience is that if
the monetary system falls into disarray, there is a danger that society as a whole will fall into disarray - with unforeseeable political consequences.
Deeply seared into our collective memory is the hyperinflation of the 1920s and the demonetization of the immediate postwar period.
Some want to open all the money floodgates and inflate away debt to combat the debt crisis.
In addition to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Japanese central bank and the British central bank have extremely expanded their money supply.
Such a large amount of money increases the risk of inflation.
However, permanent government financing through the printing press is fundamentally wrong.
That would be the road to inflation union.
By contrast, we want to continue along the path of the social market economy: For stable money and secure savings.
This is what we stand up for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to get the national budget into the black and start paying off our debts as quickly as possible.
- We stand for solid, stable budgets and the repayment of our old debts.
- After all, less government debt is the best protection against inflation.
- By consistently working for more growth, we are strengthening the foundations of our prosperity in Germany and Europe.
- and create the basis for solid budgets and a stable currency.
- 
- We defend the independence of the ECB.
- The ECB must remain committed to monetary stability.
- We firmly reject government financing by the ECB and thus the restructuring of national budgets through inflation.
- 
- We want to strengthen the Bundesbank in the ECB Governing Council.
- Today, the Bundesbank has only one vote out of 17 on the ECB's Governing Council, even though Germany bears more than a quarter of the liability risk.
- This is not appropriate and should change.
- In the case of extraordinary decisions such as the purchase of government bonds, the Bundesbank and the other major central banks need a veto option.
- 
o We stand for a stability union with sound budgets and finances. o We will
not support a liability union.
o For political, legal and economic reasons, we Liberals reject joint and several liability for member states' government bonds, such as via Eurobonds or an old debt redemption fund.
o
o Instead, further structural reforms are indicated so that Europe can grow out of its debts under its own steam.
o Any form of emergency aid is a last resort if the stability of the euro area as a whole is at risk.
o 
- We want to include monetary value stability in the Basic Law.
- Monetary stability is crucial for the development of citizens' economic freedom.
- 
Out of responsibility for today and tomorrow - reducing mountains of debt
It is not up to today's generation to block the path of future generations with mountains of debt.
We have an obligation to the current generation to avoid paying interest.
Europe's debt crisis has shown us that: We have to stop - in Germany and in Europe - financing our standard of living today at the expense of the future.
Debt can act like drugs: it
creates a vicious circle that first leads to dependency and then ultimately poses an existential question for society and democracy.
The crisis in Europe teaches us that overtaxing the state actually destroys it.
Those who promise people ever higher state benefits are in fact cheating them out of their opportunities.
Those who think they are doing something good for the citizens by weakening a country's economic performance are in fact perverting the country's future.
We Liberals are ensuring that Germany and Europe respond properly to the current crisis:
More economic performance and less state.
This is the fundamental issue at stake in the 2013 Bundestag elections.
Based on this conviction, we have advocated a ban on debt
and the consolidation of the state budget.
That is why we were the first federal government ever to cut spending.
Additional revenues were used to reduce new debt.
At the same time, we have given cities and municipalities new financial leeway.
By assuming the costs of basic benefits for the elderly alone, we are relieving the burden on local authorities by four billion euros a year and giving them breathing room again.
Compared with the planning of the previous black-red government in 2009, we have more than halved new borrowing in recent years.
This means over 150 billion euros less debt than planned at the time.
As early as 2012, the federal government's new borrowing limit of 0.35 percent, which will apply from 2016, was not reached.
We have presented a structurally balanced draft budget for 2014.
These consolidation successes go beyond what even optimists would not have expected in 2009.
Whether this sound budgetary policy is continued or softened - that is what this federal election is all about.
Stable growth
and a sound budgetary policy - that is the way to reduce debt.
New government tasks may only be decided on if their financing is also secured in the long term.
A policy of complacency that promises today what will have to be paid for dearly tomorrow has led us into dependence on financial markets in the first place.
The ability to act of a budgetarily sound state also gives us the freedom to strengthen federalism,
more local self-government
and the introduction of a genuine principle of connexity.
That is why we want to start reducing the debt burden of the federal and state budgets immediately after even faster consolidation.
So that we do not squander our own freedom and opportunities - and those of our descendants.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to continue our course of budget consolidation and start reducing the mountain of debt as quickly as possible.
- 
- With a "new sustainability formula", the savings rule, we want to pave the way for an efficient and lasting restructuring of public finances.
- To this end, we want to ensure that real additional tax revenues generated from growth are used exclusively for debt reduction and investment.
- Only in this way can we make the project of a debt-free nation truly a generational project, independent of all day-to-day political conflicts and interests.
- 
- Direct aid may only be granted for a limited period of time and must, if possible, be linked to a fixed reduction path.
- A continuation of the subsidies requires a new resolution by Parliament. -
We want to continue to reduce subsidies
- and leverage efficiency and savings potential in public administration.
- 
- We want to introduce a subsidy brake for the federal budget.
- In this context, the total volume of financial assistance and tax concessions is to be determined in advance and separately from the federal budget, and gradually reduced.
- 
- Our goal is to further reduce the state share.
- The requirement to examine projects for privatization opportunities serves this purpose.
- 
- We Liberals are committed to not increasing the burden of taxes and duties on people and companies.
- 
- The goal of us Liberals remains to reduce the tax burden on citizens and entrepreneurs.
- In order to prevent creeping tax increases due to the so-called cold progression, the income tax rate must be adjusted regularly.
- 
- We want to anchor the principle of halving the tax burden in the Basic Law.
- After all, paying more than half of income to the state through income taxes is disproportionate and anti-performance.
- That is why, in addition to the debt brake, we also need a tax brake to protect citizens, so that other political majorities do not burden them excessively with taxes.
- 
- We want to comprehensively reorganize the financial relations between the federal government, the states and the municipalities.
- This project only has a chance of success if the federal government, the states and the municipalities tackle it together, in partnership and with determination, within the framework of a new Federalism Commission. - The
focus will be on reforming the federal-state fiscal equalization system in such a way that growth and thrift are rewarded rather than penalized, on
reducing duplication of responsibilities and mixed financing, on
expanding the financial autonomy of the states and on federal competition.
- Our goal is to make a stronger distinction between federal and state taxes. -
At the same time, we want to anchor a genuine principle of connexity in our constitution:
- Municipalities may only be entrusted with additional tasks by the federal or state governments if funding is guaranteed by the legislature.
- Finally, the following must apply: He who orders, pays.
- 
Relief for the ascent
We create opportunities by removing barriers and reducing burdens that make it difficult for people to advance.
That is why we Liberals are fighting resolutely against additional burdens on citizens and companies
- and for the reduction of bureaucracy,
for the simplification of the tax system
and for relief for citizens.
That is why we have relieved the burden on families in our country by 4.6 billion euros a year by increasing child benefits and the child allowance.
For a family of four, that means at least 480 euros more a year.
The gradual reduction in pension insurance contributions has brought further annual relief of eight billion euros.
We have improved the tax framework for small and medium-sized enterprises,
reduced the cost of bureaucracy in Germany by eleven billion euros
and lowered the government spending ratio from 48.1 to 45.2 percent.
The first steps toward simplifying tax law have been implemented, and we have increased the employee lump sum to 1,000 euros.
With our policies, we have created new freedom so that the people in our country can freely develop their strength and creativity.
Against great resistance, we have made their lives a little easier and reduced burdens.
We have strengthened the people and thus the growth forces in our country
- and thereby also created the conditions for a stable upswing and sustainable budget consolidation.
We want to continue to do that.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Our goal remains to ease the burden on the working middle class.
- We firmly reject a higher tax burden for citizens and companies.
- High tax rates do not automatically lead to higher government revenue, but prevent growth,
- destroy jobs and thus jeopardize the existence of countless employees and their families.
- 
- We reject the introduction of EU taxes.
- 
- We continue to see the need for a fundamental reform of income and corporate tax law.
- In doing so, we rely on a simple, low and fair tax system with moderate rates and few exceptions - ideally in a graduated tariff.
- Relief for the working middle and budget consolidation are not mutually exclusive.
- When it comes to budget consolidation, we are also focusing above all on task criticism and reducing expenditures.
- The state must not spend more than it takes in at any level.
- Government debt must not be built up, but reduced now.
- This goal remains a priority.
- 
- Our goal is to further reduce the state share in the sense of "private before state.
- That is why we will continue to examine which projects and tasks can be sensibly privatized in the future.
- 
- Regardless of the amount of tax, further simplifications to tax law save citizens and companies time and money.
- We want to set limits to the inventiveness of the tax authorities, which are constantly developing new reporting requirements and bureaucratic control systems at the expense of the middle class.
- In this context, we want in particular to introduce flat-rate regulations, raise flat rates, restore flat-rate regulations that have been abolished to the detriment of the middle class, and reduce reporting obligations and other bureaucracy.
- 
- We want to combat cold progression.
- Currently, people may have less in their pockets despite wage increases because the additional income is eaten up again by automatic tax increases and inflation.
- We therefore want to review the effects of cold progression every two years and adjust the income tax rate so that the state does not enrich itself from inflation at the expense of citizens.
- 
- The Solidarity Pact will expire in 2019.
- By that time, the reconstruction assistance for the east will be gradually phased out in full.
- We want to phase out the solidarity surcharge completely over the course of this legislative period.
- 
o Effort should be worthwhile.
o We therefore want to abolish tax class V, which often makes taking up employment unattractive from a tax perspective, especially for women after a family break.
o Families must be taxed fairly.
o The tax-free allowances for children should be gradually raised to the level of the tax-free allowances for adults.
o We want to retain the splitting of income between spouses.
o We are in favor of its extension to same-sex civil partnerships.
o Because the tax relief from splitting is in return for the responsibility of the spouses towards each other.
o This responsibility is paramount in relation to a spouse's entitlement to minimum social security from the state and the community of solidarity.
o Marriage splitting is thus an expression of both subsidiarity under social law and the priority of private responsibility over state redistribution.
o Corresponding obligations to assume responsibility exist not only between spouses, but also between life partners.
o They should therefore be treated in the same way as spouses.
- A stricter inheritance tax law as well as a wealth levy and a wealth tax would be an unbearable burden, especially for small and medium-sized companies, and would lead to a massive outflow of capital and wealth from Germany and destroy many jobs.
- We reject that.
- 
- We want to reform property tax law, abolish the current valuation law and give municipalities flexible assessment rates that can take into account local conditions and the type of use.
- This should not lead to an increase in property tax revenue.
- We want to transfer the trade tax to a municipal income and corporation tax system.
- A first step in this direction is the elimination of the current trade tax additions.
- The current non-income-based taxation of, for example, rents and interest effectively leads to a taxation of assets - and thus threatens the existence of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in economically difficult times.
- 
- The final withholding tax on investment income has proven its worth.
- It enables internationally coordinated capital taxation, prevents tax evasion and avoids control measures that are questionable under data protection law.
- By increasing the tax-free amounts for investment income from interest and dividends, we want to offer private households an incentive to provide for their old age.
- 
- We are committed to reviewing the system of excise taxes (for example, coffee tax) to see if it makes sense.
- The tax officials who may no longer be needed as a result can be deployed more sensibly to combat sales tax fraud.
- 
Strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, maintain industrial base, create jobs
The social market economy creates opportunities so that everyone in our country can develop freely.
We want to achieve full employment so that everyone has the chance to rise through their own efforts and improve their living conditions.
However, this requires a strong, dynamic and innovative economy that creates jobs and offers opportunities for entry and advancement.
That is why we want to further strengthen Germany as an industrial location and SMEs - the backbone of our economy - and promote the skilled trades as an economic factor.
That is why we are fighting against planned economy tendencies and against all steps towards uniform wages, uniform funds and uniform pensions.
Instead, we are relying on more competition
and the power of liberal regulatory policy.
Monopolies and cartels destroy the functioning of the market economy system.
That is why we Liberals are calling for a strengthening of competition law, including the possibility of unbundling.
This creates opportunities, prospects and a future.
The German economy, especially the strong SME sector, has led us out of the crisis faster than almost any other country in the world.
The commitment of family entrepreneurs, the self-employed and freelancers has secured millions of jobs and created new ones.
The fact that this was possible is also a credit to liberal economic policy.
We have decisively relieved companies in Germany of bureaucratic costs, eliminated regulations in corporate tax that exacerbate crises, and removed existence-threatening rules in inheritance law.
We have prevented interventions in the social market economy for the benefit of large corporations such as Opel, Karstadt and Schlecker.
We are committed to greater competitiveness
and a secure, affordable energy supply.
We resolutely opposed any attempt to weaken Germany's competitiveness and undermine the social market economy.
The freedom of our economic order also strengthens the international competitiveness of German companies.
To this end, we have fundamentally revised insolvency law,
freed microenterprises from unnecessary bureaucracy
, and made necessary adjustments to patents, cooperative law and consumer rights.
Together, we have created new entry and career opportunities for people in our country:
1.6 million new jobs subject to social insurance contributions since 2009 alone.
Employees, entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises deserve credit for successfully following this path.
It is the merit of people who make a new effort every day.
These people make us strong.
And we want to continue to make these people strong.
That is why we defend the social market economy.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to further develop and simplify inheritance and gift tax in a revenue-neutral manner.
- A uniform assessment basis based on market value, combined with moderate tax rates and appropriate allowances, avoids unnecessary bureaucracy, creates legal certainty in business succession and strengthens confidence in Germany as a business location.
- With every business succession, it must be possible to generate the inheritance tax from future earnings.
- We want to guarantee this through maximum limits and reasonable deferral rules.
- The old-fashioned graduated rate of inheritance tax, in which the next stage always applies from the first euro, should be replaced by a graduated rate in the usual form, according to which the rate of the next stage only applies from the start of the next stage.
- 
- We want to see a switch from the current debit taxation to actual taxation for VAT in order to safeguard the liquidity of small and medium-sized enterprises and make it much easier to prosecute VAT fraud.
- We want a fundamental, revenue-neutral reform of the value-added tax with the aim of achieving significant simplification.
- 
- Corporate taxation must be modernized in a growth-friendly way.
- To this end, we want to make it as neutral as possible in terms of legal form and financing and introduce transparent taxation for small and medium-sized limited liability companies.
- This would allow small and medium-sized limited liability companies to be taxed in the same way as partnerships.
- With regard to group taxation, we need a competitive group taxation law based on the Austrian model.
- Transformations within the group must not be subject to either income tax or real estate transfer tax.
- 
- In order to facilitate the formation of equity in partnerships assessed according to income tax, we want to implement a tax-reducing return on equity, as is already successfully realized in other European countries.
- All expenses incurred as a result of the business are to remain deductible to the same extent in the future.
- 
- We want to further improve the framework conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises in order to strengthen their competitiveness.
- Implementation of the new Basel capital and liquidity requirements (Basel III) must be SME-friendly, unbureaucratic and cost-saving.
- Otherwise, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises would become more difficult, even though SME loans have been proven to be low-risk due to personal liability.
- Together with the federal states, we want to strengthen financing for small and medium-sized enterprises and further raise the de minimis limit for regional funding.
- We will make the legal form of the cooperative more attractive for company founders, especially founders of social enterprises.
- 
- Reducing expensive and unnecessary bureaucracy must be a top political priority.
- For this reason, one ministry (for example, the Ministry of Economics) should be comprehensively responsible for this topic area in the future.
- This is the only way to give this issue a strong voice in the cabinet.
- 
- The shortage of skilled workers is acting as a brake on growth in many sectors, putting many jobs at risk. -
We are focusing on strengthening education, training and lifelong learning
- and on a flexible and family-friendly labor market.
- Securing skilled workers is a task for society as a whole. -
It starts with the trainability and motivation of young people and the reduction of the dropout rate in vocational training,
- goes on to the compatibility of family and career,
- to the use of the competence of senior citizens
- to a modern immigration law.
- 
- We intend to further strengthen the innovative power of German SMEs and industry.
- To this end, we support the development of technology and innovation clusters through targeted networking of universities, universities of applied sciences and research institutions with potential investors. -
We want to improve tax incentives for venture capital and business angels
- and intensify tax incentives for research and development within the scope of budgetary possibilities.
- Germany must offer young companies the opportunity to develop and must not lose touch with high technology.
- 
- The skilled trades need fair opportunities.
- This includes access to sources of funding and public contracts.
- The international competitiveness of the skilled crafts sector begins at home.
- That is why we want to improve local business conditions through a transport policy that is appropriate for the skilled trades,
- Effective recruitment of skilled workers
- and reduce bureaucracy, for example in the awarding of public contracts - we want to strengthen the skilled trades.
- 
- We want to further develop the Crafts Code and related laws in line with European regulations so that more people can offer their services without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, secure their own income, create jobs and pay taxes and social security contributions.
- 
- The future of Germany as a business location depends to a large extent on our strengthening - and not thwarting - the innovative power of industry and SMEs.
- We Liberals are committed to ensuring that new ideas and business areas are given a chance and are not nipped in the bud by bureaucracy.
- Start-ups in particular need freedom during the start-up phase - freedom from excessive bureaucratic requirements that eat up time and money.
- 
- The competitiveness and innovative strength of the new federal states must be further improved to enable self-sustaining growth after the Solidarity Pact expires in 2019.
- To this end, there must continue to be targeted support measures instead of scattergun distribution.
- We see the internationalization of the eastern German export industry as one of the main tasks of economic policy and promotion.
- Rising exports play a key role in securing economic growth and employment.
In view of the increase in economic activities by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) at national and international level, we are committed to introducing global standards to safeguard competition.
Driving a new era - affordable and secure energy
Growth creates new opportunities.
That is why we want to maintain the competitiveness of our economy.
The energy turnaround that has been agreed is an opportunity - but shaping it successfully is also a feat of strength.
It will only succeed if the outstanding decisions on slowing the rise in electricity prices, on better managing the expansion of renewables and on the framework conditions for the construction of new replacement power plants are now taken without delay.
A market-based approach should be adopted.
Germany can become a driving force for a new age.
But we must also be careful not to undermine the basis for the competitiveness of our economy and social cohesion.
That is why security of supply
and affordability
just as important as rapid progress in environmental protection.
We Liberals will make the energy transition a success with commitment, a sense of proportion and realism.
Energy must remain affordable for all citizens, small and medium-sized businesses, trades and industry.
We will not allow energy prices to become a social issue.
Every euro paid too much by people for energy is missing for them to realize their own dreams and goals.
Every euro paid too much by the economy for energy makes life more expensive and endangers jobs.
That is why we want to regularly review and, if necessary, adjust the timing and steering effect of all funding measures.
In the long term, economically viable and environmentally and climate compatible opportunities for a clean, secure and affordable energy supply should be exploited without ideological blinkers.
Because we want affordability and security of supply, we have created the necessary financial framework for the accelerated energy transition and revised the law on grid expansion.
In doing so, we ensure the accelerated expansion of the energy networks with the simultaneous participation of citizens.
We have new programs for energy-efficient building refurbishment,
for the research and development of renewable energies and new storage technologies.
In addition, we have already pushed through more competition in the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) - and are continuing to work on eliminating the expensive over-subsidization imposed by the Red-Greens.
We want more market and out of the planned economy.
The setting of electricity prices by politicians must not be a permanent state of affairs.
We support the introduction of an electricity price brake to prevent electricity prices from rising again on January 1, 2014.
New renewable energy installations and beneficiary companies must make an appropriate contribution to stabilizing the EEG surcharge that can be realized in the short term.
We have ensured that interference with legally effective funding commitments is not part of the proposal.
Liberal energy policy ensures that the energy supply is secure,
clean
and remains affordable.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- The state must not get rich from rising energy costs.
- As an immediately effective measure, the electricity tax is to be reduced to the minimum level stipulated by the EU.
- The federal states must also participate in returning the additional revenue to the taxpayer.
- In the next legislative period, we want to launch a new initiative to reduce the tax burden on citizens for energy-efficient building refurbishment, which will then be jointly supported by the federal and state governments.
- 
- In order to make the entire energy market more market-based, a swift and fundamental reform of the EEG is required.
- To this end, we presented a reform concept during the last legislative period.
- Renewable energies are to be introduced to the market faster and more consistently than before.
- Our aim is for renewable energies to be on the market by the time the last nuclear power plant in Germany has been shut down at the latest.
- We Liberals stand for legal certainty and protection of confidence in investments made.
- All reform proposals therefore relate only to new plants.
- In the further development of the subsidy system, we will take particular account of the financing options available to small and medium-sized enterprises.
- 
- A clear step-by-step plan is to be developed, according to which all plant sizes and technologies are to switch from fixed feed-in tariffs to direct marketing quickly and in a plannable manner.
- Suitable concepts are needed to relieve smaller plants of the administrative burden of direct marketing.
- At the same time, the direct marketing instruments for renewable energies are to be further developed.
- The current EEG market premium should be replaced by a market surcharge on the exchange price.
- It should be degressive and differentiate according to technology, but no longer according to plant size.
- 
- Feed-in tariffs and market surcharges are to be subject to a significantly higher tariff reduction per year for new installations for all technologies.
- The future expansion of renewable energies is to take place more evenly and without overheating.
- The "breathing cap" as an automatic adjustment mechanism is therefore to be extended from photovoltaics to all technologies.
- If a technology reaches the expansion targets, the support from the EEG is to be terminated.
- Exceptions are only conceivable for plants that perform important tasks beyond energy production.
- 
- We Liberals are in favor of decisively advancing the EU's internal market for renewable energies as well.
- We aim for a guaranteed minimum share of renewable energies in the entire internal market.
- The introduction of a European support model - also in the form of a quantity model - is possible by a majority decision of the member states.
- If a European solution cannot be implemented in the foreseeable future, Germany, for its part, should swiftly implement a national quantity model.
- 
- Exemptions from the EEG surcharge and electricity tax for energy-intensive manufacturing companies that compete internationally are essential to safeguarding employment and economic growth in Germany as an industrial location.
- Otherwise, there is a risk of job losses due to industrial migration.
- It was also right to put industrial SMEs on an equal footing with large industrial groups.
- However, the most important goal is to limit the costs of the energy transition as a whole.
- Companies that are not in international competition should not be favored, as this would inappropriately increase the levy for private households and SMEs.
- 
o We strongly support the development of a partnership in the field of renewable energies with North Africa.
o The Union's Solar Plan for the Mediterranean and the DESERTEC project can make a long-term contribution to the diversification of the energy supply and to the stability of the electricity supply.
o As a first step, we will continue to support the construction of solar thermal power plants in North Africa as part of development cooperation.
o In a second step, we want to create legal certainty for market access for solar and wind power from North Africa to the EU - if possible within the framework of a European volume model.
o Legal certainty must also be created for the construction of transit lines in early cooperation with the countries concerned.
o 
- With the introduction of a nationally coordinated network development plan, the basis for an offshore network development plan and numerous legal provisions for accelerating planning and approval procedures, we have made essential provisions for accelerating network expansion.
- Now it is important that the expansion projects are implemented quickly by the network operators.
- The federal states also have a duty to make full use of the existing instruments for speedy implementation.
- 
- Decentralization offers the opportunity to strengthen competition and open up energy markets for small and medium-sized enterprises.
- We support the further development of supply networks into intelligent networks (smart grids) that actively respond to different energy demands and thus increase the efficiency of the energy used in the network.
- 
- The Federal Network Agency should immediately be given the option of overriding the feed-in priority for new large-scale plants on a regional basis and for a limited period in the event of unstable grid conditions.
- This will create an incentive to build large-scale plants in line with regional demand.
- Otherwise, the feed-in priority must be maintained in order to give small suppliers a fair chance and to maintain the pressure on grid operators to expand the grid.
- 
- Not only kilowatt hours, but also the provision of power is to be rewarded.
- The regulation of the power grid should enable such market models to stabilize the power grid.
- However, these should take into account the interests of consumers in their design.
- We therefore call for clear and reliable framework conditions for investments in reserve and replacement power plants, as has already been initiated with the amendment of the Energy Industry Act.
- This requires the introduction of an incentive system at federal level and, in the medium term, a new, market-based subsidy and market design.
- This is the only way to end the current reluctance to invest and ensure supply security at peak load times in the long term.
- 
- We want to take advantage of the opportunities for energy storage.
- That's why we support good framework conditions for deployable and efficient storage options, for example for power-to-gas models, pumped-storage power plants or the short-term storage of electricity using battery technology or other deployable efficient storage options.
- 
- We want to secure and improve the supply of natural gas in Germany. -
In addition to new pipelines that make us less dependent on gas imports from just one country and better access to the supply chain for liquefied gas - using the existing domestic gas network
- - we want greater competition on the gas market - in Germany and Europe.
- 
- The energy concept must not be implemented only in isolation in the electricity sector; a reform of the Renewable Heat Act is overdue.
- We need a clear perspective for owners and the trades.
- We want to introduce a quantity model that obliges wholesalers of oil and gas to bring a certain proportion of renewable heat onto the market.
- They can provide this target themselves by feeding in biogas.
- Alternatively, they can purchase proof of heat quantities from certified plants of other technologies.
- We reject regulatory legislation that obliges every owner of existing buildings to use renewable heat, as well as compulsory renovations.
- 
- A sustainable energy market also includes increasing energy efficiency in all areas.
- The incentives for this should first and foremost come from the market.
- We also want to exploit energy efficiency potential in industry by providing more intensive advice and transferring know-how to companies.
- We will place a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.
- The rate of renovation in existing buildings should be increased significantly to improve energy efficiency.
- This is to be supported by political framework conditions.
- 
- The implementation of the EU's Energy Efficiency Directive into German law should follow the principle of "incentive rather than compulsion".
- All measures must leave the individual citizen and the individual company as much scope for decision-making as possible, and existing measures must be fully credited against the European requirements.
- We Liberals reject paternalistic measures such as bans on incandescent light bulbs or mushroom heaters.
- Anyone who buys energy should have an incentive to save, but should not be told how to use energy.
- 
- The extraction of shale gas through fracking is an opportunity that can contribute to the success of the energy transition. -
However, it will only be usable in a densely populated country like Germany if social acceptance
- and the highest environmental standards are guaranteed.
- This requires a proper and responsible legal framework.
- The substances used and processed must not pose any toxic hazards.
- Above all, there must be no risk to groundwater or drinking water.
- To this end, the water authorities should be given a comprehensive veto right.
- We want to rule out fracking in water protection areas as a matter of principle.
- 
- We are committed to ensuring that, in the future, all responsibilities and federal tasks related to energy production and supply are bundled in central coordination of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). -
This should ensure the smoothest possible planning, monitoring and management of the energy transition process
- as well as maximum market-based solutions.
- The success of the energy turnaround is crucial for the future of the German economy and the cost burden on consumers, trades, commerce and industry.
- Energy policy is an indispensable component of economic policy.
- Responsibility for it should therefore lie with the ministry responsible.
- 
Regulatory policy for the 21st century - new rules for financial markets
In a social market economy, an efficient and stable financial system is indispensable for an innovative and successful economy, reliable old-age provision for people and the financing of the public sector.
It ensures demand- and risk-appropriate access to finance, thus providing scope for investment and sustainable forms of financial investment.
A functioning financial system thus serves the progress and growth of the economy and society.
For this, we need free
but not disorderly financial markets.
Wrong decisions in central banks, supervisory authorities, rating agencies and financial institutions have contributed significantly to this disorder.
The past years have shown: We need a combative and defensible social market economy - a new regulatory policy for the financial markets of the 21st century.
They should once again become an instrument for growth and progress that serves mankind.
The German universal banking system with its three pillars - private banks, cooperative institutions and savings banks - has proven its worth, especially in the crisis, because universal banks can spread their risks across several asset classes and therefore have more opportunities to generate liquidity in the crisis than specialized banks.
We want to strengthen this system and, where there have been undesirable developments, take corrective action through new regulatory law.
In Germany, we have led the way.
With a bank insolvency law for systemically important banks, we have brought risk and liability back together.
Now there must be a similar regulation at European level quickly.
We have improved the control of rating agencies and strengthened banking supervision.
It is given stronger rights of intervention when banks are in a crisis situation.
And with the newly introduced bank levy, banks will be held liable for the first time for the costs of dealing with a financial crisis.
We have learned the lessons of the financial and economic crisis and have already tackled many issues to strengthen the social market economy.
The main measures to stabilize the markets have been initiated or are being gradually introduced.
However, the reorganization of the financial markets is not yet complete.
Germany needs a long-term perspective as a financial and financing location.
We want to equip the financial system even better against crises.
This requires clear rules and plannable framework conditions.
This also includes the problem of systemic relevance "too big to fail".
Opportunities and risks must be in a healthy balance.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Global business requires global financial markets.
- A sustainable reform of the regulatory framework in the banking sector and on the financial markets as a whole is needed in order to avert risks to the economy and economic development and to enable social stability.
- In order to ensure effective state control, strict international rules are required on the one hand
- and, on the other hand, nationally and internationally competitive institutions that can fulfill their important financing function.
- This includes effective risk buffers and risk management systems for all market participants, including trading systems.
- In addition, there are transparent processes and risks, clear responsibilities and liability rules and effective controls.
- Beyond all the rules and controls, however, the most important thing is that risk and liability are brought together again.
- Privately assumed risks must also be borne privately.
- This is the best risk protection for everyone.
- 
- The purchase of government bonds by banks within the euro area should be backed by equity capital in a similar way to corporate loans.
- 
- We want to further improve supervision of banks and other financial institutions.
- But we don't want to simply enlarge supervisory authorities and increase bureaucracy in the banks.
- We need a critical reflection on why, throughout the financial crisis, banking supervision failed so dramatically despite several thousand employees and millions of petty checks.
- Not a single bank failure was uncovered by supervision.
- We do not necessarily need more supervision, but better supervision in any case.
- In implementing the common European banking supervision, we attach strict importance to a strict institutional separation between central banking and supervisory functions.
- This includes not only organizational separation, but above all the establishment of independent decision-making bodies in the supervisory pillar.
- Systemically important banks are to be controlled by a common European supervisory authority.
- Access to other banks should be possible if national supervision in the member state concerned is not sufficient to avert systemic risks.
- 
- We welcome the location of banking supervision at the ECB's headquarters in Frankfurt am Main and are committed to ensuring that the common European banking supervision meets the highest legal standards.
- Unification must not lead to a softening of the rules.
- At the same time, competition between different banking systems and different business models must be preserved, as must regional or cross-border sector structures.
- This includes in particular the systems of savings banks, cooperative banks and building societies that have proven themselves in Germany.
- 
- We reject access to national deposit guarantee funds or the national restructuring fund.
- German savers should not have to bear the financial risk of other banking systems with their money.
- Rescue and capitalization measures for banks from the European rescue funds are only permissible if the country in which the banks are domiciled is also jointly liable.
- 
- We do not want companies to become systemically relevant.
- When approving mergers and acquisitions in the financial sector, care should therefore be taken in future to ensure that no systemic risks are created as a result.
- 
- In order to restore the stability and competitiveness of the banking sector in Germany in the long term, the crisis-ridden Landesbanken in particular must restore their business model and balance sheet to a level commensurate with their public mandate.
- All shareholders must be held jointly responsible for the risks they have taken, including the savings banks if they have held shares.
- The state should gradually withdraw from these banks.
- Further subsidies at the expense of private competitors or even greater burdens on the taxpayer with the risks of the institutions already supported, especially in the rescue of Landesbanken, are unacceptable and damage the location as a whole.
- 
- Alongside the banking system, the capital market is an important component for financing our future and retirement provision.
- Here, too, we want to continue working on a crisis-proof and future-proof framework.
- This also includes venture capital and private equity.
- Germany owes its strong position in international competition not only to innovation, but also to confidence in investments and production made in Germany.
- 
- New taxes cannot close the supervisory and regulatory gaps in the financial markets.
- We are against tax models that create bureaucracy, cannot be levied effectively - and end up hitting the wrong people: businesses, savers and citizens who make provisions for their old age.
- 
- We want to strengthen shareholders' rights to their company.
- They are the owners.
- Managers are their stewards.
- This relationship must be reflected more strongly in shareholders' rights - also to promote sustainable investment decisions that are responsible from a risk perspective.
- For this reason, we want to strengthen the influence of the Annual General Meeting on management compensation, for example, by making compensation for Executive Board members above certain limits and amounts subject to shareholder approval.
- We reject any encroachment on owners' and shareholders' rights - for example by specifying certain quotas for appointments to supervisory positions.
- 
Preserving regional diversity, exploiting demographic opportunities, strengthening rural areas
We want people everywhere in Germany to have the chance to make their own way - whether in cities or rural areas.
Germany is a diverse country, a country of regions.
Half of all people in our country live in rural areas.
A corporate culture that is often strongly influenced by small and medium-sized enterprises creates jobs, innovation and progress - often with effects far beyond the region:
Many world market leaders come from rural areas.
A modern agricultural and food industry is also of particular importance, as is an attractive tourist offer in many regions.
We want to shape demographic change and turn it into an opportunity.
To this end, all options for everyday life must also be available and easily accessible in rural areas in the future.
This includes securing care for older people in all areas of life,
but also future prospects for younger people.
That is why we have launched a comprehensive package of measures to strengthen rural areas
and, with the Rural Doctors Act, have taken an important step toward ensuring good, nationwide medical care in the future as well.
The strengths and diversity of the German regions must be preserved and strengthened.
The preservation of jobs is of central importance in this context.
That is why we are committed to a strong middle class
and an independent, entrepreneurial agricultural and food industry.
That is why we have permanently reduced the taxation of agricultural diesel and multi-peril insurance.
And with the passage of the Animal Welfare Act, the Animal Health Act and a law to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, we have brought animal welfare in line with economic efficiency in farm animal husbandry.
We have reformed the Forest Act in a forward-looking way and adopted a national forest strategy.
We stand for modern, entrepreneurial and sustainable agriculture.
We stand for diversity in rural areas and we stand for opportunities for the future and perspective for all people.
Everywhere in Germany.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to break new ground in order to maintain equal living conditions in all regions of Germany
- and preserve the diversity of the regions.
- To this end, we are strengthening municipal centers in which social and technical infrastructure can be provided cost-effectively and centrally accessible.
- As far as possible, people should be free to decide where and how they want to live at any age and in any situation.
- This requires appropriate framework conditions:
- In the transportation infrastructure, in the social infrastructure and in the communications infrastructure.
- We want to improve all three areas of infrastructure, for example by promoting technical assistance systems and other telemedicine applications.
- This is why a rapid, nationwide expansion of broadband communication is urgently needed.
- We also want to strengthen outpatient care services in order to ensure that elderly people in particular receive comprehensive care.
- In old age, we want to make it easier for people to stay in their own four walls, and technical assistance systems such as the home emergency call system help with this.
- In addition, accessibility must become part of the training and further education content of architects, craftsmen, planners and engineers.
- 
o We want to ensure affordable mobility in rural areas in the future as well.
o Motorized private transport is indispensable for many people here.
o We therefore reject an increase in costs through higher taxes or the abolition of the commuter allowance.
o We support the maintenance and, where necessary, the expansion of the corresponding infrastructure.
o 
- We want to further improve the framework conditions for conventional and organic farming through market-based reforms so that farmers can compete successfully in the market. -
That is why liberal agricultural policy supports farmers in their entrepreneurial freedom
- and advocates a level playing field within the EU.
- For viticulture, we welcome the implementation of a uniform European vineyard management system after the expiry of the previous regulation.
- 
- We stand for practice-oriented agricultural research and improved knowledge transfer.
- Reducing the impact on nature, raising standards in livestock farming and increasing the use of renewable raw materials require more research.
- Increasing efficiency is in the interest of sustainability.
- 
- We are committed to the responsible use and further research of modern biotechnology.
- The safety of the breeding method has been proven in decades of practice and has been confirmed by extensive risk research.
- The use of varieties approved by the EU after careful, scientific testing must also be possible in Germany.
- 
- The anchoring of animal protection in the Basic Law is a great success for us.
- We are committed to animal welfare and animal nutrition that promotes animal health.
- We want to advance animal welfare in farm animal husbandry at European level on a scientific basis and in harmony with economic efficiency.
- Plant-pollinating insects must be protected because they also ensure the yield of crops.
- 
- In the case of bioenergy, we take care to reduce competition between the tank and the plate.
- Further expansion of bioenergy should increasingly be achieved through the use of residual and co-products.
- In the production of biomass for energy use, alternatives to corn cultivation, such as short-rotation plantations, are to be used.
- 
- We are committed to sustainable forest management that takes into account the requirements of material and energetic wood utilization as well as biodiversity in silviculture.
- The aim of the impact compensation regulation of the Federal Nature Conservation Act should be the protection of nature, not the reduction of agricultural and forestry land. -
Restrictions on use are to be reduced to the bare minimum;
- We reject expropriation.
- 
- Trust is the most valuable capital, also for the agricultural and food industry.
- That is why we want to create more transparency, security and thus trust between producers and customers.
- We want to provide consumers with the information they need to make free and informed decisions about what to buy and what to eat.
- That is why we want consistent process labeling for all foods and consumer goods in whose production genetically modified organisms are involved at any stage.
- Only in this way is it possible to fully inform the consumer.
- 
Growing together - acting freely
Where more people have the opportunity to go their own way and pursue their own goals, it is possible to achieve more together and grow together.
Globalization creates enormous opportunities for this.
The world can greatly benefit from further cooperation.
To achieve this, it is necessary to remove obstacles and create free space.
As an export nation, Germany depends on this freedom in trade.
We reject restrictions on German exports or sanctions because of our foreign trade surpluses.
We will only be able to survive in a globalized world, in competition with countries like China, India and Brazil, if we become stronger together in Europe - and not by weakening ourselves.
Free trade also helps in the fight against poverty worldwide.
Because together we should seize these opportunities, we continue to advocate for substantial impetus to further liberalize trade and remove barriers.
For open markets.
For mutual benefit.
This is how we create the breeding ground for growth and prosperity worldwide.
For giving everyone the chance to learn more and achieve more.
For us to become better together and live better.
In Germany and around the world.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
o We want growth and prosperity worldwide through free trade.
o We therefore rely on the free movement of goods and services in the EU and a further opening of the global economy.
o We set high standards for human rights, occupational safety, consumer protection, environmental protection and health.
o We want to promote free trade worldwide and systematically dismantle trade barriers of all kinds.
o Free trade secures progress, jobs and growth, promotes the exchange of cultures and creates peace.
o A rapid conclusion of the current Doha Round in the World Trade Organization would therefore be a major step forward for everyone.
o However, as long as the negotiations do not make progress, the opportunity to conclude bilateral free trade agreements with other economic powers must be seized.
o We Liberals therefore support the EU negotiations with India, Mercosur and Japan.
o We will drive forward the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the EU and the USA.
o 
- We want to increase the export opportunities of German industry by opening up new emerging markets.
- These include, in particular, countries that have so far received less attention in terms of economic policy and business.
- All these countries have large domestic markets and are developing very dynamically.
- We want to build on the German government's successful foreign trade offensive, which has realigned and bundled foreign trade policy and its instruments.
- The aim is to strengthen German companies' interest in these countries and provide them with active support.
- 
- The German economy needs raw materials to continue on its successful course and thus secure growth and jobs in Germany.
- Access to raw materials depends not only on technological possibilities, but also on the economic and political framework conditions.
- We therefore want to conclude further raw materials partnerships with countries and at the same time reduce trade barriers and distortions of competition.
- 
- At the same time, we want to continue to support the economy through targeted programs in the diversification of raw material sources, exploration and mining activities as well as concession acquisitions and shareholdings.
- This also includes guarantees for untied financial loans and Hermes cover for the development of new or difficult markets.
- In addition, we intend to further strengthen advice and support for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in securing raw materials, improving raw material efficiency and building networks.
- 
- We want up-to-date and effective protection of intellectual property in order to continue to create incentives for risky investments in new technologies, business processes and creative works.
- This is essential for Germany as an increasingly digitized knowledge and media center, which derives its global competitiveness largely from the skills and intelligence of its researchers, developers and creative artists.
- The necessary international agreements must be negotiated and adopted in a transparent and comprehensible manner.
- We want to involve German SMEs more than before in foreign trade policy, for example by accompanying SMEs on foreign markets and supporting the expansion of exports of innovative services.
- In development cooperation, we want to further expand cooperation with the private sector.
- We want to facilitate the conditions for investment by German as well as local companies and the development of local and regional markets by improving the framework conditions with development cooperation funds. -
This includes better infrastructures,
- creating and strengthening the legal framework, -
fighting corruption,
- education and training.
- 
II. opportunities for everyone to grow beyond themselves
We want to create the conditions for every person in our country to develop freely, overcome obstacles and become happy according to their own ideas.
We liberals want opportunities regardless of origin.
One of the most important prerequisites for such a self-determined life remains the earliest possible and lifelong access to individual education and further training for everyone.
Our claim is therefore that education as a civil right is open to everyone regardless of background.
This also includes comprehensive personality development, which empowers and motivates people to take responsibility for their own lives and for society.
To this end, we guarantee everyone who seeks education freedom of choice among a variety of offerings, so that they can fully develop their own creativity in a fair competition for quality.
We want to empower all people to live a life of dignity.
Good education and training is the prerequisite for advancement.
But if you want to move up, you first have to be able to get in.
That is why we want to keep non-wage labor costs low,
further open up the labor market
and reward effort with the liberal citizen's income
and reduce bureaucracy.
We want to create the possibilities that in a republic of free citizens everyone can go their own way and overcome borders.
Therefore, in our society, we stand in solidarity with those who are in need and are willing to make an effort themselves.
For these people, we want to further strengthen our social security systems and make them fit for the future
- not to administer hardship or to aliment a personal situation, but so that everyone has a fair chance to be self-determined.
Seizing opportunities - lifelong education
The prerequisite for making our society's promise of advancement, with its social market economy, a reality for everyone in our country is, above all, a good education policy.
So that everyone can develop their talents and ideas - to their advantage and to the benefit of all.
To this end, we have increased spending on education and research by almost 14 billion euros in recent years,
for additional study places,
introduced the Deutschlandstipendium,
the promotion of continuing professional development
and improved the BAfÃ¶G and the Meister-BAfÃ¶G.
With the education package, we are creating new access to educational and cultural opportunities for 2.5 million children in our country.
By continuing the "Truants - the Second Chance" program, we have worked hard to help young people get back into education
and introduced the "Education Chains" program, which supports young people in the transition from school to training and work.
Our basic approach to educational policy is also shaped by the pedagogical insight that self-reliant and independent people can only be raised, taught and educated in an environment that acts and models self-reliance.
Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) has become an important and indispensable basic element of education policy in recent years.
By orienting education to the guiding principle of sustainable development, new paths are being taken to prepare learners for life and business in the 21st century.
Liberal education policy aims to support this reorientation in order to secure and expand the future viability of our education policy.
Liberal education policy thus lays the foundation for more people to have more opportunities in the future.
It is the best equipment for a life in freedom and responsibility.
We will continue along this path.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want education to be a civil right open to everyone, regardless of their social background.
- That is why investing in education is a priority for us.
- We want to expand the corresponding infrastructure
- and individual efforts such as private educational savings,
- Professional development
- and promote lifelong learning.
- 
- We liberals are committed to educational federalism because it enables freedom, diversity and competition on merit.
- Decisions on the best solutions can best be made on site.
- At the same time, we advocate greater comparability between the federal states.
- This ensures a common level of performance and facilitates the mobility of learners and teachers.
- We therefore want a new education constitution that is based on the principle of subsidiarity,
- binding common standards,
- defines responsibilities for financial burdens of political decisions (principle of connectivity),
- Reducing bureaucracy
- and strengthens students, teachers and parents.
- We want self-governing and autonomous schools, because decisions can best be made locally so that freedom can develop, diversity can be maintained and competition can develop.
- The independence of educational institutions is the core of liberal education policy.
- Many decisions can be made more effectively and better by the individual institution.
- To this end, the educational institutions should have their own budget and be given more educational freedom.
- This is the only way they can focus on their own specific challenges and develop their own profiles and thus compete fairly with independent schools.
- 
- We want to improve the education system for all students and trainees through quality-promoting competition between all providers.
- We want to enforce the right to establish and operate independent schools, which is enshrined in our constitution.
- We therefore advocate for their adequate funding and call for the removal of unjustified barriers to the establishment of independent schools and of Article 7 (5) of the Basic Law.
- 
- Outstanding education and training can only succeed thanks to outstanding teachers.
- We therefore want to press ahead with the Excellence Initiative for the area of teacher training and thus support progressive concepts in the qualification of our next generation of teachers.
- 
- Daycare centers are places of caring and early childhood education.
- This is where the foundations for the further educational path are laid, and thus the foundations for the future of our children.
- In the coming years, the focus must be on improving the quality of childcare facilities, expanding high-quality daycare centers and the supply of daycare parents.
- Early childhood, preschool education should be designed in such a way that children are prepared for school, especially through the teaching of language skills.
- We want to improve the training and continuing education of daycare workers and make a degree in education from a university of applied sciences or a comparable qualification a prerequisite for managing a facility.
- 
- Movement and learning complement each other and have a high degree of interaction.
- It has been proven that movement increases performance and mental receptivity and acts like a motor for child development and lifelong learning. -
That's why it's important to start promoting physical activity in preschool education, crÃ¨ches and daycare centers
- and to offer sufficient, qualified sports programs at school, also in cooperation with clubs.
- 
- Qualifying degrees obtained through the vocational school system are evidence of the permeability of our system.
- We want to strengthen the successful dual vocational training system.
- We need all talented people, because they enrich society and at the same time counteract the demographically induced shortage of skilled workers.
- We are fighting against the tightening of entry restrictions.
- For many occupational fields, academization can only be considered as an additional differentiation, but not as a strict entry requirement.
- The diversity of educational paths is our strength.
- 
- The transition from general education to the world of work must be adequately promoted and developed.
- 
- We Liberals are committed to creating a sociopolitical climate in which illiteracy is de-tabooed and all sociopolitical forces are sensitized.
- In order to increase educational opportunities for the 7.5 million functionally illiterate people, we want to develop the National Strategy for Literacy and Basic Education into a National Literacy Decade, establish an Alpha Foundation, and expand course offerings that are as comprehensive and demand-oriented as possible.
- 
o For us, inclusion means seeing every person with and without disabilities as an equal member in the middle of our society.
o Ideally, natural interaction between people with and without disabilities begins in childhood.
o We therefore want to expand inclusion in early childhood, which is already successful in many places, and continue this in everyday school life.
o Teachers, parents and children should be optimally prepared for the associated challenges and schools and school authorities should be equipped accordingly.
o We want to enable schools and school associations to adapt to the support needs of the students entrusted to them by giving them maximum organizational, educational and financial freedom.
o The individual student is at the center of our concept of inclusion.
o Depending on the individual case, the best possible support can take place both in the regular school system and in a special school. o We reject an
ideology that generally rejects special schools and therefore wants to abolish them.
o We do not close our eyes to the problems that arise in some schools as a result of inclusion, for example, of students with educational difficulties.
o The focus must be on the child, with and without disabilities.
o We are expressly committed to the individual and performance-oriented support of all children in a differentiated school system, which should also include special schools in the future.
o Inclusion must also be further promoted at vocational schools and interlinked with school social work.
o 
- People's education does not end with a school or academic degree.
- People learn throughout their lives.
- Continuing education opens up lifelong opportunities for development and enables career advancement.
- That's why we want to support individual efforts toward education at every age, for example through private education savings, education vouchers and the funding opportunities for employees that we have expanded through the Federal Employment Agency.
- 
- We want to give a second chance to those who have left our education system without qualifications.
- We want to make it easier for young people in particular to catch up on their vocational and school qualifications while working.
- People without vocational training or with broken educational biographies need a second chance for education and training.
- The range of educational courses and measures for these people must be coordinated by an independent body.
- 
- Investments in training and continuing education must have a primary impact on the primary labor market, because this secures real employment and generates sustainable added value.
- We want to give people prospects who need a second chance.
- This applies not only to students who have left school without a diploma, but also to those who have had to take up vocational training that did not meet their needs and talents or that is no longer in demand on the labor market.
- We want to qualify these people for the labor market in a targeted manner through individualized offers and the possibility of catching up on a recognized vocational qualification.
- This requires extensive integration into companies during the qualification process.
- In this way, we secure the demand for skilled workers and give people a real second chance on the labor market.
- 
- Excellent teaching and research needs freedom.
- That is why we stand for the autonomy and independence of universities.
- In this way, we create flexibility and enable universities to develop their own profiles.
- In the future, we want to reorganize the basic funding of university teaching across the LÃ¤nder and switch to the principle of "money follows students" (GefoS).
- For every student who chooses a university, the university will receive a payment from a fund financed by contributions from all the states according to the KÃ¶nigstein Key.
- The basis for calculating the payments to the universities are rates that take into account the different costs for different fields of study offered and types of universities.
- The LÃ¤nder have the option of increasing this basic funding.
- This keeps federal competition intact.
- At the same time, however, supra-regionally comparable competitive conditions and incentives for an attractive range of studies are created.
- 
- We want to further promote the quality of teaching at our universities and colleges.
- For us Liberals, the education of academics is of central importance for the future viability of our country.
- To this end, we will continue the "Excellence in Teaching" competition.
- We also want to support the states by continuing the Higher Education Pact.
- 
- We support unbureaucratic cooperation between universities and non-university research institutions.
- In addition, the federal government should be allowed to support science and research beyond temporary project funding, thereby ensuring a certain degree of planning security in the area of university funding.
- 
o We want to further develop the Excellence Initiative.
o The funding of graduate schools and the cluster competition have provided important impetus for the competitiveness of universities, and these should be continued.
o At the same time, the Excellence Competition promotes the steering capability of universities and thus contributes significantly to the institutional development of strategy and management competence.
o Universities of applied sciences and private universities should also be able to participate in the competition.
o 
- We want to expand the Deutschlandstipendium, open it up to doctoral students and significantly increase the number of scholarships.
- Universities should no longer be restricted by quotas in awarding their scholarships, but should be allowed to award them to the extent that they generate private grants. -
At the same time, we want to take inflation into account in the amount of state scholarships
, - make BAfÃ¶G less bureaucratic, - make it
independent of parents
- and decouple it from the standard period of study for students with disabilities.
- 
- For more internationality in education, we want to strengthen the increased use of foreign languages in courses at universities, among others
- as well as attract more international students, lecturers and researchers, and tap the hitherto often untapped potential of multilingualism among people with an immigrant background.
- 
- The states should have the option of allowing downstream tuition fees.
- The universities are responsible for structuring this.
- The full amount of these tuition fees should remain at the state universities and be used to improve teaching.
- 
- We are committed to making personnel structures at universities more flexible and to a nationwide collective agreement for academics that will make it possible to employ specialists in research and teaching in a manner commensurate with their tasks and to create more attractive conditions for mid-level faculty and highly qualified young academics.
- 
- Universities with independent sponsorship must be established as equal partners in the competition for the best minds.
- We aim to make it easier for independent universities to enter the market through fair competitive conditions, so that they can develop into an important part of the German higher education system.
- The GefoS model should also be opened up to private universities.
- 
- Lifelong learning is also one of the goals of the Bologna Process.
- We want to pursue this goal by promoting the range of continuing education courses as well as part-time and part-time study courses.
- In this way, we want to create academic continuing education opportunities for every stage of life.
- 
- As convinced democrats, we are committed to ensuring that all status groups involved can participate in university bodies and represent their interests.
- Since university policy decisions are made at different political levels, we also advocate for democratically legitimized student representation at these political levels to enable representation of interests.
- 
- In order to strengthen the European Higher Education Area, we advocate uniform European semester start times that make it easier to spend a semester abroad.
Furthermore, we want to establish scholarships for short stays abroad (less than three months)
- and promote more international double degrees through better cooperation with foreign universities.
- 
The gateway to advancement - opportunities on the labor market
Labor market policy is opportunity policy that enables more people to get into work - and thus creates opportunities for their own lives.
Unemployment is falling, and youth unemployment is lower than in almost any other European country.
Since the fall of 2009, 1.6 million jobs subject to social insurance contributions have been created in Germany.
On average, one person found a new job in Germany every 80 seconds.
This shows: Germany is enabling more and more people to move up the ladder.
This is a success for the people who have created growth and new jobs in Germany through their hard work.
And it is a success of liberal labor market policy.
We have fought state intervention in the social market economy
and kept the labor market flexible and open.
This makes it easier for many people to get into work, for example by raising the earnings limit for mini-jobs to 450 euros and simplifying the recognition of foreign educational qualifications.
We have made the labor market instruments more flexible and clearer.
Local job centers and employment agencies have been given more decision-making power in funding; results are presented transparently.
We have also reduced non-wage labor costs - most recently by lowering pension contributions to 18.9 percent.
We prevented the Agenda 2010 reforms from being reversed -
and with immense effort pushed through further changes to give more people the chance to get into work.
We will continue to follow this path consistently.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to further stabilize non-wage labour costs at well below 40 percent and return surpluses in the social insurance funds to the contributors in an appropriate manner.
- This is another reason why we do not consider converting the contribution-financed social systems into a political redistribution mechanism, such as a single pension or citizens' insurance, which is a compulsory citizens' insurance.
- 
- Our labor market model is successful because it is based on collective bargaining autonomy and flexible collective bargaining partnerships between employers' associations and trade unions.
- We are committed to collective bargaining autonomy.
- Blanket wage setting by politicians also does not do justice to the differentiated labor market situation and the varying cost of living in Germany.
- That is why we strongly reject a general, nationwide minimum wage. -
It politicizes wage setting
- and prevents people, especially younger people and those with low qualifications, from entering the labor market.
- It also encourages evasions such as undeclared work. - The
minimum wage thus becomes a sociopolitical boomerang:
- The group of employees that is supposed to be protected by a uniform minimum wage ends up without a job and with poorer entry opportunities.
- 
- People who work hard should be paid fairly according to their performance, especially at the lower end of the wage scale.
- In Germany, the Collective Agreement Act, the Employee Posting Act and the Minimum Working Conditions Act already provide for the possibility of declaring collective agreements to be generally binding or setting a minimum wage in individual sectors.
- In this legislative period, we have therefore declared collective agreements negotiated by collective bargaining parties to be generally binding for well over two million employees, thereby setting a wage floor in the respective industry.
- 
- We want to continue along this path in the spirit of the social market economy and create the possibility for further wage floors - in harmony with collective bargaining autonomy.
- To this end, we will revise and better coordinate the existing regulations for minimum wages.
- The starting point is the wages negotiated by unions and employers in collective agreements.
- This is the core of Germany's successful collective bargaining autonomy.
- In the future, too, wage floors will be set sector by sector - in a decentralized and differentiated manner.
- In this way, we also want to further strengthen the role of trade unions and employers.
- 
o We therefore want to create the possibility, particularly in the Posted Workers Act, for all sectors to have the wage floor of a representative collective agreement declared generally binding at the joint request of the collective bargaining partners and with the approval of the collective bargaining committee.
o We also want to make the subsidiary procedure under the Minimum Working Conditions Act more practicable for sectors in which a representative collective agreement does not exist.
o The undefined legal concept of social distortions can be dropped.
o We want to strengthen the main committee and remove it from political influence.
o As in generally binding collective agreements, regional differences must be taken into account and sensible exceptions made, for example for trainees.
o The subsequent effect of collective agreements should be limited in time.
o In order to prevent monopolies or cartels from forming via the detour of collective bargaining law, in future the Federal Cartel Office is to issue an opinion in every procedure for declarations of general applicability under the Posted Workers Act and procedures under the Minimum Working Conditions Act, taking particular account of whether a collective agreement to be declared generally applicable interferes with competition in favor of a market-determining company, as was the case with Deutsche Post AG.
o 
- We believe it is right that all recipients of unemployment benefit II who are employed should be officially checked to determine whether they are being paid immoral wages.
- If it turns out that too much unemployment benefit II has been paid as a result, the job centers should consistently and legally reclaim this from the employers.
- The job centers must take into account not only the social security aspects but also the criminal law aspects.
- 
- Our response to the inadequate income of many low-skilled workers is also to step up our efforts in the area of further training.
- We have already improved the funding opportunities for continuing vocational training so that social advancement on the labor market is successful and the income situation of many people improves in the long term.
- We are particularly committed to promoting well-founded and market-oriented training and continuing education for low-skilled workers and therefore want to support individual efforts toward education at all ages, for example through private education savings and the expanded funding opportunities of the Federal Employment Agency for employees - in line with the principle of encourage and demand.
- 
- At the same time, we must ensure that everyone has the perspective of being able to get by without social benefits through their own efforts.
- Looking at hourly wages is not enough here, because the majority of people who receive unemployment benefit II in addition to their earned income only work part-time or have a larger family to support.
- The liberal citizen's income is and remains the right idea for this.
- It motivates people to extend their working hours, for example.
- Self-generated income always means a noticeably larger total disposable income.
- The additional income options of unemployment benefit II (ALG II) must be oriented to this.
- 
- Following the abandonment of the principle of collective bargaining unity by the Federal Labor Court, there has been no discernible increase in the number of strikes in Germany.
- The risk of abuse of the right to strike by micro-unions can be adequately countered by changes at the level of industrial action law; there is no need for a new legal regulation of collective bargaining unity.
- 
o We want more self-employment in Germany.
o Compared with other countries, Germany has a lower-than-average proportion of self-employed and start-up entrepreneurs.
o We want to change this, because in addition to the undisputed economic advantages, a society's entrepreneurial spirit is an important expression of its liberality.
o For this reason, we will evaluate the changed labor market policy instrument of the start-up subsidy to see whether such a low-threshold support program financed from contributions or taxes can again make a stronger contribution.
o This could include, for example, examining additional tax incentive models for donors of venture capital
o and improving the image of start-ups and self-employment, for example by including it in school curricula.
o 
- In order to facilitate the restructuring of companies and thus preserve jobs, the scope of application of Section 613a BGB is to be reviewed in the event of imminent illiquidity and insolvency of a company.
- 
- Flexible forms of employment strengthen the incentives for companies to create new jobs, offer entry opportunities for job seekers and have contributed significantly to reducing unemployment.
- Both temporary and fixed-term employment do not change the normal social security obligations.
- The same applies to protection in the event of illness, dismissal or pregnancy.
- We therefore want to maintain these instruments and, where it makes sense, develop them further.
- The limit for mini-jobs (currently â¬450) is also to be regularly adjusted again in line with wage developments in the near future, in order to give mini-jobbers the chance to receive salary increases.
- 
- Temporary work is an entry-level opportunity in the labor market, especially for the low-skilled.
- Around two thirds of all employees in temporary work were previously unemployed. - There is
now a binding minimum wage based on collective agreements
- revolving door models like those at Schlecker have been ruled out by law
- and the social partners have been made responsible by the federal government for solving the so-called equal pay problem through industry surcharges.
- Thus, on the timeline, the wage gap between employees in temporary work and the workforces of the user companies is now closing.
- All this shows: Through targeted legislation, we have prevented abuse in temporary employment without losing the industry as a job engine.
- We must continue along this path.
- 
- A look at the law should reveal the legal situation.
- It is long overdue to bring the decision of the BAG on statutory periods of notice into the Federal Law Gazette.
- The ECJ has found inadmissible age discrimination in the calculation of statutory periods of notice.
- The new regulations must not tighten protection against dismissal and must be designed to be employment-friendly.
- 
- Very few employees are regularly employed on fixed-term contracts.
- For many, a fixed-term contract is the entry into work and permanent employment with the same employer. -
That's why - in response to an ECJ ruling - we want to relax the ban on pre-employment in fixed-term employment
- and at the same time effectively prevent chain fixed-term contracts by introducing a one-year waiting period.
- 
- We want to expand the dual training system.
- This combination of vocational practice and school-based training is an essential foundation stone for economic success and for social balance in Germany.
- It is an export hit for the European region and beyond.
- The dual training system with vocational schools and business high schools should stand independently and on an equal footing with higher education.
- 
- The dual career path has also proven its worth in sports.
- It offers top athletes prospects for the time after their athletic careers. -
Existing models, such as the sports support units of the German Armed Forces, the German Federal Police and the German Customs, should therefore be continued
- and also opened up as far as possible to Paralympic athletes.
- Incentives for reconciling school, university or work and top-level sport should be strengthened.
- 
- We want immigration law that gives skilled workers a chance in the labor market.
- Germany must be open to talented people from all over the world, establish a welcoming culture and actively and specifically recruit bright minds.
- We want to continue the liberalization of immigration of skilled workers and the introduction of modern immigration law.
- 
o The existing potential of skilled workers in Germany is to be better utilized in order to secure individual opportunities and promote growth.
o Companies that actively focus on diversity strategies ("diversity management") in their corporate management are economically more successful.
o Supporting corresponding efforts is part of our growth strategy for Germany as a business location.
o 
- We want to introduce liberal "AlterNsmanagement" as an organizational form of a life-phase-oriented and preventive personnel policy in companies and public administration.
- On the basis of individual areas of responsibility for each employee, career-related training, family-oriented working hours, age-appropriate jobs and varied activities are the best instruments for promoting learning ability and motivation at any age.
- Ultimately, they are the best guarantee of job satisfaction.
- The challenges of demographic change can only be met if employees and employers share responsibility.
- 
Creating opportunities instead of managing shortages - social security for all
We create opportunities by continuing to make the social systems reliable and adapting them to people's actual needs.
We want to keep costs under control and thus create the prerequisite for helping everyone who needs this help in the future as well.
Before we joined the federal government, social policy in Germany only managed shortages:
The Federal Employment Agency had a gaping hole of 13.8 billion euros - and a deficit of 55 billion was expected by 2013.
Through growth and reforms, we have reversed this trend in recent years.
In labor market policy, we do not rely on the watering-can principle, but on targeted support for re-entry into the labor market and effective monitoring of effectiveness.
We have consistently resisted all attempts to turn the social systems into a political redistribution tool.
In addition, we have strengthened private pension provision and intend to continue along this path.
Riester products have become more transparent and attractive thanks to the liberals.
We have raised the subsidy ceiling for basic old-age provision.
We have strengthened private coverage for disability and occupational disability and made it
considerably easier to save for home ownership ("homeowner's pension").
The success of our policy: surpluses in the billions in the pension fund and genuine budget autonomy for the Federal Employment Agency - and thus falling contributions and secure, high-quality social benefits for the people in our country.
In this way, we relieve the burden on people, give them security and help those who make an effort to develop themselves despite all the restrictions and difficulties.
To ensure that this remains the case, we want to further strengthen our social security systems and make them fit for the future.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Anyone who needs help from the tax-financed social system should receive it quickly and unbureaucratically.
- We are backing the introduction of the Liberal Citizen's Income because it rewards individual efforts
- and bureaucracy.
- With the liberal citizen's income, we want to reorganize support for the needy and unemployed.
- This includes unemployment benefit II including benefits for housing and heating, social benefit, basic income support in old age and in the event of reduced earning capacity, social assistance (excluding social assistance in special circumstances), child supplement and housing benefit.
- Those who make an effort and take a job should keep more of their income in the citizen's income model.
- 
- We want to gradually implement the citizen's income and, above all, systematically continue the flat-rate payment of social benefits begun in recent years.
- We want to make the optional flat-rate payment of housing costs the rule in Unemployment Benefit II, at a regionally appropriate level.
- In this way, not every rental contract has to be submitted to the office, and any savings from lower rental or heating costs will partially benefit the recipient of benefits.
- Further mergers of local authorities based on the principle of "all services from a single source" should be examined.
- At the same time, as a further step, we want to make it possible for job centers to convert passive benefits for the long-term unemployed into active labor market measures to a limited extent.
- 
- Today, help and support for the long-term unemployed is only available from a single source.
- Either the municipality takes over the tasks itself or it shares the tasks together with the Federal Employment Agency.
- To be able to compare the performance of municipalities and joint institutions, we need transparency and clear benchmarks.
- Municipalities should be free to decide whether to organize employment services themselves.
- 
- The Federal Employment Agency is to continuously improve its performance:
- Individual case management with well-trained mediators and a sensible support key are to pave the way for even more people into the labor market.
- 
- In the future, allowances and imputation rates for unemployment benefit II should be designed in such a way that full-time jobs are particularly attractive.
- After all, it has been proven that reaching these working hours and income levels gives people a better chance of leaving need behind once and for all.
- To be fair, it remains the case that unemployment benefit II can be reduced if a reasonable job is refused.
- 
o We advocate more self-determination in retirement without rigid age limits.
o From the age of 60, people should be free to choose when they retire - with actuarially correct increases and reductions - provided their entitlements from private, statutory and occupational pension schemes are above the basic income support level.
o At the same time, we want to remove barriers to work in old age and completely abolish limits on additional earnings in addition to pension payments.
o Insured persons can thus reduce their working hours from the age of 60 and compensate for the loss of earnings by drawing a partial pension or, if they wish, work longer.
o 
- Integration assistance will be replaced by a federal benefits law.
- We want to combine benefits for people with disabilities and make them more personalized.
- The personal budget is to be expanded and simplified, in particular by means of lump-sum payments.
- Benefits that compensate for the disadvantages of the disability (compensation for disadvantages) are to be granted irrespective of income.
- By contrast, subsistence benefits will be paid according to need, as is the case for every other beneficiary.
- 
- Insured persons must be able to plan their lives in such a way that the amount of their pension is based on the contributions they have paid in.
- That is why we Liberals are in favor of a consistently contribution-based pension.
- Extensions to family or social policy benefits must not be financed through contributions.
- 
- We want to make the old-age provision in the statutory pension insurance system fit for the future and supplement it to a greater extent with private and occupational pension provision, with statutory pension insurance, occupational pensions and private pension provision coexisting.
- We need a mix of pay-as-you-go and funded provision to balance out different risks and securities.
- With a view to intergenerational justice, we therefore reject a reversal of past pension reforms, which were aimed at lowering the statutory pension level, stabilizing contributions and expanding private provision.
- We reject a one-size-fits-all insurance system, for example by including occupational pension schemes.
- 
- We want to make private pension provision attractive for everyone, including low-income earners.
- For this reason, income from private and company pension plans may only be partially offset against the basic old-age pension.
- This is an effective way of countering the risk of future poverty in old age at an early stage.
- We also want to open the way to Riester subsidies for the self-employed.
- 
- We want to abolish the double burden of social security contributions on company pension plans introduced by the Red-Green coalition in 2004.
- 
- In the discussion on the introduction of compulsory pension insurance for the self-employed, we are fundamentally opposed to a compulsory solution that is hostile to start-ups and innovation. -
This threatens the existence of the self-employed and the creation of jobs:
- Those who already make provisions today will have to restructure their provision, if necessary with massive losses - and those who cannot yet afford old-age provision due to a lack of profits will be driven into insolvency and into dependence on state transfer systems.
- 
- Under the current legal situation, different pension systems would continue to exist in the east and west for the foreseeable future.
- For us, the standardization of pension law in the east and west is an imperative of fairness.
- 
- We want to return the payment of social security contributions to the 15th day of the following month.
- The bureaucratic costs incurred by companies as a result of the current arrangement are out of all proportion to the benefits to the public sector.
- 
- We want to make future social elections more democratic, transparent and effective.
- We want to abolish one-size-fits-all lists and enable genuine choice.
- In doing so, the possibility of online participation must be created and a simple and transparent compilation of the lists must be ensured.
- 
Seizing opportunities - living healthy together
We want freedom of choice and design options to go hand in hand
with the necessary solidarity.
If the two are combined wisely, together we can turn yesterday's burdens into opportunities for tomorrow.
Until 2009, shortages were managed in the social systems.
At that time, billions were missing in statutory health insurance alone.
We have managed to reverse the trend and put the social security funds back on a firm footing.
To this end, we have ensured more competition between health insurance funds and on the pharmaceutical market.
At the same time, we are currently saving up to two billion euros through lower costs for medicines alone.
In these years, we were able to achieve: Surpluses at the health insurance funds and the first steps toward a solidly financed long-term care insurance system with an entry into capital coverage.
To make healthcare in rural areas fit for the future, we have set incentives for physicians.
With the reform of the Transplantation Act, we have improved hospital procedures for organ donation and provided better protection for living organ donors.
With the promotion of private long-term care provision
and the introduction of services for dementia patients and their relatives, we have achieved a great deal for people.
Finally, with the abolition of the practice fee, we have once again succeeded in countering excessive bureaucracy and relieving the burden on patients.
We will continue on the path of the last four years toward a free and diverse health care system
and at the same time offer sufficient security to ensure that those affected do not fall into financial hardship in the event of illness.
To this end, we want to strengthen our health and care system and ensure that health and care insurance remains affordable in the future.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We stand for a liberal healthcare system that combines solidarity and personal responsibility.
- We are against centrally controlled state medicine, which only leads to paternalism, shortage management and waiting lists and turns patients into supplicants.
- Instead, the well-being of patients must be at the center of medical care.
- 
- Freedom of choice for citizens remains the maxim of liberal health policy.
- That is why we continue to advocate freedom of choice of physician, freedom of therapy, freedom of choice in health insurance, insurance coverage and hospitals.
- This includes strong private health insurance.
- This also includes the abolition of budget medicine and the introduction of the reimbursement principle in the area of statutory health insurance.
- For this purpose, every patient should receive a bill showing the costs of the services used.
- We reject the idea of a single health insurance fund with standardized care for a single patient.
- 
- For a strong dual health insurance system, it is also important to make private health insurance fit for the future.
- This includes, among other things, transparency in basic rates and concepts for both premium development and the portability of age-related provisions.
- 
- We want to further expand the contribution autonomy of the health insurance funds and reduce redistribution through the health fund.
- The move to decouple health insurance contributions from wages and salaries was the right one.
- The necessary social compensation for those who cannot pay their contributions should continue to be financed from tax revenues and thus by all taxpayers according to their ability to pay.
- 
- Modern healthcare does not see those involved as lone warriors.
- Rather, cooperation, collaboration and the distribution of tasks play a major role in providing good care for patients. -
We are committed to ensuring that tasks are clearly regulated and distributed among those involved
- and we want to enhance the value of medical and non-medical professions and make them more attractive.
- 
- The liberal professions are a guarantee for an efficient healthcare system.
- We will therefore uphold the freelance nature of the healthcare professions.
- In addition, we recognize the role of care models with employed physicians in the outpatient sector.
- 
- We want to ensure the preservation of a pharmacy network close to home. - In order
to provide qualified advice on medicines, pharmacies need to continue to receive performance-related remuneration,
attractive working conditions
and a further reduction in bureaucratic regulations.
- 
- Bureaucracy must be reduced at all levels in the healthcare system. (for example, excessive documentation requirements at service providers, public bodies and health insurers).
- 
- The education, training and continuing education of nursing staff is of decisive importance in ensuring that the quality of nursing care remains at a high level in the long term.
- In addition, attractive training with clearly regulated financing arrangements makes a decisive contribution to improving the reputation and acceptance of the nursing profession.
- 
o We oppose efforts to ensure that in the future only high school graduates are allowed to do nursing training.
o Instead, we want to improve recognition and development opportunities for the nursing professions. Nurses should be able to develop further and then take on additional tasks. o The
challenges of nursing have now arrived in the hospital and the medical issues in the nursing home.
o We are therefore in favor of merging the three previously separate training programs for pediatric nurses, nurses and geriatric nurses into a generalist nursing training program with further development prospects.
o 
- In long-term care insurance, people need alternatives to traditional outpatient and inpatient care, such as those created by promoting residential groups.
- We want to ensure good quality care for people with dementia and their relatives.
- In order to do justice to their special problems, the criteria for the need for care should also change from physical tasks to a classification based on the remaining independence.
- 
- A policy of budgeting will lead to a shortage of doctors, nurses and other service providers in the face of demographic change.
- In order to continue to ensure good care in the event of illness or nursing care in the future, we need performance-based remuneration and good working conditions.
- This includes the compatibility of family and career as well as efficient work processes. -
This also includes the reduction of bureaucratic regulation,
- the qualification of as many people as possible,
- the targeted recruitment of returnees to the healthcare professions
- and the controlled immigration of people from abroad who would like to work in the healthcare sector in Germany.
- 
- In nursing care, it is essential to further reduce bureaucracy and documentation requirements so that as much time as possible remains for actual care.
- That is why we want to place greater emphasis on monitoring the quality of outcomes rather than prescribing structures and processes.
- 
- Demographic change is posing anew the question of financing between the generations.
- That is why we need to strengthen capital coverage.
- We have taken a first important step in promoting private long-term care provision.
- We want to continue along this path.
- 
- Particularly against the backdrop of an aging population, it is important to us that high-quality medical care in Germany continues to be available close to home at low cost for all and that people can lead a self-determined life even in old age.
- We support the greater use of telemedicine and the removal of legal liability requirements for the use of telemedicine applications.
- The use of technical assistance systems enables the elderly and sick to live better lives.
- 
- Good prevention improves the quality of life, avoids diseases or at least delays their onset.
- We therefore want to further strengthen prevention, especially in the areas of infectious diseases (such as HIV), mental illnesses, and malnutrition.
- To this end, every institution must make its contribution with clear financial and task responsibility.
- Municipalities, health insurance companies, health care professionals, employers in the context of occupational health care and the Federal Center for Health Education all have a role to play here.
- The same applies to those who can influence healthy lifestyles in kindergartens, schools and clubs.
- Sport has a special role to play here, making a significant contribution to cost containment in the healthcare system.
- 
o Despite all prevention efforts, people suffer permanent restrictions in their participation in professional and social life, e.g. as a result of illnesses or accidents.
o This risk increases with age. o A
large proportion of the people affected can be helped back to a largely independent life through rehabilitation measures.
o Through sufficient funding and effective cooperation between the providers of measures, we want to ensure that the principle of "rehabilitation before retirement" can be adhered to even in times of demographic change.
o Even at retirement age, everyone should be supported, if necessary, to live independently for as long as possible. o
This not only serves the individual, but also helps society, which is increasingly dependent on the active participation of older people.
o Quality-assured rehabilitation leads to considerable savings in reduced earning capacity pensions and care benefits.
- Despite many advances in many areas, our health care system is not yet sufficiently adapted to people's increasingly long lifespans.
- For example, geriatric competence is needed in all health care professions, especially competence in dealing with dementia.
- We want to make geriatric medicine a stronger focus of medical research.
- At the same time, we want to support people in growing old as healthily as possible through a comprehensive prevention strategy.
- 
- The freedom of the individual includes the right to self-determination over one's own body.
- Self-determination takes precedence over the welfare considerations of third parties.
- It is the right of every individual to decide autonomously about medical treatment and to make appropriate arrangements in advance.
- Liberals strictly reject medical treatment against the declared will of the person concerned.
- We want to enable all people to live a dignified life to the end.
- The new regulations on living wills have proven their worth.
- We want to further improve the framework conditions for the provision of palliative care and hospice services.
- 
III. diversity so that everyone has a choice
We liberals want a free, diverse society.
People should decide for themselves how they want to live.
Politics must not impose a certain way of life on people.
Instead, we want to further strengthen freedom and diversity in Germany.
To this end, we want to enable new forms of solidarity, division of labor and social participation.
This is because globalization and the increasingly close interconnectedness of the world are leading to ever faster change.
With hardly any decision made today can we be sure that it will still lead to the desired results tomorrow.
A diverse and open society, on the other hand, can quickly correct mistakes and try out new things.
Diversity and openness therefore guarantee future viability.
We strengthen families and communities of responsibility.
Because a republic of free citizens thrives on people taking responsibility.
We want freedom of choice in life plans.
Enabling and living diversity in our society also means tolerating and accepting differences, but above all recognizing their value.
That's why we want real opportunities for greater participation for everyone in our society.
This also and especially applies under the conditions of demographic change.
Germany is becoming a country of longevity and thus also more diverse and experienced.
We want to turn these challenges into an opportunity for our country.
You can't have a diverse society without equality before the law.
Equal duties also mean equal rights.
For liberals, however, having equal rights does not mean making different things equal.
We focus on diversity.
Strengthening responsibility - in families and communities of responsibility
Love, security and recognition provide a strong foundation for the good development of an individual personality.
Children deserve our special protection.
Every child has the right to develop into an independent personality.
Opportunities, regardless of background, begin in early childhood.
We liberals see parents as responsible for their children first, and only then the state and society.
Today, family no longer means only the cohabitation of natural parents with their children.
In addition, single parents, patchwork families or same-sex couples with children, for example, also live together as families with a high sense of responsibility today.
The decision about the concrete form of one's own cohabitation is a private matter.
For us liberals, all partnerships in which people take responsibility for each other are equally valuable: Parents for their children, children for their parents, spouses and partners for each other.
But also people in other freely chosen communities of responsibility.
We want to strengthen self-determination for life models and encourage responsibility.
That is why we have relieved the burden on families with children in recent years through higher child benefits and higher tax allowances.
We have contributed to a total of 250,000 fewer children living in poverty today.
We have strengthened children's rights by fully implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
We introduced the first Federal Child Protection Act, setting a milestone in child protection in Germany.
Child noise as a cause of action was abolished.
We have continued to expand childcare with 780,000 new places through federal funding.
The education package for needy children was implemented,
as was the legal right to care for children under the age of three,
the childcare supplement in BAfÃ¶G
, and the simplified inclusion of self-employed persons in parental benefits.
We have adopted family care leave and enabled more flexible part-time solutions for employees.
We have launched a regulation on confidential birth in the Bundestag.
We have strengthened the rights of natural fathers and extended joint custody in the interests of the child.
For same-sex partners, we have achieved equality with spouses in numerous areas of life: in public service law, inheritance and real estate transfer tax, BAfÃ¶G and capital-forming benefits.
Freedom and responsibility are inseparable.
We will only become better and live better if we remember what made us strong: People who work hard - out of passion, out of love for others, out of responsibility.
We believe in these people.
Further strengthening them is our goal.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We are continuing to drive forward the expansion of high-quality childcare provision for the under-threes.
- To achieve this, we want to further improve the childcare ratio and the training of educators.
- The federal states should face up to their responsibilities here.
- We want to put company kindergartens and private facilities on an equal footing with public, non-profit and church organizations and reduce bureaucratic hurdles for new facilities.
- We also want to improve the position of childminders.
- 
- We want to make it easier to combine family and career.
- Those who take on responsibility for others should not have to do so at the cost of their own opportunities.
- That's why we want to further facilitate the use of flexible working time models, home office options, sabbaticals and the switch between full and part time in companies.
- 
- We want to make the use of parental allowance more flexible by improving part-time options and strengthening the partner months.
- In particular, we want to ensure that self-employment, single-parent families and part-time models are taken into account flexibly during parental leave.
- We want to create fair conditions for the self-employed with regard to parental allowance.
- Income earned by the self-employed prior to parental leave, but paid to them only during parental leave, should not be offset against parental allowance and thus lead to a reduction in parental allowance.
- 
o We want to reorganize family policy benefits on the basis of the evaluation carried out in recent years in order to reduce bureaucracy and increase the efficiency of the resources used. o The
recently introduced childcare allowance must also be reviewed with regard to its effects. o
If it does not achieve the goal of allowing more freedom of choice between private and state childcare, we want to abolish it again.
o In all benefits, we are guided primarily by the best interests of the child.
o 
- We want to test the bundling of all child-related services with a child card in a pilot project.
- This electronic card is an unbureaucratic and non-discriminatory way of providing children with direct support services.
- 
- Advance maintenance payments must once again be made a bridging benefit. - The
duration of its receipt should be shortened
- and in return, receipt should be extended until the child reaches the age of 18.
- 
- All child protection actors must work hand in hand to effectively prevent abuse and maltreatment and to intervene in a targeted manner in suspected cases.
- Significantly strengthening prevention and intervention will help to better prevent child neglect and abuse and family breakdown in the future.
- 
- This approach must be strengthened nationwide.
- For example, through joint prevention networks such as "Kein TÃ¤ter werden.
- 
- We want to effectively protect children and young people from sexual abuse in their diverse environments and improve support for those affected.
- An independent reappraisal of past abuse is a challenge for society as a whole, and we attach great importance to it.
- The social awareness-raising necessary to curb abuse is still in its infancy.
- An independent abuse commissioner will continue to be appointed by the federal government in the future.
- The legal status, tasks, rights and duties, as well as the participation of those affected, will be regulated by law.
- In addition, the Federal Government will establish an independent commission to conduct a comprehensive, systematic review of abuse in the institutional and family spheres, unless the German Bundestag establishes a commission of inquiry to review the situation.
- 
- For liberals, all partnerships in which people take responsibility for each other are equally valuable.
- All couples should be able to enter into marriage.
- Until then, the following applies: Those who have the same obligations also deserve the same rights.
- Registered civil partnerships must be put on an equal footing with marriage - especially in terms of income tax law, the Riester pension and adoptions.
- 
- At a time when traditional family structures are not always sustainable, especially in old age, there is a growing need for new forms of mutual security - beyond kinship or romantic relationships.
- That is why we want to introduce the legal institution of the community of responsibility in the German Civil Code with flexible modules for the assumption of responsibility between two or more persons.
- In order to maintain legal clarity with respect to other obligations, these persons must not be married, in partnership or related to each other in a direct line.
- Favourable treatment by the state in tax and social law, but also in inheritance law, is only justified if the partners assume full maintenance and support obligations like spouses.
- In order to prevent abuse, members of a community of responsibility are not entitled to refuse to testify or to family reunification under aliens law.
- 
- We want to create further options in family law.
- When marrying, spouses and registered partners should have the option of choosing community of acquisitions as a further optional matrimonial property regime.
- This is the legal property regime in most European countries.
- In this way, the assets acquired during the marriage become part of the joint assets and are not only compensated for in the form of gains upon separation.
- 
o We want to simplify the possibility of adoption.
o For example, we want the relationship to both biological parents to be maintained in the case of stepchild adoptions - provided that the mother, father and stepparent willing to adopt agree and that this is not contrary to the best interests of the child.
o The social reality of a higher life expectancy and a postponed family formation phase requires an adoption law that recognizes the signs of the times.
o As a rule, even an age difference of 50 years between the child and the parents should not give rise to doubts about the ability to raise the child.
o 
- In a Reproductive Medicine Act, we want to combine existing individual provisions and make egg donation possible.
- 
- All people should have legal access to the reproductive medical services permitted in Germany (e.g. artificial insemination), irrespective of their marital status.
- In the case of anonymous sperm donation as part of reproductive medical treatment, it should be stipulated that a child may learn of its parentage when it reaches the age of majority, but that claims to maintenance and inheritance are excluded.
- 
Strengthening civic engagement
We Liberals stand for a free and open civil society.
It supports people in their free development and their personal pursuit of happiness
and their commitment to the world around them.
Millions of people in our country are already involved today, making our society richer and warmer - we want to strengthen these people.
To this end, we have, among other things, noticeably increased the lump-sum allowances for exercise leaders and volunteers and clearly limited the liability risks for those involved in clubs.
We have strengthened the youth volunteer services (FSJ and FÃJ) and created the Federal Volunteer Service - thus implementing the largest engagement policy reform in the history of our country.
Whereas after 2009 an average of 68,000 people were still doing their compulsory civilian service, today 80,000 people are involved in voluntary services - but unlike in the case of civilian service, this is across genders and generations.
We Liberals do not see policies for civic engagement as piecemeal, but call for a common thread in the political framework for engagement.
We have made this claim clear with an engagement strategy of the federal government and the first engagement report.
We strengthen volunteerism and individual commitment.
The commitment of citizens and civil society organizations - from privately organized citizens' boards to foundations and associations to social organizations such as Freie Wohlfahrtspflege - therefore has a special value for us.
Civil society based on solidarity and openness is the expression of a society committed to freedom.
Their strength is diversity.
It creates new life opportunities - and new role models for citizens and companies.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Millions of Germans take on responsibility in their community in their personal environment, in associations, foundations and much more.
- We want to support these people in their voluntary work by freeing them from bureaucratic obstacles and encouraging others to follow suit.
- In tax law, the lump sums for expense allowances should be continuously adjusted in line with price trends and additional income regulations for state benefits should be changed so that expense allowances do not lead to a reduction in benefits.
- 
- We want to further strengthen the organizations and institutions in which volunteerism is possible.
- Clubs, foundations, associations and other civic organizations offer important opportunities for participation, help shape our society and assume social responsibility. -
They enable people to gain practical experience in a democratic system
- and, on the basis of their ever-new experiences, provide impetus for civil society as a whole.
- 
- With 27 million club members, sports associations are the largest civic movement in our country.
- Sport brings people together regardless of gender, age, social status, religious or political views, physical conditions, origin or sexual orientation.
- It promotes preventive health care, the building of community spirit and the elimination of prejudices.
- Sports associations and their volunteer supporters deserve our special support.
- The preservation and expansion of sports facilities are a matter of concern to us.
- 
- We Liberals are committed to promoting popular and competitive sports.
- However, only clean sport is eligible for funding.
- Taking performance-enhancing funds jeopardizes the idea of fair play and the exemplary character of sport.
- Prevention, self-regulation of sport by sport, investment in the latest detection systems and a climate of social civic courage against all forms of cheating are promising elements for combating doping in the long term.
- We are committed to the National Anti-Doping Agency Foundation (NADA) and call on the states and the private sector to increase their contributions to the foundation's capital.
- We Liberals reject the idea of criminalizing doping.
- The sharpest sword in the fight against doping remains the ban on competition.
- In addition, civil liability issues can be regulated in athletes' contracts.
- 
- The economic marketing and exploitation of sporting events is a prerequisite for the self-financing of organized sport.
- In this context, we pay attention to the property rights of sports organizers that are worthy of protection when modernizing copyright law.
- 
- We take violence on the sidelines of sporting events seriously.
- Nevertheless, fans must not be criminalized across the board.
- We want to critically examine the "Violent Offenders in Sport" file and, if necessary, abolish it.
- 
- We want to further simplify foundation law to facilitate the social commitment of individuals and companies.
- In addition, we want to enable private endowments to be added to the assets of federal foundations.
- 
- The reform of voluntary service demanded by us Liberals in the wake of the suspension of compulsory military service has led to a massive expansion of voluntary services.
- We want to strengthen this commitment of young and old by removing bureaucratic hurdles and better coordinating national and international voluntary services.
- We are committed to the further development of the European Voluntary Service into a European Voluntary Year that is open to citizens from all age groups.
- The voluntary services must not be misused as a labor market instrument; the principle of labor market neutrality must be respected.
- 
Living diversity - together in an open civil society
We want everyone in Germany to be able to go their own way without being patronized or pushed in a certain direction against their will.
Every person should have the opportunities to achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams through their own efforts - regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation or disability.
For liberals, it is normal to be different.
Liberal policies therefore provide special protection for diverse lifestyles and life plans - and thus for being different without fear.
We therefore support the development of "diversity strategies" ("Diversity-Strategies") and want our republican institutions to be role models and live diversity.
For us, tolerance also includes equal rights for same-sex partnerships.
Here we have pushed through various improvements.
In 2011, we pushed through the Federal Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, which counteracts discrimination against lesbians and gays through education and research.
We have developed independent programs on boys' and men's policies to improve gender equality.
We continue to work to increase the proportion of women in management positions in business and the public sector through voluntary commitments.
For us liberals, freedom of religion, including negative freedom of religion, is one of our unwaivable principles:
We actively advocate tolerance and respect for the religious beliefs or atheistic or agnostic worldviews of our fellow citizens.
We advocate equal treatment of churches, religions and ideological communities by the state.
Its ideological neutrality must be guaranteed as a matter of principle.
While the former make a valuable contribution to shaping coexistence in society, especially in the charitable sphere and in the communication of values, the latter thrives on ethical prerequisites that it cannot provide itself.
The state and religious communities work together according to the principle of cooperation:
The state and churches, religious communities and ideological communities are each independent and at the same time related to each other in the sense of the common good.
The decisive factor, however, is that the image of man and society of the respective community respects the value system of the Basic Law.
We have launched an independent youth policy.
While others define youth policy primarily in terms of commandments and prohibitions for seemingly immature young people or those with disadvantages and difficulties, we place our trust in young people in particular and want to give them more opportunities.
We have translated this conviction into practical policy with the driver's license for 17-year-olds, the Deutschlandstipendium scholarship, and the summer vacation job regulation for Hartz IV.
Policy for older people is more than just good social security.
We have opened up new perspectives for people who want to be active in old age, for example, by opening up voluntary services to all generations.
With the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we have created important incentives for an inclusive society in many areas.
Considerable relief was decided for the municipalities in the area of integration assistance.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- The task of politics is to preserve and promote diversity as well as to create the appropriate framework conditions for living diversity.
- The diversity of our society and the different experiences and talents associated with it lead to new opportunities for progress and innovation.
- At the same time, this opens up opportunities for social advancement for all those whose diligence, creativity and efforts lead to further innovations.
- 
o We want more career advancement opportunities for women in our country
o - and want to give more fathers the opportunity to reconcile work and family life.
To this end, we want to create framework conditions that encourage companies to create family-friendly workplaces. o
This requires making work more flexible, modernizing tax law - for example, abolishing income tax class V -
o and adaptable solutions in childcare options, such as promoting company kindergartens.
o 
- We want more women in management responsibility both in business and in the public sector. - It
has been shown that this is not only an imperative of fairness between the sexes,
- but that women lead companies very successfully and that mixed teams are often superior.
- We therefore expect companies in Germany to significantly improve the proportion of women in management positions and will work to achieve this in the public sector as well.
- As liberals, however, we reject a statutory quota.
- Instead, we rely on incentives for companies, binding reporting obligations and transparent voluntary commitments.
- In this way, we give companies the opportunity to shape better participation by women in such a way that it creates the best opportunities for the company and all employees.
- 
- We advocate the development of career-long and age-appropriate personnel management in business and society in order to utilize experience and promote lifelong learning ("AlterNsmanagement").
- We also want to make particular use of the experience of older people in our society.
- That is why we support such commitment, for example in so-called educational sponsorships or in the Federal Volunteer Service.
- Where necessary, we want to review existing age limits to give people of all ages the opportunity to serve society.
- 
- The existing potential of skilled workers in Germany is to be better utilized in order to secure individual opportunities and promote growth.
- Companies are more successful economically and administrations are closer to their citizens if they actively pursue diversity management strategies.
- Supporting this is also part of our growth strategy for Germany as a business location.
- Diversity and success go hand in hand.
- 
- We Liberals stand for an independent youth policy.
- We rely on strong youth welfare and strong youth work, especially through strong youth associations, which opens up opportunities for young people to participate and promotes and develops their potential.
- 
- We want to further develop opportunities for young people to participate as a central component of democratic culture.
- We Liberals are firmly committed to improving the participation of children and young people by offering them tailored, age-differentiated opportunities to participate in local political and social life.
- To this end, we want to press ahead with the reform of the Children and Youth Plan as a transparent and participatory funding instrument for children and youth policy.
- Children's and youth sites, children's and youth forums, youth councils and parliaments should be used and promoted by the relevant levels with clear standards for these participation instruments.
- 
- We advocate for clear regulation of youth noise to ensure planning certainty for ball fields and local recreational opportunities for youth.
- 
- In order to reduce social discrimination against lesbians and gays, we prioritize education and information instead of bureaucratic anti-discrimination laws.
- That is why we want to further strengthen the good work of the Federal Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation and increase the foundation's capital.
- We want to rehabilitate and adequately compensate homosexuals who were convicted in Germany under Section 175 of the Criminal Code and thus became victims of state discrimination.
- 
- We will work to ensure that homosexuals are no longer excluded per se from donating blood.
- 
- We will work for more acceptance and self-determination for transsexuals - especially in the working world.
- In a new transsexual law, we also want to reduce the hurdles to changing one's personal status.
- In the course of this, health insurance benefits for gender reassignment are to be secured and standardized.
- 
- We want to enable people with disabilities to actively participate in social life. -
This begins with the accessibility of public spaces:
- People with disabilities must be able to use all public buildings, means of transport and communication facilities independently of outside help.
- We want to make childcare facilities, schools and leisure and educational facilities inclusive.
- Accessibility serves everyone.
- Those who remove barriers make it possible for buildings, means of transportation, and products to be recognizable, accessible, and thus usable for everyone.
- That is why we also support the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
- We are also committed to a nationwide barrier-free emergency call by text message.
- 
- If the ability of people with disabilities or after serious illness to take up work is limited, we want to achieve the best possible participation in working life through part-time offers, vocational support measures and the expansion of inclusive jobs.
- In cases of need for assistance, we rely on the introduction of personal budgets so that people can decide independently and on their own responsibility which person or institution should provide the assistance.
- 
Immigration and integration in a diverse, open Germany
For a modern, open Germany, the following must apply: It doesn't matter where you come from.
It depends on where you want to go.
No matter where a person comes from, what background he has:
They can enrich our society - in business, in culture, in sports, in public life.
And he has a right to participate in this society.
Millions of people with a migration background live in our country.
Many of them were born here.
The vast majority of them have long been at home in this country.
They are our fellow citizens, friends and neighbors.
We are convinced that anyone who wants to participate in this society, who wants to contribute, should also be able to find a home here.
To this end, we in Germany can break down barriers and open doors.
At the same time, however, the willingness to participate is a prerequisite for coexistence in an open civil society.
This includes in particular the willingness to learn the German language
as well as the unconditional acceptance of our free democratic basic order.
With the National Action Plan on Integration and the instrument of the Integration Agreement, we are showing how we want to continue on this path toward coexistence in our society.
At the same time, however, we are also clearly demonstrating the limits of tolerance - for example, with the creation of criminal offenses to combat forced marriage and genital mutilation.
But offering opportunities for participation also means making every effort to enable people to integrate.
In many cases, the ability to integrate still depends on factors - family, educational background, social environment - which the individual can only influence with difficulty and which, in unfavorable cases, make access to society considerably more difficult.
Here we want to continue to provide more help for self-help, so that the individual can free himself from external constraints.
This is also why, for example, we have increased funding for integration courses,
further increased funding for the expansion of childcare in the states
, and supported initiatives for language and vocational training.
We want to open the doors to our society for those who want to enter.
This applies to all those who already live in our country.
And that goes for those who still want to come.
That is why we have made it easier to immigrate to Germany and improved the recognition of foreign educational qualifications, so that bright minds can find their way to Germany more easily.
But for these people to come to Germany, they must first and foremost be welcome in Germany and be able to find a home here with their families.
Tolerance, openness, a culture of togetherness - these are values in themselves for liberals.
In the modern world, however, these are also indispensable location factors if we want to remain at the forefront of business, research and creative ventures.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Germany is a country of immigration.
- We are delighted about that.
- In the past, immigrants have helped shape the economic miracle and enriched our society.
- However, living together in an open society requires everyone involved to strive for common ground, tolerance and acceptance.
- Integration is impossible without a common language and acceptance of the republican values of our constitution.
- This is why we want to further strengthen integration courses as a central element and, in particular, focus more on the early integration of children.
- The integration courses are also to be extended to tolerated persons and asylum seekers.
- They have often been in Germany for years and must therefore be given the opportunity to learn German in order to be able to participate in working and social life.
- 
- We want immigration law that gives skilled workers a chance on the labor market.
- Germany should be open to talented people from all over the world, establish a welcoming culture and actively and concretely woo bright minds.
- We want to continue the liberalization of immigration of skilled workers and the introduction of modern immigration law.
- To this end, we are striving to further develop the work search visa into a clear and complete points system based on the model of Canada and Australia.
- Along the way, we also want to further lower the existing salary limits for immigration and reduce initial language barriers.
- To this end, English is to be promoted and established as a supplementary language of communication and work in areas of public administration relevant to targeted immigration, independently of the medium- to long-term promotion of German as a foreign language.
- In addition, the work permit requirement is to be waived for legal residents.
- Analogous to the regulation for students who come to Germany to study, trainees from third countries who want to complete an apprenticeship in Germany should also receive a residence title.
- 
- Integration also requires a society's openness and willingness to integrate.
- As liberals, we campaign for more openness and tolerance.
- We want the possibility of accelerated naturalization after four years and the fundamental admission of dual citizenship. -
Opportunities for participation facilitate integration:
- therefore, with a legal minimum stay of five years, we advocate the introduction of a municipal right to vote for foreigners.
- 
- We want to recruit qualified personnel with an immigrant background for the public sector.
- After all, it is important for integration and for our society that people with intercultural competence work in the public sector, in daycare centers and schools.
- These role models have a positive influence on children and young people in particular.
- 
o Language is the key to education, success, and social integration.
o It is therefore the state's duty of care to ensure that no child is left behind.
o Language proficiency testing for all children at age four is a prerequisite for ensuring that everyone has the same opportunities.
o If needed, targeted language support before school and language programs that accompany instruction beyond that are necessary.
o 
- We want to increasingly educate and empower parents to support their children.
- Programs for combined language support for parents and children are showing exemplary success.
- Programs for children are often the best starting point for parents to catch up on integration.
- 
- It took a long time for our society to realize that Germany is a country of immigration.
- It was too late that a genuine offer was made to the new fellow citizens and an open integration policy was pursued.
- Catching up on integration is therefore an important and challenging task for society and politics.
- Here we are particularly called upon to help those migrants, some of whom have been in the country for decades, along in the integration process and not to give them up.
- To this end, we are relying above all on education and labor market policy instruments.
- 
- We seek and demand open dialogue with all population groups and religious communities.
- All religious associations and institutes are called upon to open themselves in principle to the entire German-speaking population.
- We advocate the increased establishment of chairs for Islamic theology at German universities, the training of German-speaking imams and Muslim religious teachers.
- We want to create an academy for Islamic studies, which will advise public authorities in Germany and promote the training of Muslim clergy and religious teachers in Germany.
- 
- Muslims are part of German society.
- This must also be reflected in school instruction.
- It must become a matter of course that confession-oriented Islamic religious instruction is given in German at schools, provided that religious instruction is generally given at state schools and that it is embedded in the value system of the Basic Law.
- 
- We advocate that visa issuance be handled more generously and flexibly.
- Foreigners' authorities and embassies should also not see themselves as defensive authorities, but rather act as Germany's figureheads.
- Germany is a country open to the world.
- Not least for its good economy, the flexible exchange of employees and business travelers is essential.
- 
- Germany has supported efforts to improve refugee protection at the international level over the past decades and is one of UNHCR's ten main donor countries.
- We are committed to continuing UNHCR's resettlement program beyond 2014.
- 
- Asylum seekers should be allowed to work from the first day of their legal stay.
- It is in line with the liberal self-image that people are not forced to claim state benefits, but that they have the opportunity to earn their own living.
- 
- We have created a right of residence for young people and adolescents that is independent of the cut-off date and from which their parents can also benefit.
- Now, in coordination with the federal states, a general solution must be found for the many thousands of people who have already been living in Germany for years and are likely to remain here because there is no foreseeable lifting of their toleration.
- We want to abolish chain tolerations.
- 
Culture and media as a mirror of diversity - culture by all, culture for all
To enable more people in Germany to follow their path and pursue their dreams, opportunities must be identified before they can be seized.
One prerequisite for this is a vibrant, free and diverse cultural life in Germany.
Art and culture are the social foundations for understanding each other and a source of identity and creativity.
They reflect the state of a society and drive its development.
Without art and culture, life would lose its diversity, our society would not be creative, our education would be technocratic, and our economy would not be innovative.
Liberal cultural and media policy lays the foundation for more people to have more opportunities in the future.
It promotes social participation, integration, equal opportunities and personal development for people of all ages and backgrounds.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We consistently apply the principle of "culture by all, culture for all".
- That is why we want to enshrine culture as a national objective in the German constitution.
- Liberal cultural policy focuses on citizens as creators, promoters and recipients of art and culture.
- Cultural initiatives, associations, independent organizations, foundations and companies therefore have our support as providers of culture and cultural education.
- The promotion of cultural institutions in rural areas is also of particular importance.
- We are expressly committed to public cultural funding.
- Promoting culture is not a subsidy, but an investment in the future of our country.
- The arts need support in order to develop freely, because the new and original is often found beyond self-sustaining marketing.
- We expressly welcome it when public, private and independent cultural organizations open up to each other and form joint networks.
- 
- Public and publicly funded cultural creativity is a reflection of the diversity in our country.
- Germany is a country with a rich and diverse cultural offering and intellectual life that makes an indispensable contribution to the vitality and strength of our society.
- We want to further strengthen this strength and diversity.
- 
- Germany's cultural diversity is shaped and enriched by intercultural exchange and contact in our country
- just as it is by exchange with our international partners.
- Liberal cultural policy does not end at ethnic, religious or national borders, but is expressly committed to promoting intercultural contact in the arts and sciences.
- 
- Cultural education defines the future viability of our society.
- It is the task of both our educational and cultural institutions.
- A cultural nation like Germany should familiarize all people with cultural offerings in a targeted manner.
- This includes, in particular, the teaching of media skills.
- The cultural and creative industries are an important driver of innovation, and we want to see more recognition given to their contribution.
- We want to ensure that self-employed people and companies in the cultural and creative industries have better access to outside capital and will support companies in opening up foreign markets.
- We support cooperation between business and politics on the German Computer Game Prize and film funding.
- 
o Cultural and creative industries are inconceivable without the protection of intellectual property.
o Violations of intellectual property on the Internet should be combated just as consistently and effectively as violations of copyright in the analog world.
o Existing legal uncertainties in a digitized world must be eliminated by a modern copyright law. o
This must fairly balance the interests of authors and rights holders as well as users and service providers.
o At the same time, it must enable uncensored communication, the free flow of information, and access to knowledge and innovations.
o 
- Our democracy thrives on diversity of media and opinion in the analog and digital worlds.
- In both worlds, a fair coexistence of print media and broadcasting must be ensured.
- This also rules out fee-subsidized market distortion.
- In order not to put broadcasting and the press at a disadvantage compared to providers on the Internet, modernization of media concentration and antitrust law is necessary.
- We call for a review and specification of the public broadcaster's basic service mandate.
- Financing should be based on this basic service mandate, no more and no less.
- 
- The new residential fee for broadcasting and the contribution service as successor to the GEZ are to be abolished and replaced by a personal fee.
- This is to be collected by the tax office together with income tax and is to be significantly lower than the current broadcasting fee.
- Exemptions from the fee on the grounds of social hardship or disability are to be reintroduced.
- Additional revenues from the switch to the contribution service must be repaid to broadcasting subscribers in the following year by reducing contributions.
- In addition, public broadcasting must concentrate on its core tasks and a narrowly defined educational mission.
- The number of public broadcasting stations in Germany should therefore be significantly reduced.
- We want to adapt the existing supervision of our broadcast media to the media policy reality of the networking of broadcasting, the Internet and telecommunications.
- 
- The social insurance for artists is one of the main pillars of social security for many creative people.
- We Liberals are in favor of reforming the social insurance for artists.
- In particular, it should be prevented in the future that contributions are paid for artistic services if the providers of the service are not members of the artists' social insurance at all.
- In addition, the measures to improve the social situation of artists must be stabilized or readjusted as necessary.
- 
Germany as a tourist destination
Germany is becoming increasingly popular as a travel destination - among both domestic and foreign guests.
More and more people are working longer hours and short vacations are increasingly being booked instead of long vacations.
A solid tourist infrastructure, also outside the large metropolises, ensures a relaxing vacation in the area.
The metropolises of Hamburg, Berlin and Munich are magnets for tourists, but the "classic" sights, such as the UNESCO natural and cultural heritage sites, are also beacons of tourist marketing.
Cultural tourism is an important factor for the preservation of German cultural assets.
Old towns, castles and palaces are strengthened by tourism.
Tourism revenue provides funds to maintain the substance, so that the cultural assets can be preserved as a focal point for tourists.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
o We want to continue the successful development of German tourism and thus strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises.
o The position of the GNTB (German National Tourist Board) is to be strengthened and international marketing intensified in order to raise the profile of Germany and its diverse regions abroad through targeted, joint measures.
o 
- Tourism in rural areas should continue to be strengthened.
- It offers added value and prospects, especially in economically difficult regions.
- 
- German waterways are to be further developed for tourist use.
- Environmental protection and tourism are not mutually exclusive, but can be combined.
- Nature-based tourism in particular offers great opportunities here.
- 
IV. Freedom, so that everyone can go their own way
More freedom allows people to go their own way.
The law therefore has the task of creating a framework that protects the freedom of the individual, promotes individual initiative and uses state coercion only where it is absolutely necessary.
This guiding principle is embodied in the principle of the liberal constitutional state, which underlies our domestic and legal policy.
The principle of the liberal constitutional state rejects superfluous interventions and controls, which bully and patronize citizens but create neither security nor freedom.
Therefore, fundamental rights form a central pillar of the liberal constitutional state.
They act as a strong barrier to freedom.
We continue to expand and defend this wall.
For us, the following applies: When in doubt, go for freedom.
The liberal constitutional state provides a framework that citizens fill through their creativity and inventiveness.
We want to develop this creativity not only in the private sector, but also for the public sector.
Therefore, the principle of the liberal constitutional state also stands for a further development of our proven democratic institutions.
We want to open up political co-determination beyond elections and protest.
Fundamental rights in the digital world
Modern communication technologies, global networking through the Internet and the rapid exchange of data and information open up previously undreamed-of opportunities for every individual to develop.
Digitization creates more freedom for more people to connect, participate and create according to their own needs and desires.
It changes the reality of state, economy and society.
The information society thus also poses new challenges for the law.
For us liberals, fundamental rights must be respected both online and offline, because freedom cannot be defended by giving it up.
We have already achieved a number of things along the way:
we have removed "network blocks" from the Federal Law Gazette and enforced the principle of "deletion instead of blocking,"
abolished mass data collection for the electronic remuneration statement (ELENA),
and rejected the storage and analysis of all telecommunications data of all citizens without any reason, i.e., data retention.
With the Data Protection Foundation, we have taken an important step toward modern data protection.
We have already taken precautionary measures to safeguard network neutrality in the Telecommunications Act.
In shaping the opportunities of the information society, we rely on self-determined and enlightened users who are able to make their own decisions.
These decisions must not be taken from him - regardless of which side.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- The linking and publication of data on the Internet is creating a new digital public sphere with a wide range of opportunities.
- However, there is also the threat of new dangers, for example if data left behind on the Internet is used in social networks without the knowledge and will of the person concerned to create behavior, usage or movement profiles, or if there are serious infringements of personal rights.
- We therefore want to strengthen personal rights, and in particular provide better protection against serious interference
- while maintaining the openness to development and technological neutrality of the legal system ("red line for social networks").
- Terms of use must be formulated in such a way that users understand them.
- 
- We want to further improve the protection of private data and strengthen the independence of the data protection commissioner.
- In the future, responsibility for data protection should lie with the Federal Ministry of Justice.
- We are committed to ensuring a high level of protection in the future EU Data Protection Regulation.
- We want to create modern, technology-proof data privacy law that does justice to the great importance of data privacy in the digital world, and preserve sector-specific data privacy.
- However, data privacy and freedom of the press should not be played off against each other.
- In the social sphere, we are focusing on the responsible citizen and want to strengthen self-data protection and data privacy through technology.
- The use of RFID chips to improve logistics, for example, must not become a data protection trap for consumers.
- RFID chips on goods - such as clothing - must be completely and permanently deactivated at the checkout.
- We want to improve data protection in the workplace through an Employee Data Protection Act and create legal certainty for companies and employees.
- 
- We continue to oppose data retention without any reason.
- People in Germany must not be placed under blanket suspicion and monitored without cause when making mobile phone calls, sending text messages or surfing the Internet.
- Germany is a safe country even without data retention.
- The powers of the police already ensure high detection rates.
- Where it seems absolutely necessary, we advocate an alternative to data retention that does not infringe fundamental rights.
- In individual cases, existing data should be retained in the event of concrete suspicions - i.e., not without reason - and then used for investigative purposes after a judicial decision if the suspicion is substantiated.
- When eCall is introduced, it must be ensured that this can be switched off and is done exclusively on a voluntary basis.
- We will insist to the European Commission that the failed Data Retention Directive be measured against the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and fundamentally revised.
- Until then, we will continue to advocate before the European Court of Justice that there be no judgment in the infringement proceedings against Germany before the Court has given its opinion on the compatibility of the Data Retention Directive with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
- Any call to tighten the European Data Retention Directive, for example to communications data from social networks, as currently being considered by the EU Commission, will meet with our resistance in Germany and Europe.
- 
- We reject projects that result in the complete and comprehensive monitoring of our society in all areas of life.
- For example, we oppose the continuation and implementation of the INDECT project, which is being promoted at the EU level and is intended to automatically examine behavioral patterns in the public sphere for deviations from the norm in order to identify conspicuous behavior.
- For liberals, it is out of the question that algorithms should determine what is and what is not "normal behavior" in a society and that encroachments on freedom should be linked to this "statistical understanding of normality".
- The focus of our thoughts and actions is on people in their individuality and their right to be different.
- 
- We reject the idea of further data retention, such as the storage of airline passenger data without any reason or the comprehensive recording of all border crossings in Europe.
- Recording the everyday behavior of innocent citizens places everyone under general suspicion and is incompatible with human dignity.
- Where there is constant surveillance, there can be no free development.
- 
- We will continue to advocate that data traffic on the net be free in the future.
- People in Germany should not have to put up with all their data on the Internet being monitored and analyzed by the government.
- Net neutrality is recognized as a fundamental principle of telecommunications regulation.
- This means that there must be no discrimination against individual offerings within a class of service.
- Equal must also be treated equally.
- 
Modern law for a modern society
Law must absorb and shape social changes - and always respect fundamental rights.
The Basic Law is the value framework of our coexistence.
As the world changes, so must the law if it is not to appear backward-looking.
A modern society demands modern law.
Globalization, technological development and changes in social reality, such as more open family images, offer many new opportunities, but also present us with new challenges in data protection, copyright, family law or respect for civil rights.
Therefore, we have created more individual freedom by initiating a return to a fundamental rights-oriented legal policy.
For the first time in decades, there are no new security laws and the September 11, 2001 anti-terrorism laws have been defunded and given rule of law controls.
Civil rights have been strengthened by legislation in a wide range of areas, from freedom of the press to better protection of lawyers from surveillance.
We have supported the diverse reality of life through numerous reforms, for example in family law.
To protect property, we have fought rental nomadism by strengthening the rights of small landlords in the housing market inside and outside the judicial process.
We protect people's freedom from a regulation-minded state.
We do not want a suspicious state that places all citizens under general suspicion.
We want a republic of free citizens and a policy for the rights and freedom of the people in our country.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
o In Germany, telecommunications may only be monitored within narrow legal limits, to a proportionate extent and with clear legal protection options.
o We want this boundary to be maintained in the future.
o The ever-increasing number of telecommunications interceptions gives rise to a review of whether constitutional safeguards are effectively anchored and also prove their worth in everyday law enforcement to protect civil rights.
o 
- We are committed to closely monitoring the practice of so-called radio cell interceptions and, if necessary, to legally concretizing the legal requirements for the principle of proportionality.
- Under no circumstances should there be uncontrolled mass interceptions - for example, at gatherings protected by fundamental rights.
- 
- We want to strengthen people's rights in voluntary DNA screening.
- Otherwise, the right to refuse to testify could be undermined.
- That is why we will expand the duty to instruct and make further procedural safeguards a prerequisite for such screening.
- 
- We want to provide greater protection for the core area of private life.
- We reject the inclusion of a so-called spying attack in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
- The so-called "grand eavesdropping attack" must be put to the test against the background of the case law of the Federal Constitutional Court and with regard to its usefulness in successfully fighting crime.
- 
- The "deal" in criminal proceedings must be reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Constitutional Court.
- If this review shows that the principles of fair trial and punishment appropriate to guilt cannot be sufficiently ensured, the "deal" must be excluded by law if necessary.
- 
- Furthermore, we want to further strengthen the protection of professional secrecy holders - for example, doctors, lawyers, clergy, social workers - and review the Code of Criminal Procedure to determine whether other professional secrecy holders should enjoy absolute protection.
- 
- In criminal proceedings, gentle treatment of victims of violence must become a matter of course.
- Civil courage is a necessary prerequisite for civil society.
- The state should therefore reward more strongly the commitment and dedication of citizens who stand in the way of criminals in order to help victims.
- We also want to help victims of miscarriages of justice better.
- We therefore support the introduction of a corresponding contact point.
- 
- We are committed to a modern family and inheritance law that expands the disposition options of citizens. - For
us, this includes more testamentary freedom for the testator
- as well as the additional matrimonial property regime of the so-called community of inheritance for spouses and registered partners.
- We want to adapt family and inheritance law to the realities of modern reproductive medicine (for example, sperm donation).
- 
- We continue to advocate the European private company, i.e. the Europa-GmbH, in order to provide German SMEs, which are strong exporters, with a legal form that allows them to operate cost-effectively throughout Europe.
- 
- An efficient and independent judiciary is indispensable for a liberal constitutional state.
- To strengthen the self-administration of the judiciary, the state judicial administration's right to issue external directives to the public prosecutors' offices must be abolished in order to prevent any appearance of political influence on the judiciary.
- It is also necessary to shorten the length of proceedings before the courts.
- We want to make the judiciary fit for the modern information society and globalization.
- In the future, it should also be possible to conduct proceedings in English before the chambers for commercial law.
- We want to expand international legal cooperation in the field of legal exports with emerging and transition countries.
- 
- In order to ensure greater legal certainty regarding the question of what the state can be held liable for, we advocate the introduction of a state liability law.
- 
- We want to modernize copyright law so that it fairly balances the interests of authors, rights holders and users and enables access to knowledge and innovation.
- Only if it is clear who owns which intellectual achievement can people respect this ownership relationship, build fair trade relationships on it and develop new business models with it.
- We reject calls for surveillance and censorship of Internet traffic to enforce economic interests.
- We reject the so-called "three strikes" solution, according to which citizens are to be deprived of access to the Internet, because it is disproportionate.
- We want to strengthen international cooperation and make it more transparent so that we can stand up to portals with content that clearly infringes copyright and whose servers are located in third countries.
- Illegal content should be combated in a targeted manner and must no longer be lucrative for operators.
- 
- Copyright law in the information society must be open to new technologies and allow different licensing models to coexist without discrimination.
- We want to safeguard the freedom of choice of authors as to how they wish to market their works and shape the legal framework of copyright law in such a way that it remains open to creative exploitation models.
- 
- Researchers and scientists should continue to be able to decide for themselves whether their works and contributions are freely accessible or whether they are licensed.
- This also applies to publicly funded research projects.
- This freedom to decide how their own works are used must not be taken away by legal regulations.
- Only with the incentive of all possibilities of development can research continue beyond public funding.
- However, in the case of publicly funded research, we advocate funding guidelines that generally aim to publish the results, provided that there are no compelling interests to the contrary.
- 
- In copyright law, it must be clarified that a private copy is permissible regardless of technical copy protection if the purchaser has previously acquired the work and the private copy is made solely for personal use, such as for data backup or for playback on another playback device.
- The technical means for the use of the work in accordance with the copyright are to be provided by the copyright holder.
- 
- Account searches in various areas of law should be reduced to the absolute minimum required.
- Account searches should only be carried out if there are actual indications of tax evasion, social fraud or significant criminal offenses.
- In the same way as inventory data is queried, those affected by account queries should also be informed subsequently.
- 
- The criminal liability gap in the area of data theft must be closed.
- Not only the obtaining and unauthorized use of data must be punished, but also the dissemination of illegally obtained data.
- We therefore advocate the inclusion of the criminal offense of data theft in the Criminal Code.
- 
- We Liberals stand for a legal development that does not level legal digital business models and the free flow of data and information.
- We therefore advocate, among other things, a change in operator liability in order to create more legal certainty for WLAN operators.
More freedom - liberal domestic policy
People in our country should be able to go their own way and develop freely.
But they must also have the space for the search for personal happiness.
That is why defending the individual's rights to freedom from encroachment by the state or third parties is our top priority.
We have kept our word and put an end to the staccato of ever new security laws.
To this end, we achieved a balance between freedom and security in the extension of the Counter-Terrorism Amendment Act.
In the process, regulations that have proven to be dispensable were deleted without replacement, and safeguards based on the rule of law were withdrawn.
The remaining regulations were again limited to four years and provided with significant improvements in the rule of law control and the protection of fundamental rights.
We have resolutely pursued the investigation of the NSU murders.
Our goal remains to create more freedom for people in Germany.
More freedom to go your own way.
We are staying the course.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to strengthen and revitalize democracy in our country.
- In a mature democracy, citizens should also have a direct influence on political decision-making beyond elections.
- We are committed to opening up and strengthening representative democracy.
- We want to create an appropriate basis for this by introducing the citizens' plenary procedure, an optional legislative referendum and the constitutional anchoring of popular initiatives, petitions and referendums.
- 
- New media open up new opportunities for citizen participation and lower the hurdles to the common perception of interests in our society.
- We want to use these opportunities to complement our representative democracy.
- Information offerings on the Internet open up new opportunities for interaction between people and politics.
- 
- Open data refers to the free availability and usability of data.
- In public administration and in public companies, there is a large amount of data that does not need to be specially protected for reasons of data protection or copyright, but can be made available for use and further processing.
- We advocate the continuation and expansion of existing public open data offerings.
- As much data as possible from public administration and public companies should be made available there in machine-readable form and using an open license, in order to enable the use of data and innovations.
- The widespread use of the Internet also offers opportunities for better citizen participation in Germany.
- We are committed to expanding digital communication channels and, where necessary, creating new channels to complement existing offerings.
- In the area of e-government, citizens should thus be better informed and be able to communicate more easily with government agencies.
- The long-term goal is to enable participation via modern communication channels as well, so that citizens can take part in political debates on a daily basis.
- 
- Democracy begins in our cities and communities. -
That's why we want to strengthen the self-determination of municipalities through comprehensive municipal finance reform
- and at the same time advocate greater transparency and participation in municipal decision-making.
- We want municipal voting rights for third-country nationals.
- 
- A functioning civil service is an important pillar of our democratic constitutional state.
- We are committed to the civil service because it offers advantages for the fulfillment of sovereign tasks, including, for example, special duties of loyalty and the prohibition of strikes by civil servants.
- We advocate improvements in the transfer of acquired pension rights, greater flexibility in retirement and a strengthening of the concept of performance.
- In career law, the completion of a station with a European or international organization is to be weighted much more heavily than before.
- 
- We want a defensible democracy that is armed against all extremist threats.
- Terrorism and extremism must continue to be combated and prosecuted consistently.
- We will therefore advocate the expansion and greater coordination of deradicalization programs.
- Where interventions in civil rights are necessary, they must always be justified and proportionate.
- That is why we want to continuously review the current security laws to ensure that they are appropriate.
- 
- In the police sector, too, the core area of private life needs stronger protection.
- To this end, the BKA Act in particular needs to be put to the test.
- We consider the instrument of secret online searches to be neither necessary nor suitable, but rather see it as too far-reaching an encroachment on fundamental rights, allowing comprehensive access to virtually every area of the life of the person concerned.
- 
- In order to further improve security in and around soccer stadiums, we Liberals are counting on the consistent implementation of the National Concept for Sport and Security (NKSS) and the ten-point plan for greater security in soccer.
- Clubs and associations, together with the fan projects, are doing outstanding social work in this area.
- To reduce violence at sporting events, we believe that preventive approaches, a permanent dialog between all stakeholders and consistent law enforcement make more sense than building up threatening backdrops from the ranks of the state interior ministers.
- Civil rights also apply in sports.
- We oppose disproportionate encroachments on fundamental rights against soccer fans.
- 
- Protecting the freedom of the individual is the task of the state.
- The security authorities in Germany make an outstanding contribution every day to safeguarding people's freedom and the rule of law.
- Above all, police officers stand for law and order like hardly any other professional group.
- To ensure that the excellent work of the police can continue in the future, Germany needs a sensible security architecture consisting of authorities with good staffing and material resources.
- 
- Police in Germany is and remains first and foremost a matter for the states.
- In a federal security architecture, however, cooperation and the exchange of information between all authorities are essential.
- To further improve this, we want to create the legal basis for joint police cooperation centers and thus safeguard their function and control under the rule of law.
- To ensure efficient prosecution of anti-constitutional organizations and individuals, we support the merging of individual state offices for the protection of the constitution and want to strengthen cooperation among the state offices for the protection of the constitution.
- 
- At the federal level, too, we want to adapt the security architecture to the requirements of the times. -
However, we fundamentally reject any expansion of the federal government's police and intelligence competencies
- just as we reject the deployment of the Bundeswehr in the interior.
- Unclear responsibilities and duplications must be eliminated.
- The police and intelligence services should concentrate on their core tasks.
- We oppose the increasing diminution of the police to intelligence services, as well as the expansion of the intelligence services' responsibilities into the area of danger prevention.
- We support the federal order in the area of security authorities and at the same time want a return to the areas of competence of the security authorities, both between the federal and state governments and between the police and intelligence services.
- In the future, the tasks of the Military Counter-Intelligence Service are to be performed by the Bundeswehr and the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
- We want to unite the fragmented structures for securing our coasts in a national coast guard.
- 
o Digital attacks on public institutions or companies, such as energy or water suppliers, on infrastructures such as transport companies or on financial institutions, can fundamentally impair the functioning of our society or bring it to a standstill.
o We want to strengthen Germany's ability to effectively resist such threats and arm all areas of public life against digitally led attacks.
o However, IT security is not primarily the responsibility of the state, but of companies, users and providers.
o We believe that it is primarily the responsibility of industry to meet its responsibility for the information society by investing in IT security and jointly agreed standards for data security and protection mechanisms.
o 
- We want to ensure comprehensive parliamentary control over the intelligence services.
- Members of the Parliamentary Control Committee must be granted unannounced access to the services, information and documents at any time, insofar as this is necessary for control purposes.
- Employees of the services shall be able to be summoned by the committee at any time with a qualified one-quarter majority.
- The work of the committee is to be supported by the appointment of a permanent expert who, among other things, supports the work of investigative committees as an investigator.
- The committee is to be informed every six months by the federal government about the use of undercover agents.
- 
- Illegal possession of weapons is a threat to the safety of citizens.
- That is why we are committed to consistently prosecuting illegal weapons possession.
- We advocate a continuous, scientifically supported review of the current weapons law; the suspicion-independent controls should also be put to the test.
- We reject any further tightening of current gun laws.
- The introduction of a weapons tax and the central storage of hunting and sporting weapons do not serve safety and are therefore rejected by us.
- 
- Extremism prevention programs are and remain a central building block for a defensible democracy.
- They strengthen our democratic state from within and help immunize people against extremist ideas and ideologies that are incompatible with our constitution.
- These programs must be evaluated regularly.
- 
- Remembering the two German dictatorships, their victims, their perpetrators and the resistance against them is a task for society as a whole.
- Fortunately, the younger generation only knows about the lack of freedom, state terror and disenfranchisement in Germany from history books.
- The history of Germany's dictatorship must be used to further sensitize young people in particular to the value of freedom, the rule of law and humanity.
- We strengthen our democratic political culture by reappraising, remembering, and educating, and thus remain capable of making judgments.
- Extremism must not be tolerated or excused - regardless of whether it is left-wing, right-wing or religiously motivated.
- 
Transparency and information - for fair competition
For liberals, thinking from the consumer's point of view is a core task.
Because consumer policy combines the traditions of a wise economic policy with a liberal civil rights policy.
Liberal consumer policy therefore focuses on strengthening the consumer in the market.
We ensure that consumers are empowered to make their own choices through transparency and information about services and products.
Our consumer policy enables and encourages self-determined choices.
Liberal consumer policy opposes political paternalism through forms of consumer control.
That is why we reject an expansion of advertising bans or the introduction of specific consumption taxes.
We close loopholes for fraudsters and rip-off artists.
Because efficient consumer protection is economic policy for everyone.
A functioning market economy needs market participants to trust each other.
That is why efficient liberal consumer protection defends the honest entrepreneurs against the "windy" ones.
In the event of a dispute, we make it easier for consumers to enforce their rights.
With this in mind, we have, for example, made the free telephone waiting loop mandatory for service hotlines in recent years.
We have introduced a price announcement requirement for call-by-call telephony, thus ensuring transparency of offers.
When contracts are concluded on the Internet, all costs incurred must now be clearly listed for consumers before the contract is concluded and confirmed by the consumer (Internet button).
We have improved the rights of airline passengers by setting up an air transport conciliation body to resolve disputes with providers centrally and cost-effectively.
In this way, we have improved the information available to consumers, curbed dubious business models and strengthened consumers' rights.
We want to continue along this path of efficient consumer protection.
The recent food scandals in particular - which we are committed to resolutely investigating - show that effective consumer protection must also be European consumer protection.
That is why we Liberals are committed to ensuring that we do not cut any corners in Europe and that a high level of consumer protection is guaranteed in the European single market.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to combat the planned "obsolescence" of technical devices more effectively.
- Technical standards are intended to ensure, for example, the interchangeability of batteries and the non-destructive opening of devices above a certain device value.
- On a subsidiary basis, we are also seeking EU-wide solutions and consideration of the problem in international trade agreements.
- 
- Consumer education must start at an early stage - at home, in kindergarten and at school.
- We want schools to teach economic issues in particular more intensively than they have in the past.
- Consumer education should therefore be anchored in the curricula as an essential component.
- But ongoing consumer education is also of the utmost importance.
- We therefore advocate the provision of advice, events and information brochures by consumer centers or other consumer associations, as well as information and comparative studies on products and services by the media and independent organizations such as Stiftung Warentest.
- In view of their importance, support for these offerings by the federal and state governments must continue to be secured in the future and, if necessary, expanded.
- 
- In the area of telephone service hotlines, we want to align call charges from mobile communications with those from the fixed network.
- For directory assistance services, we want to introduce price transparency through a mandatory price announcement before the start of the charge.
- 
- Due to different business models, telecommunications companies as providers sometimes offer a connection to the Internet with significant restrictions.
- Volume tariffs, i.e., a limit on transmitted data volumes, must be clearly designated as such in order to enable the citizen to make a transparent decision and thus strengthen competition.
- 
- The current food scandals show more than clearly that food controls in Germany are not functioning optimally.
- We want to ensure that food inspections are adequately staffed.
- What is needed is the introduction of nationwide standards for food inspection, the establishment of focal prosecution offices and improved exchange between the states.
- Extensive use must be made of the existing sanction options in the event of violations of food law.
- We will review these instruments for their effectiveness.
- In addition, we want to supplement the existing structure of official controls with special units spanning several federal states, especially for wholesalers.
- Product-, sector- and company-specific expertise could thus strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of controls and relieve the burden on local authorities.
- 
- The origin of food is important to more and more consumers in their purchasing decisions.
- Already today, many retailers voluntarily rely on origin labeling, even if this is not legally binding.
- We Liberals expressly support this approach and appeal to the business community to further expand this labeling and make it accessible to consumers as a matter of principle, insofar as this is possible and sensible according to the type and composition of the food.
- 
- Genetically modified organisms are already used today in many manufacturing processes to the benefit of consumers, for example in the production of pharmaceuticals.
- However, every consumer should be completely free to decide whether he or she wants to use these products - just as he or she would otherwise.
- We therefore advocate the labeling of such foods so that this decision can be made in the first place.
- At the same time, we attach importance to scientific and objective information and consumer education about the benefits and value of modern production methods.
- 
- Luxury foods that are freely saleable and legally tradable must not be forced off the market by advertising bans and trade restrictions.
- Such paternalism of consumers cannot be reconciled with the concept of the responsible citizen.
- We fundamentally reject such interference in the market economy and in the decisions of responsible consumers.
- However, the protection of minors in the case of tobacco and alcohol must be strictly guaranteed.
- The food service industry also depends on the trust of its customers.
- It is in everyone's interest to secure this trust through high quality standards.
- However, quality assurance and control by state authorities must remain proportionate.
- 
- The holder of a travel business card has proven to the competent regulatory authority that there is no doubt about his personal reliability.
- He legally offers the services specified in the travel business card.
- Therefore, he may no longer be restricted in advertising, submitting offers and accepting orders.
- 
- We want financial services to be more transparent and easier for customers to understand, and financial products to be more comparable.
- This is the only way we can enable investors to make an informed choice.
- To this end, we want to standardize product information sheets and also specify a classification of financial products into binding risk classes in the product information sheets.
- 
- We will further strengthen passenger rights.
- To ensure that compensation for delays is effective throughout the passenger transport sector, punctuality must be worthwhile for the companies.
- We therefore want to oblige Deutsche Bahn to compensate passengers with 25% of the travel price for delays of 30 minutes or more and 50% of the travel price for delays of 60 minutes or more.
- 
- We are committed to making children's toys safer.
- The limits for PAHs, heavy metals and allergenic fragrances set out in the EU Toys Directive are not sufficient to ensure effective health protection.
- We are therefore pushing for improved standards to protect our children.
- That is why we want to lower the limits for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, etc.) compared with the current version of the EU Toys Directive.
- We also aim to tighten the material requirements for liquid and pasty toy materials and align them with the specifications for cosmetic products.
- 
- Consumers need significantly more legal certainty against the abuse of warning letters.
- To this end, a cap on warning fees is an important signal.
- Unjustified or excessive warning letters have become a business model. -
We want to do more to curb these dubious business practices
- and at the same time enforce copyright law.
- We therefore want to cap the amount in dispute for injunctive relief or removal for a one-time infringement in the non-commercial sector at 1000 euros.
- 
V. Progress so that our country wins the future
Dreams and ideas are the raw material from which we have derived our prosperity.
Out-of-the-box thinkers, researchers and entrepreneurs who pursued an idea, realized a dream and created innovation and progress have laid the foundation for our country's growth and advancement.
Continuing to give these people opportunities to pursue their ideas is a common sense imperative.
Because only with the courage to do something new and with the joy of change will we win the future.
For liberals, however, freedom of the mind and freedom of research is much more:
it is a human right.
That is why we are working hard to ensure that we in Germany do not miss out on the future out of fear of the new - and lose or drive away those on whose dreams and ideas our country lives.
That is why - even in times of budget consolidation - we have increased investment in education and research to almost 14 billion euros
and put a stop to progress with the Freedom of Science Act.
We will not overcome the challenges of our time through laws and prohibitions, but only through growth and progress.
This is particularly true for the tasks ahead of us in climate and environmental protection.
As an exporter of ideas and innovations, we help to save energy and resources, avoid emissions and increase people's quality of life and prosperity.
We want to continue to be one of the innovation drivers for the development of the world.
We also need the necessary infrastructure in Germany:
modern research facilities and production plants,
Electricity grids,
efficient systems for renewable and conventional energy,
fast, nationwide Internet access.
Modern transport routes and a comprehensive, affordable mobility offer are essential for a progressive republic of free citizens.
Progress means growth.
But that doesn't mean more and more of the same.
Rather, growth through progress means above all better goods, more efficient production and more attractive services.
It means not only consuming less, but using more intelligently.
Growth through progress therefore means sustainable growth - in the environment, the economy and social interaction.
Sustainable development does not necessarily mean doing without.
It's not just about using less, it's about using smarter.
It's not just about throwing away less, it's about reusing more.
Using resources efficiently and in the sense of a circular economy requires technological innovations and intelligent utilization concepts.
Those who learn to think in terms of interrelationships and interactions develop a sense of possibility and discover opportunities for innovation.
Disadvantages can turn out to be advantages and the waste of one product is resources for another good.
New technologies and solutions should therefore not be judged primarily on the basis of whether they mitigate individual negative consequences of today's economic activity, but whether they lead to overall improvements and positive interactions of economic, social and ecological aspects.
An expanded, systemic view of the value chain that focuses on technology, innovation and holistic solutions generates sustainable, responsible and systemically intelligent growth.
Winning the future - new knowledge through research and development
The people in this country have laid the foundation for Germany's success story in recent years.
These people have made an effort.
Out of responsibility for themselves, for their families, their colleagues, employees and fellow citizens.
They created growth and progress because they had the freedom to do so - and used it.
We want to continue to give people the freedom to pursue their ideas - creating growth, progress and prosperity for all.
With the Freedom of Science Act, we have given science and industry alike more freedom, broken down barriers and brought research and teaching closer together again.
We have invested almost 14 billion euros more in education and research.
After all, knowledge is our country's most important raw material.
If we care for it appropriately, we will never run out of it and it will remain high quality.
Knowledge creates new things and knowledge makes you want new things.
We must not sleep through the future out of fear of the new.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We want to further increase the number of researching and innovative companies and expand our leading position as the world champion of technology exports.
- We create the political and institutional framework conditions so that science can realize its own research approaches and creativity, curiosity and the spirit of research can flourish.
- Among other things, we want to harmonize norms, standards and technical regulations worldwide.
- 
- We are creating the conditions to ensure that the share of spending on research and development, which is already well above the EU average, will continue to rise in the coming years.
- In the context of budget consolidation, we want to invest in strategically necessary research and growth areas and introduce tax incentives for research.
- 
o We want to provide small and medium-sized companies with their own cutting-edge research with an unbureaucratic and accelerated access to technology-specific funding for research and development.
o We want to provide more support for start-ups based on research and science.
o In Germany, the land of ideas, new products and technologies should not only be developed, but also produced and applied.
o 
o Consequently, we want to continue and further develop the EXIST program.
o To close the financing gaps in the early stages of innovative companies, we are committed to improving the framework conditions for private venture capital.
o 
- With the Freedom of Science Act, we have given non-university science institutions significantly more autonomy and flexibility in their economic management.
- Superfluous regulations have been reduced, performance incentives have been strengthened and a more efficient use of resources has been made possible.
- Now, with the help of the Joint Science Conference, solutions must be found that will allow this initiative to be implemented at universities as well.
- 
- We are giving non-university research institutions and the German Research Foundation (DFG) financial planning security and room for maneuver through the Pact for Research and Innovation with an annual funding increase of five percent until 2015.
- In the future, too, we want to ensure that research and development in Germany is funded in line with demand.
- 
- We are open to scientific progress and advocate a responsible approach to research and science instead of restricting it, for example, through civil clauses, i.e. the voluntary commitment of scientific institutions to conduct research exclusively for civilian purposes, or massive cuts in financial resources in individual research areas.
- 
- We will continue the Excellence Initiative jointly led by the federal and state governments.
- It will give top university research in Germany national and international visibility, create competition and strengthen the promotion of young scientists.
- 
Building for the future - Modern infrastructure and affordable mobility
More people in Germany should have the opportunity to freely decide how they want to realize their mobility wishes.
To achieve this, it is necessary to pave the way in the truest sense of the word so as not to miss out on the connection to the world.
We need the necessary infrastructure for this in Germany, but also in Europe:
modern research facilities and production plants,
fast, nationwide Internet access,
modern transportation routes,
a comprehensive, affordable mobility offer
and affordable housing.
That's why we coordinated the planning of the expansion of our energy networks across Germany for the first time,
accelerated the expansion
and at the same time strengthened public participation.
We have promoted mobility.
With the liberalization of long-distance bus services, we have brought a whole new range of mobility services to Germany,
offering people with low incomes in particular new opportunities to travel and participate in social life.
And we are continuing to work on nationwide, fast data networks and modern transport infrastructure throughout Germany.
We have abolished the "noise privileges" of the railroads (rail bonus).
In the future, no distinction will be made between road and rail noise when it comes to protecting residents.
Modern infrastructure and affordable mobility are essential for a progressive republic of free citizens.
Only with them can we master the challenges of globalization and together seize the opportunities of our time.
At the same time, we want to strengthen the cohesion of our society and make our contribution to ensuring that our cities and communities remain livable.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Mobility is a part of individual quality of life and personal freedom.
- The prerequisite for this is an efficient transportation infrastructure.
- We are committed to continuously reducing the adverse effects of mobility, such as emissions of pollutants and noise, without neglecting safety.
- Priority is given to combating emissions at source by intensifying research and continuous technical development.
- Active noise management must contribute to making the emissions that are unavoidable according to the state of the art as bearable as possible through organizational measures and information based on verifiable facts.
- A needs-based transport infrastructure is also a decisive location factor for our economy.
- We are therefore committed to the need to maintain our transport routes and continue to expand them in line with demand.
- However, this does not mean that the state has to carry out construction and operation itself.
- In many cases, cooperation with private service providers is an option.
- 
- Roads are and will remain the most important mode of transport in the medium term, both for passenger and freight traffic.
- This must also be reflected in the distribution of investment funds.
- The progressive deterioration of roads and bridges is creating an increasing need for funds.
- At the same time, the rail network in many regions is reaching its capacity limits.
- That is why we also want to increase investment in the rail network.
- To achieve this, it must be ensured, among other things, that revenues generated in the network remain in the network.
- As an immediate measure, Deutsche Bahn's network company must become more independent within the Group.
- To this end, we want to dissolve the control and profit transfer agreement with the holding company.
- 
- As a transit country, we are committed to efficient integration into the trans-European transport networks, cross-border networking of metropolitan regions and better linking of the various modes of transport.
- To this end, we want to improve links between airports and the high-speed rail network, for example.
- We want to ensure the competitiveness of Germany's seaports and inland ports, our gateways to the world, by swiftly expanding hinterland connections and also by making necessary adjustments to the fairways of the Lower Elbe, Lower Weser, Ems and Warnow, for example.
- We want to eliminate capacity bottlenecks on federal waterways and ensure adequate funding.
- 
- The full capacity of the lock facilities on the Kiel Canal is to be restored as quickly as possible.
- In addition, the rehabilitation and expansion of the Kiel Canal is to be laid down in a contract between the federal government and the state of Schleswig-Holstein.
- This contract is to ensure the financing and realization of an "Integrated Restoration and Expansion Concept" in order to fulfill this task according to a binding schedule with a necessarily increased personnel capacity for this purpose.
- 
- We will ensure that German transport locations and companies are not disadvantaged in international competition.
- We reject unilateral burdens and go-it-alone measures that only affect German companies.
- 
- The coast is a joint task:
- We stand by the future-oriented maritime industry, the Maritime Alliance and National Maritime Conferences.
- The course toward de-bureaucratization in the area of shipping is the right one - our goal is first of all a national coast guard and a uniform flag state administration.
- 
o The German transport industry needs reliable and fair framework and competitive conditions.
o That is why we did not increase the truck toll during the last legislative period and will only agree to a moderate adjustment in the future on the basis of a new road cost assessment. o
We want to reduce distortions of competition at European level.
o The nationwide field trial for long trucks should be continued and, if the positive results to date are confirmed, long trucks should be approved for point-to-point traffic on highways.
o 
- In addition to competition between rail and long-distance buses, we also need more competition in long-distance rail transport itself.
- We want to eliminate disadvantages for rail competitors and give the network more independence by separating network and operations.
- The partial privatization of the transport and logistics divisions remains an important goal.
- The network and infrastructure divisions will not be privatized.
- 
- We Liberals reject a general speed limit on Germany's highways.
- Speed limits should serve to protect residents from noise or to improve traffic safety and should therefore always be set in relation to the situation.
- Speed controls serve traffic safety and not to fill state budgets.
- We will therefore work to legalize radar detectors for stationary installations, as this will encourage drivers to drive carefully at danger points.
- 
- In order to create a reliable framework for local public transport, we have already amended the Passenger Transportation Act and adapted it to the European legal framework.
- We are committed to public co-financing of local public transport in Germany in line with demand.
- Our guiding principle is an entrepreneurial and competitive public transport system. -
We want to secure opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate
- and in particular to ensure a diversity of operators in the bus sector.
- 
- Air traffic is of great importance for Germany as a business location.
- We therefore stand by the need for coordinated, demand-driven further development of the airport infrastructure.
- We will also press ahead with increasing the efficiency of air traffic control in Europe while further improving the high level of safety.
- At the same time, we will further develop active and passive noise abatement measures to limit noise pollution from air traffic, particularly in the vicinity of airports, in order to achieve a fair balance of interests between the aviation industry and local residents.
- We want to achieve competitive neutrality in the further development of emissions trading for aviation and work with our partners in and outside Europe to campaign for its expansion.
- To improve Germany's competitiveness as a business location, we call for the abolition of the air traffic tax.
- 
- Constantly increasing road safety is an important concern for us.
- New drive technologies such as silent electric cars and fast electric bicycles, but also demographic change, present us with new challenges in this area.
- We are committed to finding pragmatic solutions with a high level of acceptance.
- We will place particular emphasis on the groups of young novice drivers and senior citizens.
- We also want to further promote traffic education for the youngest road users.
- 
- We advocate the nationwide introduction of accompanied driving from the age of 16 (BF 16).
- 
o Less traffic noise means a better quality of life.
o At the same time, better noise protection increases acceptance for the expansion of our traffic routes.
o We want to further improve noise protection.
o We want to achieve a fair balance of interests between the transport industry and those living near roads, railroads and airports.
o We want to maintain mobility and combat noise at source.
o We want to provide greater support for the testing and use of innovative noise protection measures (e.g. new variants of "whisper asphalt") in road construction.
o In the rail transport sector, we want to review whether the current structure of noise-dependent track access charges meets the objective of providing an incentive to retrofit low-noise braking systems.
o We will continue the noise abatement program for old railroad lines at a high level.
o Residents living near military airports have the same right to noise protection as residents living near civilian airports, because noise protection is health protection.
o 
- The demands on citizens' mobility continue to increase, for example to reach the workplace or to ensure quality of life in sparsely populated regions.
- Mobility must not become a social issue.
- In the long term, affordable and climate-friendly mobility requires a move away from fossil fuels.
- In addition to increasing the efficiency of conventional engines, we want to open up the option for all technological paths: Electric cars with battery technology, hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles and alternative fuels in aviation, for example, among others.
- They each have their strengths in different segments of the vehicle market.
- 
- We want to further improve the framework conditions for electromobility.
- As a subsidy-free purchase incentive, we advocate simplifying traffic laws and introducing interchangeable license plates for electric cars as second cars for inner-city traffic.
- 
- In the case of biofuels, we take care to ensure that there is no competition between the tank and the plate.
- To this end, the energy policy targets for the use of biofuels must be reviewed.
- We therefore want to promote the development of second-generation biofuels made exclusively from food crop residues and wood as well as organic waste by funding research, in order to minimize competition for land in the long term.
- At the same time, when implementing the EU directive on biofuels, we want to place greater emphasis once again on incentives to use pure biofuels instead of rigid blending quotas, as with E10.
- 
- In addition to liquid biofuels, the use of biogas or liquefied natural gas is an option.
- By making appropriate clarifications in the EEG on the separate accounting of feedstocks, we want to make it possible for biogas from residual materials to flow increasingly into the fuel sector instead of into electricity generation.
- 
- In order not to overload the traffic routes in growing cities despite increased traffic volumes, the infrastructure must not only be systematically expanded and converted as part of integrated traffic management,
but new forms of education and work that take advantage of modern communications technology must also be increasingly promoted.
- Opportunities for home offices, telecommuting, distance learning or online lectures reduce commuter traffic and reduce the need for housing in the city center near places of work and education.
- 
Shaping an attractive living environment - urban and rural living
Having adequate housing is a basic existential need of every human being.
The task of the state in the social market economy is to create the framework conditions for this.
The challenges of demographic change, climate protection, integration and inclusion also make innovative housing and urban development concepts a cross-cutting task.
It occupies a key position for the economic and social development of our country.
Against the backdrop of demographic change, the aim is to create demand-oriented living space through both the conversion of existing buildings and the construction of new ones.
The aim is to remove barriers not only in buildings but also in public spaces.
Energy, land and raw materials must be used sparingly without overburdening tenants and owners economically.
In this context, it is also important to respond to the different requirements in metropolitan areas, metropolitan regions and rural areas with effective solutions.
We want people in Germany to live well.
We have therefore supported the purchase of residential property, e.g. through the home ownership pension ("Wohn-Riester").
To support the energy-efficient refurbishment of affordable housing and thus also contribute to low ancillary housing costs, we have expanded the building refurbishment program and reformed tenancy law.
We have prevented exorbitant rent increases as well as so-called rent nomadism.
For livable cities and communities, we have also further developed the federal government's urban redevelopment programs and expanded the financial scope.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Home ownership is an important contribution to retirement provision and the best protection against rising rents.
- That is why the FDP is also focusing on ownership here.
- Home ownership promotion models such as cooperative housing, home ownership pensions ("Wohn-Riester"), equity replacement loans, builder-owner associations and financing support need to be developed further.
- The promotion of home ownership frees up private capital for housing construction and is an important element in reducing the housing shortage in urban areas.
- 
- To create more affordable housing and limit land consumption, we want to facilitate construction measures and redensification in inner-city areas.
- For this reason, we want to further facilitate, for example, the reuse of brownfield sites and the simplified designation of development plans for inner-city development.
- 
- We firmly reject further regulatory intervention in the housing market, such as rent caps and refurbishment bans.
- They make the housing market even more inflexible, make it more difficult to balance supply and demand via the market price, reduce the funds needed for new construction and refurbishment, and thus further contribute to the housing shortage in densely populated areas.
- 
- We want to redirect federal housing subsidies in a budget-neutral way and provide greater support for the construction of new affordable rental housing.
- Federal allocations to the states for social housing must be earmarked to prevent individual states from continuing to use the money for other purposes.
- In this context, we liberals prefer the much more flexible subject subsidy, which, in contrast to object subsidies, is individually oriented to the current family and income situation of the tenant and is not rigidly tied to a property.
- This also avoids incorrect occupancy.
- We also want to reintroduce declining balance depreciation (AfA) to improve the general conditions for rental housing construction.
- Building law and the corresponding ordinances must be reviewed to ensure their effectiveness.
- We want to reduce bureaucracy in order to facilitate conversions and densification in metropolitan areas on the one hand, and on the other hand to enable adjustments and deconstruction in rural areas as flexible local solutions.
- To this end, urban development funding must be evaluated accordingly and adjusted to requirements in the event of any undesirable developments.
- 
- For the supply of housing to meet demand, the construction of new apartments must be attractive, especially in growing cities.
- For this to happen, renting out apartments must also be profitable. -
Stronger state intervention in the pricing of new rentals and refurbishment bans jeopardize housing construction and are therefore resolutely rejected by us, as are interventions in the contractual freedom of brokerage transactions.
o The energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings plays a key role in the implementation of the energy turnaround.
o We therefore want to significantly increase the rate of renovation in existing buildings by means of incentives in order to increase energy efficiency. o
This requires long-term planning and investment security for investors.
o We will therefore continue to finance the KfW building renovation program at least at the current level.
o We continue to advocate tax incentives for energy-efficient building renovation as a second funding channel.
o 
- For us, the principle of "incentives instead of compulsion" applies to building refurbishment.
- We reject compulsory renovation of existing buildings.
- In doing so, we also keep an eye on the principle of economic efficiency and will not support demands for excessive environmental and energy requirements (EnEV) in existing buildings.
- Regulatory law can only come into play in new construction.
- Here, however, we want to keep the Energy Saving Ordinance at a technically ambitious level at all times.
- The basis should always be the overall energy efficiency of buildings, ventilation and heating systems, not the arbitrary prohibition of certain technologies.
- 
- The demand for age-appropriate housing is increasing.
- Barriers must therefore be removed.
- Not all elderly or disabled people need accessibility.
- Often, less expensive barrier-free housing is sufficient to enable independent and self-determined living into old age.
- This must be taken into account in the funding programs in order to enable as many people as possible to live in their own homes in old age.
- 
- We want strong cities and communities that are attractive and livable for people of all ages and in every situation.
- That is why we will continue the federal government's urban development programs and support corresponding efforts by the municipalities.
- In order to support the requirements of demographic change, especially in rural areas, we promote the strengthening of municipal centers where social and technical infrastructure can be provided cost-effectively and centrally accessible.
- 
- The expansion of telecommunications networks is basically a matter for private companies.
- However, the universal service for telecommunications services must in future include a broadband Internet connection.
- The content of the universal service must always be dynamically adapted to growing transmission capacities.
- 
- All new construction and conversion measures must already take into account the fact that the housing and real estate market must be able to react flexibly to further structural changes.
- In particular, adjustments in the inner cities must be made in such a way that later conversions and reallocations are possible at any time.
- 
- The historical cultural heritage and the protection of monuments should be expressly supported as identity-forming and the building culture should be cultivated.
- For this reason, we are committed to involving citizens at an early stage in the planning and construction process of relevant building projects that have an impact on the local image.
- 
- We want to implement necessary infrastructure projects more transparently, cost-efficiently and quickly.
- Taxpayers' money must be used efficiently and effectively.
- In the interests of the people and of Germany as a business location, we want to prevent unnecessary delays in the planning and construction process and excessive construction times as well as significant cost increases in local and national public construction projects.
- 
Making the future possible - environmental, nature and climate protection for a world worth living in
Liberal environmental and climate policy focuses on innovation and new technologies.
It relies on responsible citizens, not prohibitions.
This is the only way to ensure an intact living space for our children and future generations.
And what's more: as an exporter of ideas and innovations, we help to save energy and resources, avoid emissions
and improve people's quality of life - today and in the future, in Germany and around the world.
That is why we are converting our power supply more quickly to renewable energies.
With the Energy and Climate Fund, we have channeled all proceeds from emissions trading into additional environmental protection projects.
We have significantly increased our funding for cooperation with developing countries in climate and forest protection.
We have made emissions trading less bureaucratic.
We are working to implement the target we adopted in the German government to reduce CO2 emissions nationally by 40 percent by 2020 and by 80 to 95 percent by 2050 compared with 1990 levels.
This is subject to ongoing scientific review with a view to effectiveness and national implementation.
We have made more recycling possible through the reform of the Recycling Management Act.
We have improved air pollution control at power plants and small combustion plants.
We supported private motorists and craftsmen in retrofitting their vehicles with particulate filters.
With the federal "Biological Diversity" and "Reconnection" programs, we have made sustainable progress in nature conservation in Germany.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- On the basis of the latest research findings, we Liberals are committed to a radical global reduction in the emission of gases that are harmful to the climate,
- as part of a new climate protection agreement that is binding for all countries.
- In our view, there must be a short-term reduction in CO2 emissions in all industrialized countries and a long-term equalization of these emissions per capita.
- Obligations should be based on emissions and economic strength, not on a traditional status as an industrialized or developing country.
- In the meantime, we are committed to the swift ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
- 
- We place great emphasis on emissions trading in climate protection.
- It ensures effective emissions limitation at the lowest economic cost.
- We firmly reject the idea of replacing EU emissions trading with a CO2 tax.
- We Liberals want to extend EU emissions trading to the entire transport and heating sector.
- The starting point should be the highest trading level of fuels.
- Taxes that lose their environmental incentive effect can be reduced or abolished in return.
- We call for more intensive negotiations to link EU emissions trading with existing and planned trading systems, for example in North America, Korea and Australia.
- 
- In the next legislative period, we Liberals will continue to ensure that Germany's pledges to finance climate protection projects in developing countries - both for greenhouse gas reduction and for adaptation to climate change - are honored and that the use of the funds awarded is monitored.
- 
- Nuclear power plants in Germany will continue to operate for just under another decade.
- The safety of the remaining reactors must continue to be ensured at the highest level.
- Decommissioned nuclear power plants must be dismantled as quickly as possible in order to utilize the expertise of the existing workforce.
- Nuclear research and corresponding university education must be maintained in Germany.
- Expertise and skilled personnel must be available in the long term for the dismantling of German nuclear power plants.
- In addition, Germany should contribute to the safe operation of nuclear power plants worldwide, especially in our neighboring countries.
- 
o We stand for an open-ended search for a repository for high-level radioactive waste. o
Suitable sites are to be examined in a step-by-step process. o
No site must be excluded from the outset.
o Intensive citizen participation and a final siting decision by means of a federal law should ensure social acceptance for this national task.
o 
- In order to strengthen resource protection, we want to promote recycling by introducing the recycling garbage can across the board.
- In contrast to the yellow garbage can, not only packaging but all suitable recyclable materials are to be collected here.
- The changeover must take place in such a way that neither municipal nor private providers are given preferential treatment and parallel systems are avoided.
- In the interests of consumers, we Liberals stand for a competitive waste management industry.
- We support recycling.
- That is why we are committed to setting ambitious recycling quotas for commercial and construction waste, which is important in terms of volume.
- 
- We will align political targets for land use more closely with nature conservation goals.
- We Liberals will evaluate the pilot project on tradable land certificates for further legislation.
- 
- Overall, nature conservation law needs to be streamlined without sacrificing the protection of nature.
- The federal states should be given the opportunity to put the so-called compensation money on an equal footing with other instruments of compensation.
- This involves paying money earmarked to compensate for an intervention, which is then invested in significant nature conservation measures in the same natural area.
- This is often more effective than a patchwork of individual measures.
- 
- The Alps are a unique habitat in Bavaria and the whole of Germany, which is particularly close to our Liberals' hearts.
- We want to preserve the protected zones designated in the Alpine Plan.
- Protected forests are to be protected from clearing - the stock-conserving management is to be supported with suitable means.
- As a matter of principle, the modernization of existing tourist facilities takes precedence over new construction.
- The Alpine Convention must be implemented consistently.
- 
- Free-flowing rivers and river sections have a high ecological value.
- More space must be given to waterways, and not just for flood protection.
- On federal waterways, cooperation between the federal and state governments should finally be improved to enhance navigability, flood protection and, in particular, nature conservation concerns.
- In the case of hydroelectric power plants, too, the concerns of flood protection must be taken into account, as must nature and animal protection.
- We continue to reject the construction of barrages in the Elbe and Danube.
- 
- For us liberals, animal welfare has been of central importance for years.
- Free Democrats are guided by the five freedoms: Freedom from hunger and thirst; Freedom from discomfort; Freedom from pain, injury, disease; Freedom to act out species-appropriate behaviors; Freedom from fear and suffering. -
Our further efforts focus on the principles of sustainable management,
- the avoidance of economic disincentives,
- animal husbandry and nutrition appropriate to the species and their effective control.
- We also support the reduction of animal testing through the increased use of alternative methods.
- Since successful animal welfare can only be realized at European level, we call for a more committed EU policy in this area.
- 
o The protection of biodiversity is a cross-sectional task that must be taken into account in all policy areas.
o We will continue to expand the Federal Program on Biological Diversity, which was launched during our term in office.
o When cultivating energy crops, care must be taken to ensure that monocultures that are harmful to nature and the environment do not predominantly develop on agricultural land.
o We shape nature conservation with people.
o Nature users such as sailors, hikers, climbers and mountain bikers must not be regarded as opponents in nature conservation issues, but rather as partners in dialogue at eye level.
o For this reason, we are increasingly relying on voluntary measures and contractual nature conservation, and only secondarily on sovereign protected area ordinances and bans.
o Dissected biotope networks should be reunited, as we have begun to do in the federal government with the federal reconnection program.
o 
- The protection of biodiversity worldwide aims to preserve the genetic reproduction potential for future generations.
- To protect tropical forests, we support models for rewarding avoided permitted logging, measures against illegal logging, targeted poverty reduction in the affected regions, and certification of timber.
- A global system of marine protected areas must be created to protect marine flora and fauna.
- African states in particular should be enabled to more effectively prevent illegal fishing in their economic zones.
- 
- We need sustainable fisheries that conserve stocks, are species-appropriate and ensure animal welfare.
- Bottom trawling must be restricted.
- In any case, industrial fishing must be curbed by designating priority and exclusion areas.
- Since the basic foodstuff fish is endangered by overfishing of the oceans, the framework conditions for sustainable aquaculture should also be further improved.
- 
- We want to continue our efforts at European level to ensure sustainability certification for all agricultural raw materials, as already exists today for biofuels.
- In the certification process, the declarations of commitment for European farmers (cross-compliance rules) must be recognized in an unbureaucratic manner.
- 
Taking responsibility for one's own decisions - acting sustainably
Where opportunities open up for people, where possibilities open up, that is where sustainable development is possible.
If you deprive people of opportunities for their own life paths, you make sustainable development impossible.
Because sustainability has nothing to do with asceticism or a conservation of the world.
In all our actions, however, we must be able to take responsibility for the consequences for the environment, our fellow human beings and our posterity.
That is why we have strengthened innovation, research and development.
We have made more education possible
and reduced new debt by more than 50 percent compared to the plans of the previous black-red government.
That's 150 billion euros less debt.
After years of shortage management, we have stabilized our social systems and begun to shift them to sustainable financing.
The first elements of funded long-term care insurance have been introduced,
a competitive premium model has been introduced for health insurance,
and private pension provision has been further strengthened.
The energy turnaround has been accelerated and freed from the ideological corset of the red-green coalition so that it can succeed in reality.
And instead of alimenting, we have created new possibilities and opportunities:
1.6 million new jobs subject to social security contributions mean 1.6 million new prospects for people in Germany and their families.
Sustainable development is not just about the environment and climate policy.
Sustainable development also requires sustainable management,
intergenerational budgeting
and technical, social, economic and scientific innovation.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
o Sustainable development is only possible in and through freedom.
o For liberals, sustainability has nothing to do with asceticism.
o People today also have a right to a good life.
o We cannot and should not conserve the world.
o But we have to answer for our actions to the environment and posterity.
o Because we liberals also measure freedom by the freedom of future generations.
o If we live today at the expense of future generations, we leave them with the worst possible starting opportunities.
o Future generations should have at least the same opportunities for freedom as people today.
o 
- In the interest of future generations, politics needs a perspective of decades, not election periods.
- We therefore advocate interdepartmental and indicator-based sustainability strategies at national and European level.
- We will continue the tried and tested committees for monitoring the sustainability strategy in government and parliament.
- 
- We want to see the introduction of an official generational balance sheet.
- This will compare benefits for future generations - such as spending on education, infrastructure and social security - with their burdens in terms of public debt, pension burdens and obligations under intergenerational agreements.
- The regulatory impact assessment must be supplemented by a generational balance sheet for key projects.
- 
- Sustainability also requires that we reduce new government debt, use additional tax revenue to reduce debt and place our country's social systems on a solid foundation that will last for generations.
- Sustainability also includes maintaining and modernizing roads, buildings and other facilities in the area of public infrastructure.
- At present, public-sector investment in Germany is not even sufficient to compensate for the age-related wear and tear in this area.
- We therefore call for continuous and targeted investment by the public sector in roads, traffic routes, schools and other public buildings as well as public utility networks.
- 
- The development of the Sustainable Development Goals at UN level must be in line with the follow-up process to the Millennium Development Goals.
- Parliaments must be involved in the development of the goals.
- To this end, we want to promote international parliamentary dialogs on the part of the German government.
- 
- In the future, gross domestic product (GDP) is to be retained as a clear measurable variable for growth.
- In addition, however, the indicators of prosperity and quality of life proposed by the Enquete Commission "Growth, Prosperity, Quality of Life" of the German Bundestag are to be reported regularly.
- 
- Education plays a special role in developing and promoting self-responsible action.
- Education for sustainable development must become the guiding principles of teaching, learning and action at all ages, like education for peace, democracy, personal responsibility and tolerance.
- 
- 
- While rejecting prohibitions and commandments, we nevertheless recommend all businesses and companies to take great care to improve their own raw material and environmental balance sheets in their own economic interests.
- Publicly traded companies should follow the German Sustainability Code in their reporting when preparing their annual financial statements.
- 
VI. responsibility so that Europe remains a stable and reliable community
The greatest gain in freedom in the history of our country after the Second World War was and is the European unification process.
The growing together of an entire continent and its peoples has given millions of people the peace and freedom to fulfill their dreams and go their own way.
The Nobel Prize for the European Union honored this historic achievement as well as the courage of the peoples of Europe.
We want this Europe to have a strong future.
We assume responsibility for peace, freedom, prosperity and security in a common Europe.
So that Europe remains a continent of opportunities and togetherness.
We can only master the great challenges of our time by further developing Europe into a global shaping force.
To this end, we want to strengthen Europe's strengths: Europe's diversity,
the market economy order,
the rule of law,
decentralized decision-making.
Centralism must not be allowed to shape Europe.
Only in this way can we preserve our community of values, assert our interests as an economic power and make a European contribution to the future order of the world.
To this end, we want to overcome the debt crisis of individual member states and put our common currency and the Union on a firm footing.
Stabilizing the single currency is in Germany's best interest.
There is a great opportunity for the euro and the European Union as a whole to emerge stronger from the crisis.
We think about the future of Europe.
We want to realize political union with decentralized structures.
With our commitment to the Fiscal Treaty and the Future Group of Foreign Ministers on deepening the European Union, we have taken major steps in this direction.
For us liberals, Europe is part of our cultural identity, a reassurance of our freedom, and at the same time a necessity in order to be able to survive in global competition in the future.
This unique zone of freedom,
of prosperity
and diverse cultural enrichment is a liberal promise and obligation.
And this Europe remains a magnet for people and peoples.
Europe - liberal promise and obligation
Improving competitiveness,
driving fiscal consolidation
and stabilizing our currency were necessary to
overcome the crisis and open up prospects for growth.
However, we must not forget this: Europe is more than the euro.
Europe is founded on common values and beliefs.
And preserving and strengthening this common ground is just as much our task and responsibility today as ensuring the stability of our currency.
The final report of the Future Group of eleven foreign ministers initiated by Germany reflects that many of our ideas are falling on fertile ground.
We know that Europe is an association of states with unique social, political, constitutional and economic commonalities.
That is why we want to continue responsibly along the path of deepening -
toward a political union with firm federal principles,
democratic structures
and a clear subsidiarity-based order.
That is what we stand for.
This is what we stand for.
- We want to turn the wheel of history in Europe forwards and not backwards.
- We want to take all 28 countries with us on the path to integration.
- The Convention method is the right way to do this, as provided for by the EU Treaty.
- Only if the convention method is not feasible because a few people do not want it must another path be chosen.
- The Fiscal Compact has shown how this can be done.
- At the end of this development there should be a European federal state legitimized by a Europe-wide referendum.
- 
- Greater coordination of economic policy to increase Europe's competitiveness is an important intermediate stage on the road to political union. -
We want to complete the European single market,
- align the common agricultural policy more closely with the principles of the social market economy and sustainability
- and strengthen Europe's leading role in the key areas of research, technology and services.
- 
- We want a Europe of the citizens.
- The cornerstone of political union is democratic legitimacy and control.
- We therefore advocate developing the European Parliament into a full parliament with an equal right of initiative in legislation.
- The Parliament should be allowed to decide for itself where it sits. -
We want to Europeanize the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament
- and advocate that in the future, European parties should run on cross-state lists.
- 
- We want to strengthen the Commission's position as guardian of the treaties.
- To achieve this, the Commission must become more efficient, but not larger.
- On the contrary, we advocate reducing the size of the European Commission.
- 
- In addition to the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union should play an essential role as an equal chamber of the LÃ¤nder in order to guarantee democratic control and political balance ("checks and balances") in the European multi-level system.
- 
- The Europe of the citizens is characterized by firm and clear competences and the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality.
- Bureaucracy and centralism have no place in it.
- Instead, we want strong regions that are close to the citizens.
- We want to provide better institutional safeguards for the legal principle of subsidiarity, make greater use of existing instruments and expand them, and set up a European subsidiarity court in which infringements of competences can also be challenged.
- 
- We see a great opportunity in the enlargement of the EU, provided and insofar as candidates are ready to join and the European Union is receptive.
- We also insist that the EU make institutional progress before agreeing to further admissions.
- 
- We will ensure that these admission requirements are strictly adhered to.
- Each new member must finally resolve all outstanding disputes with its neighbors before deciding on its admission.
- This applies in particular to the countries of the Western Balkans.
- We are pleased to welcome Croatia as the 28th member of the European Union this year.
- 
- We have been linked with Turkey for decades by a profound partnership and joint membership in NATO.
- Since 2005, the EU and Turkey have been conducting open-ended negotiations on Turkish EU membership.
- We remain committed to Turkey's accession prospects.
- However, as in all cases, there must be no discounts when it comes to meeting the accession criteria.
- We encourage Turkey to press ahead more resolutely with the necessary reform process toward the rule of law and human rights.
- 
- Determined rule-of-law reforms are also a prerequisite for the further rapprochement of the Eastern Partnership countries with the EU.
- Ukraine, for example, has a long-term chance of joining the EU if it consistently pursues a course of modernization in the coming years and steadily works its way up to EU standards.
- 
- The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights must be respected in all EU member states, regardless of the political color of the respective national government.
- We will therefore continue to resolutely oppose developments such as those in Hungary and Romania, which endanger the balance of political power through an excessive claim to power by the government.
- 
- We want to strengthen and protect our common values and, to this end, improve the procedure for monitoring the rule of law in Europe.
- So far, the EU can only act if serious and lasting violations of common European values have already occurred.
- We want to create an appropriate mechanism below this threshold of Article 7 of the EU Treaty that allows the European Commission to defend fundamental European values in the member states and, if necessary, to impose tangible and appropriate sanctions.
- 
- Freedom of travel is one of the most precious achievements of European integration.
- We should not put it at risk lightly.
- We Liberals are therefore vehemently opposed to giving national governments a blank check to reintroduce border controls.
- 
- To ensure that freedom of travel can be and remains experienced even in difficult economic times, we call for a consistent continuation and expansion of European exchange programs such as ERASMUS.
- Young Europeans develop friendships across borders, form networks, and thus make an indispensable contribution to strengthening European identity and combating prejudice.
- 
- We want to further improve the framework conditions for conventional and organic agriculture through market-based reforms and a consistent reduction in bureaucracy.
- This includes planning security for farmers through market-based further development of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the reduction of distortions of competition within the EU.
- We will continue to work to ensure that EU law is consistently transposed 1:1 into national law.
- 
o We want to reduce regulation and bureaucracy in the interest of farmers' entrepreneurial freedom
o and gradually reduce direct payments from 2020.
o However, we reject capping above a certain number of hectares and degressive direct payments, also depending on jobs. o In
the long term, this leads to inefficient farm structures. o
These instruments do not lead to any improvements in consumer, environmental and animal protection.
o They lead to higher costs due to evasive reactions, e.g. farm divisions, and weaken the competitiveness of agriculture.
- A strong Europe also includes the Council of Europe and its institutions.
- With its 47 member states, the Council of Europe plays a fundamental role in the implementation of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, which we Liberals want to strengthen further.
- 
- We are committed to ensuring that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected in all EU member states and want the European Convention on Human Rights to be implemented swiftly in the EU.
- We are committed to the European Court of Human Rights and actively support its reform.
- 
From a common currency area to a stability union
Stabilizing our currency and fighting the debt crisis will remain one of the most important challenges for us Liberals in the coming years.
We know: Stabilizing our currency does not come for free.
But for us, Europe doesn't just have a price.
But above all, Europe has a value for us Germans.
Because we can only ensure lasting peace, freedom and prosperity for Germany through and with a strong Europe.
But we also know that all this is only possible with a stable currency.
After the Social Democrats and the Greens tore up the Stability Pact in 2003, thus triggering today's crisis, we have now initiated a turnaround and created a new stability culture.
To emerge from the crisis, we must continue to strengthen Europe - and not weaken Germany.
For this reason, the volume of liability for the federal budget remains strictly limited under constitutional law
and the budget law of the German Bundestag remain untouched.
Parliament always has the final say.
And that is why we have prevented the communitization of debt through Eurobonds or a debt redemption fund.
We do not want a debt Europe, but a genuine stability union.
We have already achieved a great deal on the road to the Stability Union.
In the Fiscal Treaty, 25 member states agreed to introduce national debt brakes and get their budgets in order.
And with the European Stability Mechanisms EFSF and ESM, we have not only put up rescue parachutes for our currency,
but also created the basis for strengthening competitiveness in the crisis countries.
In accordance with the principle of "no performance without compensation," aid to crisis countries is always accompanied by a commitment to sustainable and ambitious reforms.
We want to continue on the path to the Stability Union.
Because we are convinced that stable budgets, greater competitiveness and stronger growth are prerequisites for a stable currency.
Because only in this way can Europe grow out of its debts in the long term and hold its own in global competition.
The impression must not be created of a German-dominated and dirigistely launched austerity policy in the EU, which leads to resentment and the evocation of old enemy images.
To overcome the financial and sovereign debt crisis, Germany must live up to its responsibility and come up with solutions.
Germany should constructively assist other EU member states in implementing structural reforms
and, at the same time, promote the wise use of EU budget funds to enable economic recovery for all as quickly as possible.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Solidarity also requires solidity.
- Structural reforms are needed.
- Countries that cannot manage without temporary support must comply with the commitments negotiated with the partners.
- The pressure to reform must be maintained.
- There must be no false incentives.
- We vehemently reject a relapse into the Keynesian debt policy of the 1970s.
- For liberals, monetary stability is a basic prerequisite for sustainable growth in a social market economy.
- Solidarity also means subsidiarity.
- German taxpayers must not be obliged to finance services that go beyond the standards in their own country.
- 
- Europe's crisis began with the breach of the EU Stability and Growth Pact in 2003
- we are drawing the right conclusions from this experience and consistently implementing the fiscal pact we called for.
- Only if Europe succeeds in turning away from debt policy and we continue on the path to the Stability Union will we create a reliable framework that generates long-term confidence in the competitiveness, stability and reliability of the euro zone and Europe as a whole.
- Stable budgets and sound fiscal policy also include effectively combating tax evasion.
- Together with our European partners, we must prevent an outflow of assets from some member states through information sharing.
- 
- An independent central bank is one of the most important prerequisites for a stable currency.
- That is why we are defending the ECB's independence against any encroachment.
- The ECB remains committed to monetary stability, as enshrined in the European treaties.
- We firmly reject state financing by the ECB and thus the restructuring of state budgets through inflation.
- 
- We have managed to move from crisis mode to crisis resolution mode.
- We are building a stability union.
- For this, sensible regulation of the banking sector and bank control are essential so that the real economy can function and flourish within the euro zone according to the principles of the social market economy within a clear regulatory framework.
- 
- We stand for a stability union with sound budgets and finances.
- We will not support a liability union.
- In addition to the unlimited liability of the federal budget, this would also remove any pressure to reform from weakly competitive states.
- 
- In order to effectively and sustainably combat the high youth unemployment in some member states, we are promoting the dual training system.
- At around seven percent, Germany has one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the European Union.
- The combination of vocational practice and school-based training is an export hit for the European region and beyond.
- We consider state-funded employment programs, such as the "youth guarantee" proposed by the European Commission, to be misguided in terms of regulatory policy, as they cannot be financed in the long term, achieve only straw-fire effects and their expenditure further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
- 
- We want the EU member states to retain their own budgetary sovereignty and the responsibility to budget carefully in the future.
- That is why we reject European taxes.
- 
o For political, legal and economic reasons, we Liberals reject joint and several liability for government bonds of the member states, as in the case of Eurobonds or an old debt redemption fund, both today and in the future.
o Europe only has a future as a community of responsibility in which everyone is liable for their actions.
o That is why we are committed to a European insolvency regime for sovereigns to complement the existing stabilization instruments.
o The goal must be to replace the endless "rescue routine" with binding rules that provide certainty for all parties involved as to when the process will begin and that it can be completed swiftly, as well as to achieve a fair balance of interests with creditors and restore capital market viability.
o 
- The ESM is not a permanent solution.
- As soon as a functioning stability union with effective sanctions for excessive sovereign debt is in place, the ESM must be phased out.
- 
VII. peace, so that more people get more opportunities
In Germany today, more people have the freedom to fulfill their dreams and go their own way.
This makes us strong and creates prosperity.
But Germany must not be satisfied with itself.
Reliable alliances,
the UN peace order
and a strong Europe have contributed significantly to the fact that a life in peace and prosperity in Germany seems almost self-evident to us.
This is also a historic success for German foreign, human rights and development policy.
A success that is also a mission for us:
We want to make the freedom and opportunities we enjoy in Germany and Europe today accessible to as many people around the world as possible.
More people worldwide should live in peace in their countries,
Security
and prosperity.
We want to achieve this goal through cooperation within proven organizations and alliances.
We want to maintain and expand proven partnerships, but also establish new ones.
If you want to shape globalization, you need strong partners.
In doing so, we rely on dialogue, partnership and the primacy of political approaches to solutions.
We stand by the culture of military restraint.
Liberal foreign, human rights and development policy is peace policy.
It relies on shared and common responsibility.
That is why we want international disarmament initiatives to continue to play an important role in German and international policy.
And that is why we invest our development cooperation in more opportunities for the people in our cooperation countries.
We are committed to upholding and strengthening human rights worldwide,
to protecting freedom,
democracy and the rule of law, as well
as to protecting progress, prosperity based on cultural self-determination,
and protecting our citizens from global security risks.
Global problems can only be tackled through global cooperation.
In doing so, we create more opportunities for more people around the world.
More options for one's life plan and more opportunities to improve one's living conditions.
In responsibility and partnership for more peace in the world
German foreign policy is value-driven and interest-oriented.
It is oriented toward historically grown and proven communities of values,
and it seeks and promotes new partnerships.
Without neglecting the transatlantic partnership or our other established friendships and alliances, liberal foreign policy has laid the groundwork for new partnerships.
As new powerhouses in their respective regions and beyond, emerging economies in Latin America, Asia and Africa are increasingly important partners for Germany and Europe - in trade, but also in tackling global challenges of the future such as climate change, disarmament and the protection of biodiversity.
With our partners around the world, we will continue to tackle problems such as climate change, poverty, terrorism, war, human rights abuses and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction with a sense of shared responsibility.
Liberal foreign policy supports the historic political transformation processes in North Africa and the Arab world with tailored transformation partnerships.
We liberals want to move these societies in the direction of liberal democracy
and market economy.
Through numerous projects, non-governmental organizations in particular help to enforce human rights, monitor their implementation, and anchor human rights and democratic participation in the consciousness of the population and in state structures.
Respect for human rights
and genuine civic participation are the foundation for a country's democratic, economic and cultural development.
We focus on expanding cooperation within proven organizations.
We focus on dialog and partnership.
Even where it is difficult.
Only dialogue creates trust and the possibility of peaceful conflict resolution.
Liberal foreign policy is peace policy.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We are committed to deeper integration in the European Union's security and defense policy (CSDP) by bringing the Treaty of Lisbon to life and entering into Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) with our European partners.
- We want to further strengthen traditional ties, especially transatlantic relations.
- Common positions within the framework of the CSDP are always also an orientation for the EU members represented in the Security Council.
- In the long term, the EU must have its own seat on the United Nations Security Council.
- At the same time, we want to further strengthen cooperation on security issues with France and Poland within the framework of the Weimar Triangle.
- The USA and Canada, but also value partners such as Japan and Australia, remain our natural allies in solving global issues within an international framework.
- 
- The transatlantic relationship is broad and diverse.
- As a strategic goal of transatlantic cooperation, we are driving forward the realization of a transatlantic free trade area in order to achieve shared prosperity gains and to make it clear worldwide that the two global centers of democratic market economies are cooperating closely.
- 
- We will expand our relations with the new shaping powers, which are emerging as important powerhouses in their regions through their economic dynamism, their striving for participation and prosperity, and their growing political weight.
- This applies in particular to countries that share our democratic values.
- If you want to shape the future, you have to be ready to talk.
- Encouraging these new powerhouses to assume responsibility and integrating them into international structures on a partnership basis is a core idea of liberal foreign policy.
- 
o In addition to our continued involvement in the United Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe and the EU, we will also make greater use of the opportunities offered by new formats such as the G20.
o These formats offer the opportunity to introduce new solutions into international cooperation.
o Your long-term success will depend on your commitment to achieving results.
o At the heart of the reform is a UN Security Council that adequately reflects the new balances in the world of the 21st century.
o We will therefore continue to work to strengthen and comprehensively reform the United Nations.
o The United Nations is at the heart of a world order based on cooperation.
o Efforts should be made to strengthen parliamentary involvement in UN processes.
o We also want to continue the successful strengthening of Germany's personnel presence in these institutions.
o 
- To flank the UN climate negotiations, the FDP has significantly strengthened foreign climate policy as a new focus of German foreign policy in its area of responsibility.
- This opens up the opportunity for alliances with new shaping powers, but also with states particularly affected by climate change.
- At the same time, we want to further advance the dialog on the economic opportunities of low-emission modernization and strengthen communication of the energy transition abroad.
- To this end, we will provide German foreign policy with the necessary resources.
- 
- More than almost any other industrialized country, Germany is dependent on free trade and access to the global raw materials markets.
- German foreign policy will continue to consistently advocate this.
- This also includes strategic partnerships with important raw materials countries within the framework of a national raw materials strategy and the further dovetailing of foreign, security, development and economic policy interests in the area of foreign trade policy.
- We attach great importance to respect for human rights in the raw materials countries.
- 
- As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Germany made important contributions in 2011 and 2012, including the protection of children in armed conflicts, the current crises in Syria and Yemen, the establishment of a state in South Sudan and the stabilization of Afghanistan.
- With this very successful work, we have shown that Germany is prepared to assume global responsibility.
- It was also on the basis of this record that the international community elected us to the United Nations Human Rights Council for 2013-2014 with an impressive result.
- We must live up to this vote of confidence by pursuing an active, value-oriented and responsible human rights policy.
- Germany will also act as a troop contributor
- and donor of humanitarian aid and development cooperation within the framework of the United Nations.
- 
- We will continue to support the democratic forces in the reform states of the Arab Spring by offering services in the areas of rule of law development, market access, education and employment.
- 
- Freedom -
human rights
- and democracy are the prerequisites for political and also economic participation by the people and thus for the success of the reform forces.
- We are committed to supporting regional efforts to find solutions.
- We want to strengthen regional cooperation to overcome common challenges - such as in the context of the ASEAN states - and work in partnership to find solutions.
- 
- We will continue Germany's commitment to the Middle East peace process unabated.
- The basis of our policy remains the commitment to Israel's right to exist and a negotiated two-state solution.
- 
- We strongly advocate a diplomatic solution to the conflict over Iran's nuclear program in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
- A nuclear weaponization of Iran would be a danger not only for Israel and the entire region, but for the entire world.
- 
o We can only ensure lasting peace, security and prosperity in Europe with Russia.
o Our cooperation with Russia today is broad and diverse.
o Never before have our economies and societies been so closely intertwined.
o It is precisely for this reason that we observe the restrictions on civil rights by the government or judiciary in Russia with concern.
o Our view of the strategic opportunities of cooperation with Russia is not at odds with an open and sometimes critical dialogue.
o 
- Germany and China want to jointly exploit the opportunities of globalization.
- The question of how China integrates itself into the global regulatory framework in the long term is becoming increasingly important.
- We want a China that accepts its role as a responsible shaping power.
- Our open dialogue with China can also withstand differences of opinion.
- Human rights are an important topic of our regular exchanges.
- 
- Germany thrives on its openness and networking.
- This should also be expressed in a modern liberal visa policy.
- We are committed to visa-free travel with Russia, Turkey and the EU's eastern and southern neighbors as soon as they meet the necessary requirements.
- Liberal visa policy in a world that is moving closer together must shape proximity and not manage separation.
- 
- We advocate a coordinated European sanctions policy against the Lukashenko regime in Belarus.
- and increased cooperation with civil society.
- Even in Europe's last dictatorship, people should have the chance to transform their country into a free and tolerant civil society.
- 
- As an integral part of our foreign policy, cultural relations and education policy makes an irreplaceable contribution to global understanding. -
In this regard, we rely on cooperation with proven intermediaries such as the Goethe-Institut, political foundations, educational institutions and communication forums, on dialogues on the rule of law, scientific cooperation within the framework of a networked approach
- and on expanding Germany's positive image abroad.
- The networking concept must be incorporated even more strongly into the work of the intermediaries. -
At the same time, we want to further strengthen the exchange of scientists and highly qualified experts
- and present ourselves worldwide as the open and tolerant civil society that we are.
- 
- Particularly in view of our demographic challenges, we are dependent on motivated highly qualified people from other countries.
- To this end, it is important to promote the German language, which must remain at the center of Germany's cultural relations and education policy.
- Germany's global cultural presence through intermediary organizations such as Goethe Institutes and schools abroad should be further promoted.
- German schools abroad are an integral part of German cultural and educational policy.
- They are ambassadors of German education policy and also play a major role in foreign trade, international relations and the transmission of values.
- They will therefore continue to receive our full support in the future.
- We will work to ensure that cultural relations and education policy continues to receive financial support.
- It is a key pillar of German foreign policy.
- 
Human rights are the foundation of a free society
Human rights are the foundation for a country's democratic, economic and cultural development.
Only where people can live in freedom can there be hope, progress and prosperity in the long term.
We regard human rights policy as a cross-cutting task that affects all policy areas and is at the core of liberal foreign and development policy.
The observance and strengthening of human rights in Germany, Europe and worldwide is a core concern of our policy.
We also align our development cooperation with this goal.
Since then, financial assistance for certain countries has been consistently linked to compliance with human rights policy conditions.
We have succeeded in having access to clean drinking water and sanitation recognized as a human right by the United Nations.
We have closed criminal liability gaps in international law and strengthened the International Criminal Court.
We are committed to advocating for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender and intersex people.
The German Foreign Office and the Ministry of Development have increasingly funded human rights projects for homosexuals abroad.
Budget support has been eliminated for states that have enacted punitive laws against homosexuality.
Asylum seekers who face appropriate penalties in their home countries will no longer be deported.
And we stand up for the free exercise of religion and oppose the persecution of religious minorities around the world.
The universality of human rights remains the guarantor of social peace, personal freedom, security and economic success.
Strengthening them - in Germany, Europe and worldwide - is our goal.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- We oppose the cultural relativization of the concept of human rights
- and for the effective enforcement of the rule of law in international relations.
- 
- We oppose any discrimination based on religion, ethnic origin, gender, disability, age or sexual orientation.
- The oppression or attack on other people and individual population groups are always attacks on the freedom of the whole society.
- 
- We will continue to resolutely oppose discrimination against lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender and intersex people in foreign and development policy and continue the policies we have started in this area.
- 
- Freedom of opinion is the basis of self-determined action and civic participation; it is a fundamental human right.
- We stand up for freedom of opinion, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press.
- 
- We are committed to the unrestricted physical and mental integrity of people.
- That is why we are firmly committed to the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and torture.
- In the fight against international terrorism, the end does not justify the means; it must not be accompanied by a restriction of human rights standards.
- We therefore oppose any attempts to restrict fundamental human rights in the name of fighting terrorism.
- 
- We advocate the worldwide outlawing of human trafficking, child labor, forced labor, forced prostitution and the use of child soldiers.
- Because physical integrity is a fundamental human right.
- Female genital mutilation interferes with this human right of women and girls in the cruelest way.
- We advocate an explicit criminalization of this crime, so that a clear signal goes out how despicable this crime is.
- 
- We aim to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in order to provide affected women with improved victim protection.
- 
- By ratifying the Additional Protocol to the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, we want to give individuals the opportunity, after exhausting national legal remedies, to use this route to claim their individual rights before an international body.
- 
o Access to clean drinking water and sanitation is essential for people's health and for their food security.
o Therefore, we advocate for a better recognition of the human right to drinking water and sanitation and support corresponding initiatives at the United Nations level.
o 
o 
- Corruption stands in the way of the implementation of human rights.
- Human rights protection therefore also includes the fight against corruption.
- We advocate ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption in conformity with the constitution.
- 
- We want to further strengthen international criminal jurisdiction - such as the International Criminal Court.
- Under the umbrella of the United Nations, we want to differentiate and further develop the concept of the responsibility to protect under international law.
- Under the pillars "to prevent, to react and to rebuild," particular importance is to be attached to strengthening prevention.
- 
- With the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, we are closing a gap in the protection of human rights in Europe.
- We will advocate the swift implementation of the accession agreement.
- The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights must be respected in all EU Member States, regardless of the political color of the respective national government.
- 
- We are committed to the European Court of Human Rights and actively support its reform.
- We want to build on our successes at the Brighton Reform Conference and will work to ensure that the reform proposals are implemented quickly.
- 
- We want to promote the OSCE's human rights work and strengthen the position of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).
- 
- We want to make a solidarity-based contribution to ensuring that Europe is a safe haven for politically persecuted people in the world.
- We therefore advocate a Europe-wide humane regulation of the fundamental right to asylum and a European distribution key for asylum seekers and recognized refugees - similar to the KÃ¶nigstein Key in Germany.
- The goal must not be the lowest common denominator.
- We want to lead the way in Germany and abolish the work permit requirement for asylum seekers as well as the residence requirement for refugees.
- Unaccompanied minor refugees should not be considered to be of legal age until they are 18.
- We will legally regulate interim legal protection in Dublin cases in such a way that it meets the requirement of effective legal protection and the requirements of the Dublin III Regulation.
- When refugees are admitted, their plight and need are the decisive factors, not their religious affiliation.
- We urge that there be clear and common provisions on safe third countries for the repatriation of rejected applicants to other EU countries.
- 
- After a long 18 years, Germany has finally withdrawn its reservations to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
- This puts the application of the law under new auspices.
- We want to take greater account of the best interests of the child for unaccompanied minor refugees and revise legal regulations to this end, for example the provisions on entry and family reunification.
- 
- 
- In Germany, we want to improve the rights of victims of trafficking in women and human beings,
- quickly and thoroughly review the situation of people without residence status in the area of health and fair pay.
- 
- 
Protecting freedom, creating opportunities - liberal security policy
In an increasingly globalized world, threats to peace, freedom, and security are becoming more and more difficult to define regionally and to categorize in terms of statehood.
Global terrorist networks, organized crime, local and regional conflicts with global implications, spread of deserts, lack of clean drinking water, famines, and extreme climate change.
- We can only meet all these global challenges in a global and networked way.
We have coordinated all relevant departments of German foreign policy more closely than ever before as part of a networked approach.
We stand by German security policy and the culture of military restraint.
And on the one hand, we have focused on disarmament
and, on the other hand, on a primarily civilian-oriented prevention policy.
Where it is nevertheless necessary, our soldiers are doing their bit for peace around the world.
For our soldiers in Afghanistan, we were able to open up a realistic withdrawal perspective for 2014 through a successful change of strategy toward stronger networking of political, developmental and military approaches.
The handover of responsibility in Afghanistan is underway.
The withdrawal of German combat troops has begun.
Even after the complete withdrawal of German combat troops from Afghanistan, we will not abandon the country.
Lack of freedom, poverty and opportunity can be breeding grounds for political and religious extremism and become the cause of conflict.
By giving more people around the world more opportunities for their own lives, we are helping to address the root causes of conflict, not its symptoms.
As more people around the world seize more opportunities, together we contribute to greater stability and lasting peace.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- The Bundeswehr is and remains a parliamentary army.
- Political objectives and timelines as well as an exit strategy must be clearly formulated before the start of operations in crisis regions.
- These must be updated for the duration of the assignment.
- 
- With the suspension of compulsory military service and the associated transformation of the Bundeswehr into a volunteer army, we have set real milestones with regard to the structure and internal constitution of the Bundeswehr.
- At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that the Bundeswehr's important work receives public recognition.
- The appreciation of the demanding and dangerous service of our soldiers is of paramount importance, especially for an army on deployment.
- We want to achieve the necessary acceptance among the population, among other things, through appropriate representation in the area.
- 
- We want to further increase the attractiveness of the service.
- Salary levels, the quality of the infrastructure, opportunities for further training, transfer frequency, care in the event of wounding, and the compatibility of service and family are key factors here.
- 
- 
- The operational capability of the Bundeswehr must be ensured through appropriate funding.
- Foreign deployments must not be at the expense of the current budget of the Ministry of Defense.
- 
- NATO will remain the strongest anchor of our common security policy in the future.
- Its capacity to act must be continuously strengthened, as must that of the other major international peace and security organizations (UN, OSCE, Council of Europe, EU).
- At the same time, we will work to establish generally accepted norms and rules in the international system and to intensify cooperation in the area of security and defense policy.
- By creating joint structures, the conditions for European armed forces under parliamentary control are to be created in the long term.
- To this end, a common understanding of security policy must be created and a balance struck between armaments policy interests.
- 
o In view of the complexity of new challenges, we want to establish a permanent focal point at Federal Government level to exchange information and coordinate military and civilian measures in all areas of foreign and security policy and to prevent and respond to national and international disasters and crises.
o The Federal Foreign Office provides a suitable basis for this structure.
o In addition to the situation analysis, the "networked approach" must be ensured and strengthened while maintaining departmental responsibility.
o In addition, parliamentary control must be ensured at all times through parliamentary involvement.
- We want to develop a national security strategy as a contribution to an EU security strategy and update it regularly.
- Only through the formulation and regular public discussion of such a strategy will it be possible to create awareness and understanding of security policy issues among a broad public.
- In an open and tolerant civil society, security policy must be more than just an issue for a few specialists.
- The political mission of the Bundeswehr must always be clearly formulated and a corresponding structure and legal certainty for the armed forces must be derived.
- In this context, the protection of Germany's territorial integrity must be
- and the separation of responsibilities between the Bundeswehr and the police must be maintained.
- We advocate a parliamentary body with full rights to information that monitors the decisions of the Federal Security Council - comparable to the procedure for monitoring the secret services.
- In future, the arms export report is to be published immediately after the reporting period.
- Control over the further whereabouts and use of exported weapons and armaments must be expanded.
- Arms control must be extended to new technologies of modern warfare, such as spyware.
- 
- In the context of civil crisis prevention and the reconstruction of state structures after a crisis, we place an emphasis on strengthening the development of civil capabilities (administration, judiciary, police).
- In addition, the instruments of development cooperation, the development of economic partnerships, police and rule-of-law cooperation and the promotion of cross-border cooperation for conflict and crisis prevention should be strengthened in the sense of a coherent policy approach.
- 
- Our goal is to strengthen nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, and conventional control and nonproliferation regimes.
- The universal application of international treaty regimes and codes of conduct is our declared goal.
- In the context of nuclear arms control in particular, we consistently advocate a comprehensive strengthening of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the entry into force of the Test Ban Treaty.
- In addition, however, we also want to break new ground in driving forward global disarmament beyond the existing conventions and, for example, actively campaign for the accession of states not party to the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention.
- We remain committed to the goal of withdrawing tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.
- 
- We will continue the handover in responsibility to the government of Afghanistan that we initiated and the withdrawal of combat troops for 2014.
- Beyond this date, we will continue to effectively support the people of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country within the framework of development cooperation.

Assuming responsibility in partnership - worldwide development cooperation
We work to ensure that more people in the world can live in freedom and have more opportunities to develop.
We know: Those who do not know today how they will live tomorrow are not free.
Because we trust in the strength of these people, we support them in improving their situation through their own efforts.
For us, individual freedom and responsibility for others are inseparable.
Development policy is also peace, human rights and security policy.
It works toward the stabilization of fragile countries and regions, acts preventively against conflicts, and thus also helps to ensure that people are not driven from their homes.
In order to align our development cooperation with this principle, we have initiated the biggest reform in the history of German development cooperation.
By merging the "Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Technische Zusammenarbeit," the "Deutscher Entwicklungsdienst" and the "Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung" to form the "Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit," we have made development cooperation more effective.
But we don't want to rest on our laurels.
We continue to work for more efficient structures in development cooperation so that every euro achieves maximum impact.
With the independent evaluation institute of German development cooperation, we laid the keystone to this reform in November 2012.
From now on, German development policy will for the first time be subject to a scientifically based, independent assessment of its activities in order to learn from the experience of its work in the long term.
In this way, we have significantly strengthened the clout of German development cooperation and enabled the targeted use of financial resources.
Effectiveness and efficiency in development cooperation are in the interest of German taxpayers as well as our international partners.
Effectiveness and efficiency in development cooperation require regionally differentiated and country-specific strategies of cooperation with our partner countries
as well as the implementation of integrated development concepts, especially in the areas of education, rural development, economy, environment, health and social security.
We have discontinued government development cooperation for China and Turkey and are prioritizing development cooperation for 50 countries instead of over 120.
We have aligned our cooperation more closely with respect for human rights and good governance,
and we have strengthened cooperation with fragile states as a peace investment.
Despite the euro crisis and successful budget consolidation, we have been able to increase development assistance by almost two billion euros since 2009 to around ten billion euros - Germany is now the world's largest donor after the USA.
Liberal development policy focuses on the individual with his or her abilities and needs.
For us, development cooperation is not charitable aid, but an investment in a better future for the people in our cooperation countries and in Germany.
Liberal development policy is both value- and interest-oriented and seeks to replace the classic donor-recipient relationship with a partnership of equals.
We do not want to provide for the developing countries, but we want to empower them to take responsibility for themselves and make provisions for the future.
In doing so, we create life opportunities for more people - for a better, freer and more peaceful future.
This is what we stand for.
That is what we stand for.
- Liberal development policy serves the goal of strengthening freedom worldwide
- and to enable all people to live in dignity, personal responsibility and self-determination.
- Poverty is lack of freedom.
- Eradicating the causes of poverty is therefore at the heart of our development cooperation.
- 
o Safeguarding human rights is and remains a priority for liberals. o
We have demonstrated this with the introduction of binding human rights monitoring for development projects. o
We want to continue to use this instrument consistently in the future:
o Germany promotes, but we also demand - more rule of law, more democracy,
o more market economy
o and more individual responsibility.
o 
- Liberal development policy is based on a triad of state, business and civil society.
- The state alone will not be able to master the development challenges of the future.
- This also applies to development financing. -
German development policy must therefore set the framework conditions in such a way that more private investment
- and more civil society involvement - are made possible.
- Together with the private sector, we want to continue to develop and implement innovative financing instruments.
- 
- The commitment of German business is an opportunity for our cooperation countries.
- We therefore want to further expand this cooperation and continue to win over German SMEs in particular as partners in development cooperation.
- 
- For us, the effectiveness of development policy is paramount.
- We are committed to the international agreements entered into.
- At the same time, the evaluation of public spending on development cooperation (ODA ratio) must be based not only on quantity, but also on qualitative criteria.
- Despite our success in increasing the development budget, the decisive factor is not how much money is spent - but how effective the measures are.
- 
- In development cooperation, we are consciously relying on broad civil society involvement from the middle of society.
- That is why we have increased funding for non-governmental organizations, churches and foundations.
- We have thinned out the jungle of funding programs and created a single point of contact for all people who want to get involved in development cooperation.
- With these reforms, we want to double the number of people involved in Germany over the next few years.
- 
- Liberal development policy responds consistently to the global shifts in power.
- This means that we must put an end to traditional poverty-oriented development cooperation with emerging economies and transform it into a new form of cooperation.
- We already took this step with China in 2010 and are continuing the dialogue at eye level, especially in the area of the rule of law.
- 
- With the Millennium Development Goals, the world has succeeded for the first time in agreeing on a common system of targets.
- However, this system of goals has its shortcomings.
- The post-2015 world agenda must overcome the juxtaposition of different goals and do justice to the close interconnection of challenges.
- Common but differentiated commitments should be agreed for developing, emerging and industrialized countries.
- 
- Within European development policy, we continue to advocate a reform of general budget support.
- In the future, we want to further tighten the criteria for budget support in order to prevent blind subsidization of corrupt governments.
- The EU should also be strengthened in its role of donor coordination.
- However, we reject the communitarization of development policy.
- The European Development Fund must also be integrated into the EU budget in order to establish the missing parliamentary control.
- We want to continue the reduction of bureaucratic structures and processes in German development aid and are committed to reducing bureaucracy, streamlining structures and speeding up processes in European development cooperation.
- 
- Too often, Africa is reduced exclusively to disasters, hunger and poverty.
- We see Africa first and foremost as a continent of opportunity with young, high-performing societies.
- Important innovations are already being created in Africa today, and economic growth in many countries far exceeds the European level.
- Liberal development policy focuses on this potential and wants to promote Africa's innovative strength. -
At the same time, we want to correct the far too negative image of Africa in Germany
- and realign development education work accordingly.
- 
- Our policy of promoting freedom is based on supporting equal access for all people to economic, social and political participation.
- In the future, we will continue to be particularly committed to helping people in our cooperation countries who are affected by exclusion, discrimination and violence.
- Ethnic and social minorities require our special support.
