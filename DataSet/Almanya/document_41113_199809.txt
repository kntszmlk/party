Preamble
Green is the change!
It's time for a change
Germany needs a new, social and ecological policy
The challenges of a new century cannot be mastered with the concepts of yesterday and the day before yesterday
Politics cannot solve all problems
But politics must play its part in solving the problems
The 1998 Bundestag election is a decisive election in this respect
You can choose between having the courage to face reality and sitting out the problems
You have the choice between preserving our natural resources and the growth of the climate catastrophe,
Between solidarity and exclusion
It's about how the future should be shaped
Alliance 90/The Greens stand for sustainability,
social justice,
Democracy
and equal rights for women
We want to modernize the Federal Republic ecologically
We want to actively combat unemployment
We want to secure the welfare state through renewal
We want to expand democracy
We want a policy that also opens up equal development opportunities for countries in the South and East
The future demands change
The conservative political model has failed on the key issues of the future
The Kohl government did not solve any problems, but exacerbated all of them and led the country into a dead end
It had not overcome the difficulties of the old Federal Republic before '89
It has not brought prosperous landscapes to the new federal states
It has squandered the opportunities to reshape a united Germany and broken its promises
The record of the CDU-led government is: record unemployment, record national debt, record bankruptcy, record impoverishment, record enrichment
Social insecurity has become generalized
Never before have so many people been dependent on social welfare
Young people lack training places, students lack textbooks and courses
The gap between rich and poor is growing
Public budgets have been cut to the bone
The private fortunes of a few are flourishing
Tax policy promotes redistribution in favor of companies and the wealthy, while placing an even greater burden on ordinary earners
Globalization had to be used as a spectre threatening the location for the cuts in the social safety net
Germany has indeed benefited from globalization
She became export vice world champion
The price is high
Growth and employment are decoupled
Labor has become more expensive
Future-oriented global market sectors such as the solar industry were driven abroad
Germany pollutes the Earth's atmosphere with climate-damaging emissions
The German government promotes car and air traffic through high subsidies
It continues to operate nuclear power plants and produce nuclear waste against the will of the majority of the population
Although the Cold War is over, the Bundeswehr has not been disarmed, but rather expensively re-equipped
The war in Bosnia and Europe's failure there were used to limit the Bundeswehr's operational options
The government is hindering its own goal of European unification
and blocks a European employment policy
The CDU/CSU and FDP are in the process of reducing the Federal Republic of Germany to a single location
Instead of democratically incorporating the interests of all those involved, it focuses on division: the employed against the unemployed, West against East, the healthy against the sick, the young against the old, men against women, Germans against foreigners, singles against families
Where the law of the strongest applies, hatred and violence are not far away
Under Kohl, racism has been made acceptable again in Germany
Five years after the arson attacks in Solingen and Lübeck, right-wing extremist violence remains a bitter daily reality
Five years after the abolition of the right of asylum, people in Germany have to seek asylum from the police in churches
Millions of citizens are still being denied their citizenship rights
But it is unmistakable: The coalition of CDU, CSU and FDP is at an end
It is no longer capable of acting
Quarrels and stagnation symbolize their politics
But this discredits politics in general
The Kohl government gives people the feeling that nothing can be changed anyway
A change for the youth
Young people's expectations of the future have changed
And "the" youth cannot be reduced to one attitude towards life
But it is particularly affected by today's political decisions
There are hardly any reliable points of orientation in young people's life planning: fear of unemployment, social decline and the destruction of the environment are unsettling
A school-leaving certificate does not guarantee a job, a job does not guarantee social security and one's own ecological actions do not guarantee a healthy life
The willingness of many young people to get involved in social, cultural and ecological issues is dampened by a lack of prospects and untrustworthy politics:
There is no money for education,
but for the financing of the Eurofighter;
Germany supposedly strives for peace in the world and at the same time profits from arms exports;
Young people see themselves labeled as violent and lazy, while the federal government and business refuse to pursue an active employment policy
Such a policy triggers a skeptical distance between the young generation and the social system in the Federal Republic of Germany
The needs, aspirations and everyday interests of young people are hardly noticed by politicians
On the contrary - the federal government's austerity policy, which is justified by alleged practical constraints, is hitting youth facilities in the east, sports facilities, training places in the public sector, schools and universities hard
Encrusted structures and old networks prevent a generational change and a social rethink
This reduces the chances of young women in particular
- The training opportunities for them emphasize classic female professions,
the recurring debate about pregnancy counseling leaves them no room to make their own decisions about their future,
a degrading policy towards foreigners pushes young migrant women in particular to the margins of society
The ruling politicians use the resulting powerlessness and anger to desolidarize society
The Greens want to counter this with a policy in which young people can have an active say and which takes their experiences and life situations seriously
We want young people to be able to intervene in the shaping of today's society and their future instead of having to adapt to traditional ways of life
With our concepts, we want to show prospects for young people and enable them to participate in politics
Greens encourage change
Disenchantment with politics is the wrong response to the paralysis of society that is being willed from above
We want to break this paralysis
It gives us confidence that many forces in society are anything but paralyzed
Trade unions, initiatives and churches work together to solve the country's social problems
Strikes and demonstrations prevented the reduction in sick pay
Young people volunteer for social years
They take part in sit-in blockades against nuclear waste transports, get involved in environmental protection or humanitarian projects
They are demonstrating for better educational opportunities, more co-determination and, with their strikes, are bringing movement to the stagnant universities
Homeless people make newspapers, unemployed people set up communities
People of all ages protect the human rights of persecuted people with their civil courage
Campaigns, such as the one against landmines, have now forced international agreements
In many cases, society is far ahead of political institutions: creative entrepreneurs and trade unionists are testing new working time models and thus redistributing work and income to everyone
Workers and employees, especially in eastern Germany, are saving their companies and their jobs by investing in companies - without waiting for great role models or thought leaders
A new policy must absorb this energy, this drive
It must have the courage to be unconventional, to build bridges, to experiment, to be new
A new policy must have the courage to address problems instead of postponing them with silence or adventurous financial constructs
A new beginning
A different policy for a different majority
The end of the Kohl era is in sight
People know that things cannot go on like this
But the fear of change is also unmistakable
The preparation of a grand coalition is aimed at this fear
However, especially with regard to young people, those who are currently well established in the system must not block the necessary social change
The grand coalition is the secret option of both the CDU and SPD
Grand coalitions mean major standstill
Ecology, social justice, democracy and equality have fallen by the wayside
The opportunity for political change would be lost for more than just four years
For young people, some of whom have experienced nothing other than a complacent chancellor who ignores or defames social movements, the willingness to actively participate in shaping society would be lost
Right-wing populists like those in Austria threaten to become parliamentary
Voter turnout would continue to fall
The grand coalition would have made itself the successor
Therefore, the alternative for 1998 is either to continue with the CDU or to make a new political start
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to completely remove the current ruling parties from power
A new political start is only possible with the red-green coalition
| A grand coalition can only be prevented if the SPD and Greens have their own majority in the new Bundestag
We know: The SPD is largely a structurally conservative party
This is why the Greens will have to push for reform in a coalition
Only a vote for the Greens is a vote for change
We add: We are not available for mere muddling through, as pure majority procurers
We want to change this country together with its citizens
We want to take up and implement their will to reform and their commitment
We know what a heavy legacy we are facing from 16 years of the Kohl government
We want to put an end to the prevailing irresponsibility towards the future
We are determined to take responsibility
To achieve this, we need your vote on election day as well as your participation and commitment afterwards
We would like to ask you for both
Green is the change
Environmental protection and nature conservation
Basis of the ecological economy
The growth society is reaching its limits: ecologically and economically The
effects of local environmental disasters have long been global - and not just since the Chernobyl supercollapse or the ecological catastrophe in Asia in the fall of 1997
The ecological costs of growth are being felt worldwide
Environmental protection is not the focus of public interest today
Achievements of the environmental movement that have long been believed to be secure are once again being called into question The
quality of life is threatening to fall by the wayside in the global distribution struggle for material prosperity, which has become tougher
Alliance 90/The Greens believe: Protecting the environment must be a priority even in difficult economic times
The Kohl government has brought environmental policy to a standstill: The federal government defines environmental protection as a luxury good that can increasingly be dispensed with in times of empty coffers
As if there had never been any international climate summits, transport collapse is expanding, German industry is exporting global environmental problems for its own profit maximization, the Kohl government is as far away from the full-bodied promise of reducing Co2 emissions by 25 percent as it is from halving the number of unemployed
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN counter this with a just reform concept of sustainability
Sustainable environmental policy creates jobs
Economic development and nature conservation can only be achieved together
This is the basic idea of a sustainable economy
Sustainable development requires not only a change in the economic course, but also far-reaching political and social changes
Germany is in an economic, ecological and social crisis
Environmental protection does not come for free - but through intelligent, sustainable incentive and steering instruments
An eco-social tax reform will set the course for sustainable, future-proof development: resource consumption will be drastically reduced
An eco-social tax reform not only reduces environmental consumption,
it also secures and creates jobs because its revenue can be used to significantly reduce non-wage labor costs
Our overall concept of an ecological-social tax reform consists of three pillars of revenue and use
On the revenue side: ? introduction of an energy tax,
? Increase in mineral oil tax and introduction of a heavy vehicle tax,
? Reduction of ecologically harmful subsidies
On the expenditure side: ? reduction in non-wage labor costs,
? Financing the transport turnaround, the expansion of bus and rail transport,
? Financing the energy transition
We want to give any surpluses back to the citizens
The ecological-social tax reform reverses the current undesirable developments:
We want to use the tax revenue to finance the reduction in non-wage labor costs: social security contributions can be reduced by 6 percentage points within 10 years
Lower labor costs due to lower non-wage labor costs secure and create jobs
An additional innovation boost in energy-saving technologies and future energies such as wind, water, solar and geothermal energy creates new jobs
The energy tax makes energy consumption more expensive, higher prices create incentives to save energy
Pollutant emissions are thus noticeably reduced
The entire concept is initially designed to run for 10 years
We want to grant adjustment aid for energy-intensive sectors during this period
and create social compensation for particularly affected households
Almost all household types are already making significant cost savings thanks to the reduction in social security contributions following the introduction of the energy tax in the tenth year - provided that energy-saving measures are taken
Low-income households are relieved proportionately more than upper income groups
People who do not pay social security contributions and therefore do not benefit from a reduction (the unemployed, pensioners, welfare recipients and students) receive social compensation
Energy-saving technologies for the efficiency revolution, electricity and heat from wind, sun, geothermal energy and biogas, modern transportation systems for buses and trains, the 3-liter car, new construction and materials, durable and repair-friendly products, new services and much more - all of this opens up great opportunities for a creative economy and will create new jobs
The future begins today
If you want to stay ahead in future technologies, you have to initiate ecological innovations today
The environmental problems will not be solved by an ecological innovation offensive alone
People's behavior must also change: Doing without can mean a gain in quality of life
In order for environmentally friendly behavior to be worthwhile for everyone and for ecologically innovative products to find a sales market, the state must change the framework conditions
Environmental protection in a global economy has not become any easier
Government action remains essential to tackle ecological problems
Alliance 90/The Greens are therefore calling for a National Environmental Plan
It is intended to bring all social groups together to develop goals and measures on the path to a sustainable society
and to provide industry with appropriate stimuli and investment security for innovation and research
Ecological policy is not limited to environmental protection
It is the decisive cross-sectional task that will secure the future of society
Alliance 90/The Greens call for an ecological financial, economic, transport and research policy so that economic interests such as environmental protection become economic interests
This also opens up opportunities for an "ecological technology reform" for eastern Germany:
What is needed here is a sustainable economic policy framework that combines ecological restoration and ecological modernization with social aspects, above all the creation of future-oriented and sustainable jobs
Eastern Germany thus has the opportunity to become an EU-wide leading region for sustainable management and environmental remediation and services
By establishing a world-leading environmental sector in the new countries, it is possible to gain a competitive edge on international markets through proven expertise
Work and the environment do not have to be opposites
In the context of sustainable development, environmental protection can create jobs in many areas, especially in the service sector
In this way, we want to replace those jobs that are lost as a result of ecological structural change
Sustainable development also includes further reductions in working hours in order to secure jobs and create new ones
Transport turnaround: For sustainable mobility
The decades-long political preference for car traffic must be brought to an end
Traffic problems cannot be solved by building new roads
For us, the environmental alliance has priority: Rail, bus, car sharing, cycling and walking An
environmentally and socially compatible transport policy aims to ensure freedom of movement for all people At
the same time, it must reduce energy and land consumption, as well as pollutant and noise emissions The
introduction of a traffic turnaround with inexpensive and regionally well-connected rail and bus services is a prerequisite for changing traffic behavior and making greater use of the services of the environmental alliance
Through sensible spatial planning and urban development, the areas of living, working, supply and leisure can be brought closer together again
Traffic avoidance is the top priority
Eco-taxes in transport -
good for the environment, good for the economy
The vision of sustainable mobility requires a transportation system that is ecologically and economically efficient
In order to limit traffic and reduce environmental pollution, we want prices to reflect the ecological truth
Therefore, road traffic in particular must bear all consequential costs, e.g. for infrastructure, environmental and building damage, itself
In order to come closer to true-cost pricing in the long term, we need an environmentally oriented tax policy in the transport sector
As part of the overall concept of an ecological-social tax reform, we therefore consider a gradual and predictable increase in mineral oil tax to be necessary
An increase in the mineral oil tax as part of a 10-year ecological-social tax reform is a socially acceptable means of initiating the transport transition
We want a one-off increase in fuel tax of 50 pfennigs in the first year and a gradual increase of 30 pfennigs in each of the following years
According to our concept, 1 liter of gasoline would cost around 5 DM after 10 years
The gradual increase enables the economy and consumers to adapt to the increase and their products and purchasing decisions to the development within a manageable period of time
We know that the ecological reorientation we are striving for will have to face the electoral decision of the citizens repeatedly over a period of 10 years
The long-term goals can only be achieved with their long-term consent
That is why we are already clearly stating where the journey should take us
In the legislative period ahead of us, an effective start must be fought for
For integrated transport planning
The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan has failed and cannot be financed
Car-focused road construction has created huge budget holes at federal, state and local level
BÜNDNIS 90/ DIE GRÜNEN want integrated - ecological and economic - transport planning
We want to reallocate funds from highway and trunk road construction to the expansion and repair of regional infrastructure
This includes cycle paths and railway lines as well as municipal and rural roads in eastern Germany
We reject private financing for road construction
We are striving to reduce car traffic in city centers
and particularly want to improve the situation of children in road traffic
The municipalities' political options for road safety and traffic calming must be expanded
Speed limits in particular are required to improve road safety and reduce emissions: 100 km/h on highways, 80 km/h on rural roads and 30 km/h in urban areas
We want to reverse the Federal Ministry of Transport's toleration of drunk driving
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN advocate 0.0 per mille in road traffic
Combat traffic noise
We are committed to effective active and passive noise abatement
Limit values for noise pollution must be lowered significantly, and nighttime quiet must be protected
Measurement and assessment methods must be changed to capture the real burden
As a first step in noise abatement, we want to enforce speed limits, bans on night flights, a new version of the Air Traffic Noise Act and a "Noise Abatement Program for Railways," as well as a lowering of the limit values for noise abatement on roads in the Federal Immission Control Act
Reduce air traffic
Alliance 90/The Greens want a significant reduction in global air traffic in the medium term
We will consistently campaign against the expansion of air traffic capacities in Germany and will focus on cooperation between airports rather than competition between them
We will present a national air traffic concept that will largely shift short-haul air traffic within Germany to the railroads
In addition to levying a kerosene tax, we want to assess landing fees according to noise and pollutant emissions
and promote alternatives to tourist air traffic, which accounts for 70% of air traffic in Germany
In highly polluted, densely populated areas, we want to set a binding limit on the number of aircraft movements in order to protect the population
Citizen friendly area railroad
In order to create the conditions for privatization, Deutsche Bundesbahn was divided into profitable and loss-making divisions
The promises of cost transparency and equal rights for all modes of transport were not kept
Deutsche Bahn AG charges high track access charges for the use of its railroad lines, the justification for which cannot be verified
Road freight transport does not cover the travel costs it causes
Transport policy reform is more necessary than ever
To prevent further line closures, responsibility for the rail network must remain in public hands
Use and management can be put out to competitive tender step by step
Prices for the use of routes must be based on the route-specific costs
Discrimination against small railroads must be ended
We want an attractive, citizen-friendly surface railroad
To achieve this, we need dense connections between local, regional and long-distance trains operated by Deutsche Bahn AG and all other rail companies
High-speed lines make sense as part of such a concept if they are planned in an environmentally friendly and economical way
We reject the construction of the Hamburg-Berlin Transrapid line
It makes no sense in terms of transport and economic policy and burdens Deutsche Bahn and the federal government with billions in risks
Our alternative proposal: upgrading the Hamburg-Berlin link to an ICE route
Goods on rail
In order to reduce truck and air freight traffic and shift it to rail and ship, we will promote modern freight transport logistics, electronic operations control systems and decentralized, fast transhipment terminals
We also want to charge truck traffic with a performance-based heavy goods vehicle tax
Inland waterway transport as a means of mass transport is an environmentally compatible alternative to road transport if the ships are adapted to the rivers - and not vice versa
We reject further river expansion
Making tourism sustainable
With improved framework conditions, tourism could provide important impetus for sustainable economic activity in Germany
After all, two million jobs and 200 billion deutschmarks in sales depend on tourism in Germany
But the government has failed to set the course in the right direction: The tax exemption for kerosene has led to a doubling of climate-damaging air travel in the last 10 years
While 35% of the population still spent their vacations in Germany in 1990, the figure is now only 27%
Instead of countering this trend, the German government has further exacerbated the crisis with its rigorous austerity policy
We want to counteract the environmentally harmful trend in air tourism and make tourism as a whole more environmentally and socially compatible
In addition to a change in transportation for vacations by train, bus, bicycle, ship and on foot, cooperation between the players in the regions must be strengthened To achieve this,
tourism in Germany needs new - green - ideas!
The urgently needed reform of tourism subsidies is intended to fill existing guest beds instead of promoting new investment ruins
The criteria for awarding subsidies must be consistently changed to overcome parochial thinking in the tourism regions and to high environmental standards
Large-scale leisure projects should only be approved in small numbers and subject to compliance with strict environmental requirements;
Instead, promising approaches to linking small and medium-sized hospitality businesses, agriculture and crafts should be promoted
At an international level, we are committed to more sustainable tourism in the Mediterranean destinations and in developing countries
Binding international agreements must put a stop to coastal development, the destruction of nature reserves and the waste of resources caused by mass tourism
We demand more decisive measures against prostitution tourism and in particular the sexual exploitation of children
This terrible crime must finally be combated effectively through bilateral mutual legal assistance agreements and aid for the families affected in developing countries
Sustainable tourism is largely dependent on consumer behavior; we will therefore enable more transparent travel decisions by introducing the "Green Suitcase" environmental seal of approval
An information campaign in line with the green motto "travel less, stay longer, experience more intensively" aims to provide impetus for sustainable travel behavior
Energy transition: a country for the sun
Energy management based on nuclear power and the burning of fossil fuels in large power plants has no future
It is risky, wasteful and full of cynicism towards our children and our children's children
The German government has submitted to an energy lobby that has secured its power on the basis of a centralized large power plant structure
Kohl promised to reduce C02 emissions by 25% by 2005
But this promise can only be kept with green policies
The time is ripe for an energy turnaround
We rely on new, decentralized structures in the energy industry We
rely on the economical and rational use of energy and on regenerative energy sources
The green energy turnaround protects the climate
and creates new jobs in research, production and in the trades
Green policy puts an end to the blocking of future-oriented energy technologies and shows that it is possible to be in the black with green ideas
So that the energy turnaround can also and especially take place in the poorer countries of the world, we want to set up an international climate protection fund from which energy-saving measures and regenerative energy sources can be financed
Phasing out nuclear power
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want an immediate phase-out of nuclear energy
The ongoing social opposition to nuclear energy expresses it: Instead of the permanent risk of a super-GAU, the legacy of thousands of years of radiating, highly toxic waste for future generations, and the threat of mixing civilian and military use of nuclear technology, the majority of society in Germany wants a fundamental reorientation in energy policy
The power supply in Germany would also be ensured, if all reactors (nuclear power plants) were shut down immediately
We will use all available administrative, economic and legislative means, such as a nuclear phase-out law, to implement the demand for immediate phase-out The
aim is to achieve decommissioning without compensation, However, this must not become a condition for the nuclear phase-out We
also aim to achieve the same for nuclear research reactors We
want to end the plutonium economy associated with reprocessing as quickly as possible
Spent fuel elements must be stored temporarily in the nuclear power plants
We advocate a ban on the export of nuclear waste
There is currently no safe storage for nuclear waste
A responsible final storage concept that takes into account the safety interests of many generations is only possible once the final phase-out has been decided and the quantities of nuclear waste that will be produced have been determined
We want to see a halt to all so-called "final storage projects" such as those in Morsleben, Gorleben or the Konrad mine.
Tapping energy-saving potential
A key prerequisite for success in climate protection is also to put an end to energy wastage in Germany
The energy-saving potential that can be tapped cost-effectively and without loss of quality of life through thermal insulation, electricity savings and more efficient energy use is estimated at almost half of our current total demand
To tap this potential, we want to make the use of energy more expensive as part of the ecological-social tax reform
Because only cost-justified prices provide incentives for the economical and rational use of energy We
will stipulate the low-energy construction method for new buildings
and launch a state-supported refurbishment program for the existing building stock
Promote renewable energy -
Transforming coal regions in an environmentally friendly way
The alternative to nuclear power is not a climate catastrophe, but energy-saving measures and the massive expansion of renewable energies
The share of fossil fuels in energy consumption must fall significantly in the medium term
We want to gradually and predictably reduce coal subsidies, which are neither justifiable in terms of climate nor budgetary policy, and increasingly use the funds released for the environmentally and socially compatible restructuring of coal regions
The final phase-out of coal subsidies must then be completed by 2010
We reject the development and expansion of opencast lignite mines that destroy nature
Break up monopolies
The dissolution of energy monopolies and the separation of energy generation, transport and distribution create the preconditions for a real energy turnaround
Fair competition, non-discriminatory access to the electricity and gas grids, and priority regulations for electricity produced from renewable sources and efficiently in combined heat and power generation enable new, independent suppliers to compete with the existing energy monopolies
This protects the climate and strengthens decentralized and municipal energy supply
Our parliamentary group in the Bundestag has submitted a corresponding draft bill
Environmentally friendly agriculture,
healthy food and economic strengthening of rural regions
The agricultural policies of the German government and the European Union are increasingly being rejected by consumers and farmers
Job losses, falling incomes, factory farming, food scandals and an impenetrable jungle of subsidies make it clear that a change to sustainable agriculture is overdue
Securing jobs through ecological management
Every year, more than 100|000 jobs are lost in agriculture and horticulture
This permanent loss hits rural regions particularly hard
Only ecological modernization can stop this trend
The demand for healthy and regionally produced food is increasing
Mass production of raw materials from intensive farming must be replaced by environmentally friendly, consumer-oriented quality production
Jobs can be secured and created through the increased labor requirements in environmentally friendly production processes, ecological farming and species-appropriate animal husbandry
We will support this development through a social-ecological agricultural program
Healthy environment - healthy animals - healthy food
Sufficient quantities of high-quality food can be produced without the current use of pesticides, mineral fertilizers, imported feed and genetic engineering
Regional marketing and processing concepts avoid traffic and strengthen regional economic cycles
Species-appropriate and soil-bound animal husbandry is an inseparable part of environmentally friendly agriculture for ecological and ethical reasons
We want to improve transparency and safety for consumers through clear labeling regulations for food
Organic farming best meets these goals and is particularly promoted, but we support every step towards improved environmental, consumer and animal protection in agriculture.
Reform European agricultural policy
Environmentally friendly production methods and socially acceptable working conditions must be enforced in Europe and worldwide
Protecting the basis of life and securing the world's food supply are the goals that the world trade organizations (WTO, GATT) have to face up to
The conditions of global trade in agricultural commodities must take these requirements into account
The global market orientation of European agricultural policy combined with price dumping prevents the development of local agriculture in many poorer countries
The subsidization of European agriculture, which is inextricably linked to this policy, is no longer financially viable and is making farmers increasingly dependent on state budgets
The aim of the Green Party's agricultural policy is to replace the current world market orientation with a more European internal market
Prices for agricultural products must tell the truth economically and ecologically
Farmers should be able to generate their income primarily from the sale of their products rather than from state transfer payments
The current subsidy jungle needs to be cleared
Subsidy payments to agriculture must be linked to clear ecological, employment-creating and regional economic conditions
We want to save a considerable proportion of the subsidies for warehousing and export subsidies and use them to support democratic developments in Eastern European countries.
and social,
economic
and ecological reforms
Food from the gene lab - No thanks!
Alliance 90/The Greens reject genetic engineering in agriculture and food production
The European Union's Novel Food Regulation serves solely to market genetically engineered products and not to protect consumers
As a result of the EU Commission's policy, more and more foods produced using genetic engineering are reaching the market unlabeled
This fraud on consumers is supported by the other parties
Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance 90/The Greens) demand an extended labeling obligation beyond the Novel Food Regulation (v|a| enzymes and other additives)
As long as the phase-out of genetic engineering has not been completed, at least minimum ecological and health standards must be maintained
All genetically modified foods and additives must be tested according to a standardized procedure for their requirements and product safety
Against the secrecy of the EU bodies, we demand public participation in the approval process
Food must be safe and pose no risk to people or the environment
Genetic engineering legislation must be tightened up and the precautionary principle enforced
Not everything that is applied for may be approved
We want effective liability regulations and compulsory insurance for GMO operators
Releases of genetically engineered plants, animals and microorganisms are irresponsible and their consequences cannot be controlled
Genetic engineering is genetic pollution
Its consequences are uncontrollable and therefore unjustifiable
Waste prevention instead of waste management
The top priority of our waste policy is to avoid waste
Green waste policy requires a decisive step towards a new way of thinking about products, a new philosophy of industrial production
Products must be manufactured to be durable, recyclable and easy to repair from a sustainable perspective
We want comprehensive product responsibility on the part of manufacturers and the take-back of used appliances
Product stewardship can be an instrument for securing sustainable jobs
Waste that cannot be avoided must, as far as possible, be recycled according to environmentally friendly criteria
We want to amend the Circular Economy Act to introduce a hierarchy of recycling routes
The incineration of waste or underground transportation may no longer be considered recovery
We will put an end to the current "waste pyromania" through an amendment to the Waste Management Act
Waste management must finally be turned on its head: As local and regional authorities have to guarantee minimum quantities of waste for incineration plants, whatever is possible will be incinerated
At the same time, the fees increase, as this compensates for the lack of waste volumes
Cooperation between municipalities across administrative boundaries in the use of existing waste disposal facilities must make optimum use of existing capacities
Before planning new disposal facilities, all reasonable waste prevention measures must first be demonstrated
The product responsibility of manufacturers as the core of every prevention effort must be concretized from chemical products to complex consumer goods via prevention, take-back and recycling concepts
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN focus on material recycling| V
We reject incineration as thermal treatment and recycling
Both counteract avoidance strategies, are extremely expensive and lead to high fees
The emissions increase the greenhouse effect and release pollutants that cannot be recovered
Existing plants are to be decommissioned in the medium term and new ones no longer expanded
This is the only way to focus on product and production-integrated waste prevention
Only waste that cannot be avoided and recycled must be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner
We reject the dumping of untreated, biochemically active waste and want to stop it immediately
At the same time, the legal requirements, in particular the TA-Siedlungsabfall (Technical Instructions on Municipal Solid Waste), must be amended so that the waste treatment market is open to new, ecologically compatible processes
We consider the export of waste to countries in the East or the South to be irresponsible
Through strict controls and by eliminating the existing possibilities to re-declare waste as a raw material or economic good, we will prevent the export of our "filth"
Alliance 90/The Greens are committed to decentralized and environmentally friendly solutions for the treatment of household wastewater
Solutions that are socially acceptable must be found, especially in eastern Germany, where consumers are being asked to pay for the misguided wastewater policy of the federal government, federal states and municipalities with completely excessive charges
Remediate contaminated sites
The currently most common form of remediation of contaminated sites as mere safeguarding represents an irresponsible burden on the future, which only shifts problems into the future of our children
We want to set up a fund fed by industry to ensure the remediation of contaminated sites
The federal government must assume full responsibility for armaments and military contaminated sites and ensure their remediation
The goal of remediation of contaminated sites must move away from pure hazard prevention to a precautionary approach to the non-replicable resource of soil
We aim to ensure the multifunctionality of our soils
Chemical turnaround - the ecological chemical industry
An active chemicals policy is an essential component of a policy of sustainability
It is closely interlinked with economic and labor market policy
Bündnis 90/DIE GRÜNEN are in favor of an efficient, future-oriented chemical industry that drastically reduces the use of energy and materials through intelligent products, chemical services and system-integrated processes, reduces the variety of materials used and sets new technological standards, including for export
As a basis for planning political measures, a material flow management system is required that records material and chemical flows and promotes their minimization
A modern ecological chemical industry works according to the principles of substance minimization, substance recycling and ecological design of chemicals and substances
We will massively support research in this direction
Chemical policy is also product policy
In addition to the environmentally harmful and carcinogenic potential of certain chemicals, the hormone-like effects of substances represent a newly recognized threat of unimagined proportions
The chemical industry must also take full responsibility for its products outside the factory gates
To achieve this, we need a comprehensive chemical transition that includes a ban on PVC as part of a gradual phase-out of chlorine chemicals
We will promote the broad substitution of PVC products and alternatives to chemicals containing bromine or chlorine
Sustainable urban and regional development
The Federal Republic of Germany is characterized by urban sprawl: Settlement development is characterized by a progressive urbanization process
The reasons for this are, on the one hand, the continuing unchecked use of land by industry, large-scale retail and traffic and, on the other hand, the continuing influx into the conurbations and the individual consumption of living space
The ecological consequences of this development are increasing soil consumption and sealing, the decline of natural areas and areas used for local recreation or climate protection
More and more car journeys to workplaces, shopping facilities and leisure activities are increasing traffic and environmental pollution, particularly as a result of noise emissions and air pollutants
While business parks, shopping centers, water parks and residential areas are being built on greenfield sites, established city centers and district centers have to fight for their survival
With its strategy of deregulation, privatization, social desolidarization and cost transfer to the municipal level, the federal government has abdicated its responsibility for social and ecological urban and regional development
Neither the amendment of building and regional planning law nor the reform plans for housing, tenancy and tax law open up efficient scope for action for the sustainable development of cities and regions
From building and planning law, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen will develop a land use law that is not based on building, but on ensuring environmentally sound land use
Ecological and social concerns must be integrated into planning at all levels
Land law reform
The mismanagement of space cannot be countered by planning alone
The land price gap is one of the causes of urban sprawl
We want to achieve a reduction in the land price gap in order to strengthen the internal development of settlements and limit urban sprawl
The property tax should be replaced by a land value tax
The nationwide introduction of planning value equalization is intended to give local authorities the opportunity to absorb increases in the value of land
Public land is increasingly to be made available for use on a leasehold basis
The criteria for the privatization of formerly state-owned land by the trustee successor BVVG must be fundamentally changed and made transparent
In accordance with the Unification Treaty and the rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court, agricultural land must be sold in such a way that the results of the land reform are not reversed
East German farmers must be given an equal opportunity to acquire land that they have previously farmed on reasonable terms
Healthy forests and nature conservation are social responsibilities, and the public good must take precedence over private interests
We therefore firmly reject the sale of large areas of trust forests and land in nature conservation areas
Ecological planning and building
All funding measures should be based on ecological criteria with regard to the buildability of the property, the choice of building materials and the possibility of saving energy and drinking water
We want to improve structural thermal insulation with an energy-saving ordinance,
Strengthen the use of renewable energies u
nd optimize the use of the energy-saving potential of the system technology
Our aim is to achieve a low-energy standard in new and existing buildings
The introduction of a "building energy passport" is intended to encourage energy saving through cost benefits
We will activate a thermal insulation program that promotes ecological
Combines quality objectives with job creation
Alliance 90/The Greens promote the development of environmentally friendly building materials - especially the use of local timber
We will oblige public construction and public construction funding to comply with ecological quality targets
Nature and landscape protection
More than half of the animals and plants in Germany are now considered endangered or threatened with extinction
The German government has not been able to stop this process of nature destruction - and, with regard to its lobby, has not wanted to stop it
The amendment to the Federal Nature Conservation Act proposed by the governing coalition is a step backwards from positions already achieved
Nature and landscape needs protection
As long as the consumption of nature and the destruction of established landscape structures continues almost unchecked, nature and landscape conservation is needed as a corrective measure
In the next legislative period, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen will once again present a bill for modern nature and landscape conservation that meets the challenges of the 21st century and ensures that all land use in the future is compatible with nature and the landscape
The way to comprehensive nature and landscape conservation is to extensify land use,
which is initiated and flanked by the redirection of subsidies
Nature also needs protected retreats with the highest habitat quality
In the long term and step by step, at least 10% of the land area is to be developed as priority areas for nature conservation
Sufficient space for natural development without human influence must also be provided there
Public ownership of land provides a good basis for this
The large protected area program of the eastern German federal states offers good starting points for this and for a coordinated coexistence of people and nature
It should therefore be transferred nationwide
In the biosphere reserves and nature parks, land use is to be adapted to natural conditions as a model
In national parks, the protection of nature must take precedence over other interests
On large-scale post-mining areas, more nature conservation-oriented renaturation can create magnificent new natural landscapes and at the same time save considerable financial resources
Suitable areas from the existing military training areas that have been taken out of operation are to be secured as protected areas
The protection of geotopes as abiotic natural phenomena must also be part of comprehensive nature and landscape conservation.
and the preservation of the diversity of different cultural landscapes
The implementation of the EU nature conservation directives that have long since been adopted must finally be enshrined in national law
We also want to introduce binding regulations to strengthen the position of nature conservation authorities and their planning instruments in relation to construction, transportation, excavation and military projects
Nature conservation thrives on the democratic participation and cooperation of all those involved, which is why we will expand opportunities for participation,
Propose improved procedures for citizen participation
and enforce the nationwide establishment of the right to sue associations
Forest use and protection
The forest must be preserved and developed as a near-natural habitat
Forest utilization and management must be oriented in such a way that monostructured forests are converted into permanent forests with a near-natural species composition, age structure and proportion of deadwood as well as natural regeneration
Natural forest reserves in which no human use is permitted are to be established across the board
Care must be taken to ensure that these areas are connected to each other or to other biotopes
Natural biodiversity is to be developed in such a way that the use of biocides becomes unnecessary in the interplay of ecological balance
Reducing air pollutants is a prerequisite for limiting forest dieback
The public good must also take precedence over private interests when it comes to forests
A healthy forest is a social responsibility
We therefore reject the large-scale sale of privately owned trust forests without public pre-emption rights
Improve water quality
The Water Resources Act must take precautionary measures into account:
For reasons of nature and groundwater protection, but especially flood protection, far-reaching measures to improve water quality are necessary,
for the regeneration of moors and watercourses and their floodplains
and for the restoration of still waters and their catchment areas
Groundwater quality must be improved in large parts of the country, groundwater lowering must be avoided, groundwater extraction must be minimized
The watercourses are to be developed back into "lifelines" of the landscape and their natural floodplains restored as far as possible
The transport function of waterways should be limited to the existing developed waterways
Precautionary and sustainable marine and coastal protection is geared towards minimizing substance inputs
Protect floors
Although soil forms the basis of our lives, there is no effective legal protection for it
ALLIANCE90/THE GREENS will introduce a Soil Protection Act that effectively protects soils from sealing, compaction and poisoning
Remediation of contaminated sites must not only be planned with the next use in mind, Thegoal must be healthy soils
More and more soil continues to be sealed through land grabbing
Nonsensical construction and traffic planning should be curbed by an ecological levy system (sealing levy)
Unnecessary sealing must be deconstructed
Protect animals
For Alliance 90/The Greens, ecological policy and the demand for non-violence also means giving animals an independent right as living beings
The current Animal Welfare Act does not meet this requirement
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN have therefore proposed a comprehensive amendment to the Animal Welfare Act
and presented a bill to enshrine animal protection in the constitution, creating the conditions for a significant reduction in animal testing
A balance between animal welfare and the fundamental right to freedom of research is only possible when
All possibilities for reducing animal testing must be consistently exploited
For example, laws that prescribe animal testing must be amended, animal-free test methods that have already been developed must be released and research in this direction must be stepped up
We reject the genetic manipulation and cloning of animals
The use of genetically modified animals as "spare parts stores" is unacceptable for health and ethical reasons
We need species-appropriate animal husbandry in all areas
There is a lack of political framework conditions such as an effective ban on torture and aggression breeding and sufficient controls
The breeding, trade and keeping of animals should be limited as far as possible to domesticated animal species for which it is possible to keep them in a manner that approximates their species
Industrial intensive livestock farming such as the caging of laying hens, poultry fattening and the cramped housing of pigs and cattle on slatted floors as well as the torturous transportation of animals for almost unlimited periods of time are unacceptable
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate the abolition of subsidies for the export of live animals.
and the abolition of the slaughter premium for newborn calves
Abuses and excesses in hunting must be stopped
and legislative measures against the breeding of precious fur animals are necessary
The Federal Republic of Germany must work internationally to protect species and combat the extinction of species, e.g. through hunting and overfishing
Sustainable management -
Ways out of the employment and financial crisis
The economic and financial policies of recent years will leave a difficult legacy for the future government: around 7 million| women and men are looking for work
4.5 million| are registered as unemployed
The national debt has doubled within just a few years
Today, one in five marks of the federal budget has to be spent on interest
Despite high nominal income tax rates, the tax rate and therefore government revenue is falling
The burden of social security contributions is the highest in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany
Nevertheless, social security income is falling
Employees' incomes are stagnating or even declining
Growth is becoming increasingly capital-intensive and is bypassing the labor market
Last but not least, there are growing "climate debts": Greenhouse gas emissions are rising - despite the promise of a 25% reduction by 2005
Global competition has intensified
Companies are dividing their production sites more and more flexibly among industrialized countries
Germany is still one of the leading export nations, especially for higher-value products
German companies are among the beneficiaries of the increasing international division of labor
The trade surplus has increased enormously in recent years
Nevertheless, cost competition has increased,
domestic demand is too weak and
the development of new structures is neglected
Many of these problems are homemade
In the ninth year of German reunification, the dreams of blooming landscapes have finally come to an end
The Federal Government has driven Germany into a dangerous downward spiral
Dare more sustainability -
assume political responsibility
Alliance 90/The Greens take their responsibility for future generations very seriously, and not just when it comes to environmental issues.
without further widening the gap between rich and poor, both nationally and internationally We
want development that allows the needs of the present to be met in such a way that the needs of future generations can still be satisfied
Environmental and social compatibility of our economic and lifestyles must become the central yardstick for national and international sustainability
This requires a new system of indicators in which the gross national product takes a back seat as a measure of prosperity
economic and financial policy, state action must offer the actors a clear and predictable framework Economic policy
must promote equal rights for women and minorities
Preservation of the social consensus, an efficient ecological, economic, social and cultural infrastructure are indispensable The
state does not have to do everything - but only the rich can afford a poor state
ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS want? a state that allows for the realization of different lifestyles and guarantees equal opportunities,
? an internationally cooperative welfare state, and
? an efficient administration that does not create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.
Renewing the market economy ecologically and socially
Alliance 90/The Greens are committed to an economic and technological concept that renews the market economy ecologically and socially and in terms of gender equality
The problems of the present and future cannot be solved with yesterday's recipes
The neoliberal supply-side policy of the Kohl government has failed:
Tax relief for high earners, redistribution from the bottom to the top and the dismantling of workers' rights have not led to additional jobs despite economic growth
After years of declining net income for employees, it is necessary to strengthen purchasing power and thus domestic demand
Under the conditions of globalization, however, it alone is not a way out that will lead to ecological structural change and more employment
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN rely on a combination of supply-,
Demand
and fair distribution policy
We are committed to ecological structural change,
a fair distribution of work,
Solidarity-based financing of the community
and cooperative framework conditions, also at international level
The sole focus of economic policy on economic growth is abandoned
To this end, the goal of economic growth is to be replaced by the goal of sustainable development in the Stability and Growth Act
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want: ? an ecological structural change that encompasses services, products and production processes
To achieve this, we need an ecological-social tax reform that reduces the burden on labor and the consumption of resources and rewards resource conservation
? Distributing domestic, family and paid work fairly
enable all women and men to participate in working life and secure their livelihoods
? An efficient and transparent income tax reform that closes tax loopholes
and life with children easier and financially supported
? Fair competition that promotes innovation, acts as a corrective to the concentration of economic power and improves market entry opportunities
? Planning security for the reconstruction of the East
and an economic policy that promotes the strengths of the regions and offsets the disadvantages
? More democracy in the economy
? A sustainable budget policy that sets social and ecological priorities and stabilizes revenues
? A fair distribution of profits
and the promotion of employee participation in productive assets
? Fair competition in Europe that counteracts the dumping tendencies in the European internal market and ends the tax reduction and subsidy race
Reverse the trend with eco-taxes
and create new jobs
An important lever for making industrial society fit for the future is the ecological-social tax reform
Environmentally friendly behavior is to be rewarded and employment promoted
Labor is to be made cheaper, energy more expensive and resources saved In
this way, we also want to achieve that the rationalization compulsion is transferred from labor to energy
Not people, but kilowatt-hours are to become unemployed
Reduce ancillary wage costs
Alliance 90/The Greens have an alternative to the permanent increase in non-wage labor costs, which is also the result of incorrect financing of German unification: a well-calculated concept of an ecological-social tax reform, designed for ten years, in predictable steps with predictable increases in tax rates
Part of this tax reform is the introduction of an energy tax, an increase in mineral oil tax and the reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies
Energy to become more expensive
That is one side
But not everything
It's the context that counts: BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to use the revenue from the energy tax to reduce social security contributions and have non-insurance benefits financed by all taxpayers, not just employees and employers
This increases net wages
and the competitiveness of companies improves
Strengthen environmentally compatible alternatives| Maintain competitiveness
Eco-taxes are the basis for a major ecological-social innovation that can open up markets and create sustainable jobs
Falling labor costs and rising energy costs stimulate demand for energy-saving investments and make it possible to offer them at lower prices
Craft enterprises that specialize in energy-saving services benefit just as much as mechanical engineering companies or engineering firms
In the automotive industry, demand for fuel-saving models will rise - a necessary incentive for series production of the 3-liter car
The ecological-social tax reform is the policy concept, that will endure even under the conditions of globalization
Additional demand for public transport services, heat insulation and heating modernization will directly benefit the domestic labor market Reducing
non-wage labor costs will enable companies to cut costs and thus boost their competitiveness
For particularly energy-intensive industries in which the reduction in non-wage labor costs cannot compensate for the increase in energy costs, adjustment assistance is envisaged - as long as there is no European harmonization
Provide social compensation
Employees and taxpayers can offset the increased energy costs through the tax reduction
Energy-saving measures are therefore worthwhile
Unemployment benefits and pensions will also increase if social security contributions are reduced
For social welfare recipients, students and the socially disadvantaged, an increase in transfer payments - in particular housing benefit and standard social welfare rates - is planned
Future of work gestlaten -
Distribute work fairly
The German government is facing a shambles in terms of employment policy
Deregulation and social cuts have actively promoted mass unemployment
The so-called austerity packages have not created a single job
The exclusion of millions from the labor market endangers the foundations of democracy
Chancellor words such as "leisure park" and campaigns against the "abuse" of the social security system or against foreign workers turn those affected into culprits
Alliance 90/The Greens will not accept discrimination against the unemployed
Mass unemployment cannot be overcome with the conventional methods of economic and labor market policy
The economic growth rates that would be necessary to compensate for the rationalization potential of modern technology cannot be achieved, nor are they ecologically justifiable
Full employment must be redefined
Employment biographies will become even more diverse and individualized in the future
The idea of the male "normal employee" - 49 years, 40 hours a week in the company - is no longer suitable as a social model
For Alliance 90/The Greens, full employment means opening up living wage participation for all jobseekers, women and men alike
The future lies in a new distributive justice in order to legally and financially secure the various forms of gainful employment and other productive activities such as family and care work and phases of qualification, to dovetail them and to facilitate transitions
We want to eliminate discrimination against migrants and people with disabilities, as well as work bans for asylum seekers
Alliance 90/The Greens do not accept unemployment as a structural feature of society
Combating mass unemployment is a priority for Alliance 90/The Greens
We are focusing on three main areas of labor policy: ? Distribute work fairly,
? Create work,
? Financing work in solidarity
Politics alone cannot overcome mass unemployment
The collective bargaining partners have a central role to play in reshaping work and combating mass unemployment
We see the trade unions and progressive employers as partners
In 1996, the federal government rejected the trade union offer of an alliance for work - and restricted statutory sick pay and protection against dismissal
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to reverse the "austerity package" and fully reintroduce the bad weather allowance
Alliance 90/The Greens want to increase political responsibility for employment policy
, reverse the cuts and impositions in the Employment Promotion Reform Act and in Social Code III
We are committed to a broad social alliance for work that, with the 1998 policy change, takes up the idea of a joint and solidary effort to overcome the crisis
We want to work together with the unemployment initiatives to achieve this
Reduction in working hours -
an important step towards more employment
Alliance 90/The Greens want to create incentives to reduce working hours and support the reduction of working hours in all its forms - not least through social security and regulatory support
The necessary framework conditions include a revision of the Working Hours Act, which permits working hours of up to 60 hours per week
The statutory upper limit for regular weekly working hours must be reduced to 40 hours - in times of collective agreements with weekly working hours of 35 hours,
the scope for overtime must be significantly reduced in favor of new jobs
When reforming the Working Hours Act, we will take into account the numerous flexible working time models that have been developed by collective agreements and companies, insofar as they are linked to the interests of those affected
and serve the goal of a fairer distribution of work
This can lead to a wide range of optional working hours and models such as job sharing, leave of absence or individual reductions in working hours for further training, childcare and care, as well as new models of "part-time work for the elderly and young professionals"
The central principles of the necessary legal anchoring are the fundamental voluntary nature of individual reductions in working hours with the right to return and the legal equality of full-time and part-time employees
In view of the changed conditions of flexible working hours, collective protection and planning rights must be expanded
This primarily involves access to annual working time accounts and access to time recording systems
as well as the protection of working time credits in the event of insolvencies and company changes
The introduction of transitional labor markets and legally and socially secure rotation rules can open up ways out of permanent unemployment and new employment potential
They are intended to build bridges between the various forms of employment and, for example, enable unemployed people to be employed while employees undergo further training
Incentives for employers, such as induction grants, would be practically cost-neutral for the Federal Agency, as they are based on the reallocation of passive funds to active funds
In view of the large differences in income, the effective implementation of a reduction in working hours for the lower and middle wage groups can only be achieved through financial compensation
Against this backdrop, we welcome the trade unions' initiatives for differentiated wage compensation for the lower and middle income groups
In addition to collective bargaining efforts, public compensation offers must be introduced
These include the increase in the minimum taxable income and child benefit provided for under the green income tax reform
Differentiated models of temporary part-time benefits and partial unemployment benefits are to be financed from the funds of the Federal Employment Agency
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN also advocate an individual increase in pension entitlements
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to use financial incentives to encourage companies to reduce working hours
The green bonus-malus model creates incentives to reduce working hours by differentiating employers' social security contributions according to working hours
We want to redistribute the revenue from employers' contributions in such a way that companies that spread the total amount of working time over many employees are relieved of this burden
Companies that offer few part-time jobs, on the other hand, are to be burdened
Reform and expansion of labor promotion policy
Active job promotion is essential to effectively combat mass unemployment
Alliance 90/The Greens focus on preventive and active labor market policy - instead of simply financing unemployment
By shifting from passive to active benefits, we want to focus on securing and increasing employment
At least half of the funds of the Federal Labor Office must be available for active promotion policy
These funds must be used in coordination with the employment promotion measures of the federal states, municipalities, employers and sponsors
and incentives are created to mobilize additional funds
Employment promotion must not undermine the collectively agreed regulations of the primary labor market
Below-tariff pay must not be a condition for promotion
and a contract design that violates or undermines collective bargaining standards customary in the industry may not be rewarded with employment promotion funds
Overall, the instruments of employment promotion policy must be used in a more targeted manner
Groups that have particular problems on the labor market - the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, the low-skilled, young people without school-leaving qualifications and foreigners - must be integrated and given special support
One model for this are the so-called "social" companies
With their objective of creating socially meaningful and at the same time economically profitable jobs, they do not limit themselves to "additional" and charitable activities
Instead, they offer marketable goods and services in order to generate as much of their costs as possible themselves
By increasing the compensatory levy for unfilled compulsory jobs for severely disabled persons, the incentive to hire severely disabled employees is to be increased
After 15 years of steadily rising unemployment figures, it is obvious that many people, especially the long-term unemployed, will not be able to find a job in the foreseeable future through market forces alone
We therefore advocate the long-term establishment of an additional publicly funded employment sector
This also allows new tasks to be developed between the market and the public sector
At the same time, Alliance 90/The Greens want to dissolve the rigid boundaries between the "first" and "second" labor market
The task of active labor market policy is to build bridges to regular employment relationships
Continuing education and training are particularly important
Transparency and a targeted focus on economic needs form the basis for this
Traditional educational institutions should be more closely involved in this process
More employment opportunities for young women
and men - actively combating youth unemployment
The special situation of young people must be taken into account in all labor market policy measures
To ensure that young people have the right to a training place, we are calling for pay-as-you-go financing
Labor market policies that focus on young people must also take into account the strengthening of self-determination rights of young employees and trainees
Unemployed young people must have the right to integration into the labor market.
and qualification measures after six months at the latest
In the long term, it must be ensured that trainees are employed in the profession they have learned for at least one year
Socially insure any permanent employment
More and more people are forced to work as bogus self-employed or marginal part-time workers without social security protection, in some cases without any prospect of a living
wage These precarious patterns of employment and occupation must be protected under labor and social security law, and
financial and tax discrimination must be dismantled
All permanent employment must be covered by social security
Dovetailing labor market and structural policy
In view of the employment situation in eastern Germany and other structurally weak regions in particular, new paths must be taken in labor policy
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN have presented a concept: Part of the wage subsidies from the Federal Employment Agency should be integrated into regional structural policy and linked to the implementation of investments
The subsidized companies are obliged to provide subsequent employment
Women are to be promoted equally
Alliance 90/The Greens also want to support business start-ups from unemployment and promote the linking of labor market policy with the non-profit sector
Starting a business out of unemployment must not lead to a new type of unprotected employment relationship
In general, labor market policy instruments should be geared more towards regional development concepts in order to strengthen regional potentials
The aim is to bundle the various activities and financial resources into a regional promotion program from a single source
For a European employment policy
The internationalization of markets relativizes the scope of national employment policy
Alliance 90/The Greens therefore advocate greater coordination of national employment policies
In order to effectively combat unemployment in Europe, we are calling on the European Council to adopt a "European Pact for Employment, Solidarity and Ecology" with binding obligations for the Member States
We are focusing primarily on joint steps to harmonize the reduction in working hours
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate a European investment fund to finance job-creating infrastructure projects and create new jobs
Decentralized networks in particular should be promoted: the expansion of rail in regional transport, renewable energies, non-commercial and public service offerings in multimedia and information networks, environmental protection, urban renewal and the expansion of services in the social and cultural sectors
Existing funds must be restructured and made more effective according to these criteria
EU funding policy is intended to promote sustainability,
Employment and
Promoting equality for women
The creation of new jobs must have priority in the allocation of EU structural funding
An "eco-audit" that guarantees sustainability is essential
At least one third of resources for structural support should be committed to local development and local employment
Financing labor market policy
is a task for society as a whole
In 1997, the economic costs of unemployment amounted to about 180 billion| DM The
financing of labor market policy cannot be shifted unilaterally onto the contributors to the social insurance
systems Therefore, in addition to the inclusion of everyone in the social systems, a considerable part must be financed from tax revenues
The Green eco-tax concept provides funds for the reduction of
unemployment insurance Extending the tax financing of labor market policy does not call into question the insurance character of unemployment insurance
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN adhere to the principles of contribution financing, of shared contributions and solidarity-based redistribution within the unemployment insurance system
To finance active labor market policies, an earmarked federal subsidy is to be introduced into the unemployment insurance system, focusing on active measures
Shaping fair competition -
Limit economic power
Productive assets are distributed one-sidedly in the Federal Republic of Germany
A small minority determines how and what is produced
This concentration of economic power leads to the distortion of many market processes and impairs the democratic equality of political participation for all
Alliance 90/The Greens want to reform the Act against Restraints of Competition
and tighten merger control
Monopoly structures must be dissolved,
Economic power restricted
and small and medium-sized enterprises are protected
Fair competition also benefits consumers who would otherwise have to pay inflated prices for a lower supply
Their local supply would also be severely disrupted
Alliance 90/The Greens want to establish a new competition regime, particularly for new media, the energy industry, banks, trade and tourism
Alliance 90/The Greens want to make it easier for suppliers of environmentally friendly energy to enter the market
A reform of energy industry law must break up the dominant market position of the electricity companies
All energy providers must have the opportunity to use the grid
We therefore advocate the separation of ownership of energy generation, transportation and distribution
In addition, an electricity feed-in law is needed to improve the market opportunities for suppliers of wind and solar power
Alliance 90/The Greens want to reform company law, which concentrates economic power unilaterally in the banks and promotes the close links between banks and big business
The control function of supervisory boards and the capital market must be strengthened
Large banks and a few insurance groups have gained great influence over many companies
This is why Alliance 90/The Greens are calling for a limitation and disclosure of shareholdings,
? a limit on the number of Supervisory Board mandates,
? the abolition of the right to vote on deposited shares without instructions
At the same time, competition in the financial sector must be strengthened
It is particularly important to establish a functioning private venture capital market in order to improve the financing conditions, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as providers of innovation and jobs
We demand that banks move away from their rigid focus on security and give more credit to human abilities and skills through a willingness to provide risk capital
Small and medium-sized banks in particular are hindered by a flood of bureaucracy and overregulation
We therefore want to reform the Banking Act and the practice of banking supervision
Alliance 90/The Greens want employees to participate in productive assets
We will develop a concept for this in the next legislative period that will present the various positive aspects
More democracy in business
Alliance 90/The Greens want to strengthen the co-decision options of dependent employees
and provide employees in companies with more protection against wrong business decisions
More protection results from more co-determination
In smaller companies, however, more co-determination also means taking on more responsibility for the development of the company
A reform of the Works Constitution Act is intended to give employees and their works councils an extended right to information and participation
Alliance 90/The Greens want to regulate co-determination in small and medium-sized companies more clearly
In doing so, we want to expand the scope for employees and companies to represent and balance the interests of smaller companies
By promoting appropriate advisory services, companies and employees are to be given more help in their search for potential solutions to conflicts within the company
By redefining the concept of a company, micro-entrepreneurs and freelancers are to be granted employee rights to ensure their social security
The role of works councils in large or international companies must be redefined with regard to the introduction of genuine co-determination rights
Employees' interests must be given the same importance as shareholders' interests in corporations so that job security becomes part of corporate policy
However, companies are increasingly breaking the law by not adhering to collective bargaining regulations and pressuring works councils to conclude company agreements that do not comply with collective agreements
Instead of legalizing this breach of the law by amending the Works Constitution Act, Alliance 90/The Greens are calling for a right of action for trade unions to enforce collective agreements
Alliance 90/The Greens demand the deletion without replacement of § 116 AFG, which drastically restricts the trade unions' ability to strike
Our aim is to give representatives of consumer and environmental associations seats on the supervisory boards of large corporations
Collective bargaining autonomy is an important element of democratic co-determination
Alliance 90/The Greens support the efforts to preserve the sectoral collective agreement as an essential element of a solidary wage policy and to make it future-proof
The development of self-managed and cooperative enterprises must be encouraged and a suitable legal form created
Promote start-ups
Strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises
Alliance 90/The Greens want to comprehensively reform the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups
We want to compensate for the competitive disadvantages of these company sizes
and improve the promotion of qualifications
The compensation of disadvantages for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises is to be achieved with public funding programs, among other things
Instead of new funding programs for SMEs and start-ups, Alliance 90/The Greens want to reorganize the almost 400 funding programs into a few basic programs
The programs should focus on product and process innovations, market introduction, qualification, consulting and guarantees
The equity base of small and medium-sized enterprises is to be strengthened by establishing a functioning venture capital market as an alternative to the banking system
A supra-regional information exchange, where potential venture capital providers and investors are brought together, is a first step
In the medium to long term, equity financing is to replace loan reductions
Women who want to set up their own business are a special target group for green business start-up policy
Women often have less equity and less experience in management positions
While a woman often backs up a business founder, many women also do housework and family work alongside their self-employment
Business start-up support must take this specific situation of women into account
In particular, the funding programs should also enable start-ups with low investment volumes in the social and service sectors
No new hurdles should be created for start-ups
The obligation to be a master craftsman must not be extended
The Crafts Code must be reformed
In principle, it must be possible to complete the master craftsman's certificate while working, even after setting up a business
The admission requirements for the master craftsman's examination must be extended to include lateral entrants from other professions
In addition, the content of the master craftsman examination must be adapted to the changing requirements of a highly qualified, service-oriented craft business
Developing regional potential
The Federal Government's economic policy is unilaterally geared towards promoting exports
As important as exports are for a highly industrialized country like Germany, it should not be forgotten that around two thirds of the national product is sold domestically
It is also forgotten that long-distance transportation is associated with losses in quality (e.g. loss of freshness in food) and environmental compatibility (due to long-distance road transport)
Alliance 90/The Greens want to focus more on the strengths and capabilities of regions
This particularly includes agriculture and local trades, which are playing a growing role in employment policy in Germany
Direct marketing of organically produced products,
Promoting the regional networking of tourism, crafts, agriculture and services can strengthen the economic power of structurally weak regions
We are committed to strengthening regional economic cycles
Regionalized financial flows also contribute to a stable regional economic structure
Savings banks in particular, with their focus on promoting the regional economy and their commitment to the common good, can be interesting partners in a socio-ecological transformation
We therefore want to secure the existence and development of this sector
We want to abandon the sole focus of regional development policy on the criterion of exports
The regions themselves are to formulate the guiding principles for a desirable economic structure in regional, democratically legitimized development concepts, which will form the basis for the allocation of funds
Women's interests must be given equal consideration both in the analysis and in the guiding principles and projects of the regional development concepts
In this way, we want to focus funding more on creating jobs and meeting regional needs
Reconstruction East needs staying power -
making the east fit for the future
Unemployment in eastern Germany is still twice as high as the German average and the eastern German economy is a long way from a self-sustaining upturn
The Kohl government relied on outdated concepts for the reconstruction of the East instead of sustainability
It has criminally squandered the unique opportunity to combine the reconstruction of an entire economy with setting the course for sustainable economic activity
Steering towards the future -
Distribute superstructure loads fairly
A change of direction is needed in the promotion of infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector
While freeway routes are currently being carved through the country at huge expense, hundreds of millions are being spent on technical upgrades for minimally used airports and billions are being spent on a superfluous Transrapid line, the sensible expansion of rail routes is being delayed or not carried out at all, the railroads are being dismantled in the area and local public transport is being kept on a tight leash
Alliance 90/The Greens want to create efficient long-distance transport links (e.g. Lübeck-Stralsund, Central German Railway), maintain the regional railroad and complete it by closing gaps, and
Develop public transport into a real alternative to private motorized transport by promoting modernization and densification
Furthermore, funds must be made available for the ecological remediation of industrial and military contaminated sites
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to create the necessary conditions for a careful, cost-conscious and environmentally friendly redevelopment of inner cities by means of loans for development areas and an increased commitment of the federal government to urban development promotion
Against the background of these major tasks and the divided economic development in East and West, the reduction of the solidarity surcharge - the only contribution that civil servants and the self-employed also pay - is anti-social clientelism
Alliance 90/The Greens propose an ecological structural support program for the east as a joint task of the federal, state and local governments
The financing of this program must not be at the expense of employees
We therefore want - for a limited period - a levy of up to 2.5% on assets in excess of DM 2 million.
Partnership relations
to Central and Eastern Europe
Support for democratic developments in Central and Eastern Europe and the eastward expansion of the EU can also benefit the east German economy if the opportunity for development in partnership is seized
East German states, municipalities and economic partners bear a special responsibility in the task of reducing fears and prejudices and developing socially and environmentally compatible concepts for low-conflict integration of the new EU members and partners because of their geographical proximity and their shared experience of system change, The
Alliance 90/The Greens therefore want to advocate fair accession conditions and the further development of joint support concepts with the neighboring countries of the Czech Republic and Poland
Existing European regions and new ones to be created serve to promote understanding and regional development in partnership across linguistic and administrative borders
State duties equitably,
solid and transparent financing
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to end the chaos in budgetary and financial policy
Our guidelines are justice, predictability and solidity
Our main goals are the ecological orientation of economic activity, the
safeguarding and creation of jobs
and the reduction of social injustice
Prerequisites for this are:? the disclosure of the state's financial situation and a reform of budget management,
? the stabilization of revenues,
? a halt to the tax-cutting race in Europe, ? the
fair distribution of the financing of public spending, ?
the ongoing review of government spending, ? the
restoration of the financial capacity to act of the states and local authorities
Save and design
The high interest burden caused by rising debt limits the future government's ability to act and makes reform policies more difficult
However, reform policy is necessary
We need a cash audit
This includes a critical review of the program's spending projects
After that, Alliance 90/The Greens will redefine the priorities
We will also tackle reforms that cost money, such as an active employment policy,
Investment in the education system,
basic social security,
increasing funding for international cooperation
and greater tax financing of social insurance (instead of taxes on labor)
Savings must be made - key areas of savings are: ? the military budget (Eurofighter, landmines, reduction in personnel),
? economically nonsensical projects in the transport sector such as the Transrapid and the construction of further highways,
? Funding for nuclear research, genetic engineering and other high-risk technologies,
? nonsensical subsidies for individual sectors (e|g| hard coal)
and for a misguided agricultural policy,
? excessive expenses for the Berlin move and
? the intelligence services
A central area of green reform policy is also the state administration itself
We want to develop new concepts for government action in all areas of the state together with public sector employees and not against them
With less bureaucracy, better government services can be offered to citizens in many cases
Quality assurance, cost transparency, proximity to citizens and decentralization are the guiding principles of green administrative reform
Limit deficits and reduce debt
ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS reject a policy of growing debt
Debt limitation and debt reduction are necessary - but not a dogma
A policy that rules out any new debt exacerbates the economic crisis
If important ecological and social tasks (e|B|cleanup of contaminated sites or education) are only tackled half-heartedly or not at all, this can cost society all the more in the long run
Those who save without investing are destroying the state
As a guideline, we are striving for a medium-term consolidation program
Budget policy must be aligned with the principle of sustainability On
this basis, new borrowing must be reduced
Reorganization of financial relations
Financial relations between the federal, state and local authorities have become unbalanced in recent years
While the federal government decides on most taxes, the state administrations are responsible for collecting them
However, the fiscal equalization system is designed in such a way that the federal states have little interest in strict tax collection and instead engage in indirect economic promotion
This is another reason why tax revenues are falling
The federal government has shifted tasks to lower levels without ensuring cost equalization
Added to this is the growing importance of the European Union in financial matters
Alliance 90/The Greens are calling for a reorganization of federal financial relations together with the federal states and municipal umbrella organizations, whereby municipalities and the new federal states must not be disadvantaged compared to the current regulations
A reform of the fiscal equalization system must make it attractive for both recipient and donor countries to generate additional revenue and operate economically
However, we clearly reject any attempt to misuse the necessary reform of financial relations for regional chauvinistic maneuvers, as some Union Minister Presidents in particular are doing
We reject the attempt by the payer states, in particular Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, to improve their position by reducing their own contributions to the federal state financial equalization scheme at the expense of the reconstruction of the eastern states in a lack of solidarity
Strengthening the backs of the municipalities
Article 28 (2) of the Basic Law reads: "The municipalities must be guaranteed the right to regulate all matters of the local community within the framework of the law on their own responsibility"
But the reality is far removed from this claim
Local authority budgets illustrate the impending collapse of local self-government
The scope for action has been drastically reduced in recent years and the implementation of municipal tasks is often no longer guaranteed
If the financial situation of the municipalities is not fundamentally improved, social and cultural projects, youth welfare measures, municipal employment promotion, a social housing policy, building maintenance, energy-saving measures, public transport funding and much more will fall by the wayside
Alliance 90/The Greens call for a structural improvement in municipal finances that strengthens financial autonomy and at the same time guarantees the quantitative financial resources of the districts and municipalities
This includes strengthening the right to largely own tax revenue and the application of assessment rates
The EU Competition Act must also not further restrict the ability of municipalities to act
A fundamental reform of municipal finances must include the following elements: ? The introduction of basic security as a social safety net against poverty, also to avert social welfare burdens for the municipalities
As long as social assistance exists in its current form, the federal government must make an appropriate contribution to its financing
? If federal or state laws oblige local authorities to provide services, the necessary financial resources must also be made available for this purpose
One key reform option must be to safeguard and revitalize the trade tax
This includes a significant reduction in the tax-free allowances and an extension of trade tax to all companies within the meaning of VAT law, i.e. the inclusion of the liberal professions (medical practices, lawyers, architects, etc., who are de facto traders)
? There is also a need for reform in income tax distribution
This is particularly evident in the urban-rural divide ("bacon belt syndrome") in metropolitan areas and in the city states
Stabilize and distribute revenues fairly
Public poverty contrasts with immense private wealth: private financial assets are estimated at over DM 5|000 billion
While the burden of wage tax and social security contributions has risen steadily in recent years, recipients of income from entrepreneurial activity and assets have been systematically relieved
The situation of public budgets can only be improved in the long term if the earning power of the tax system is restored
If everyone pays, many pay less:
Income tax reform
The federal government's "major tax reform" was a flop
Only a half-hearted reduction of tax concessions, even more profit for high earners and a net relief lie of DM 40 billion - that was the concept of the Federal Government
We rightly prevented this "reform" together with the SPD in the Bundesrat
The need for a major tax reform remains on the agenda
Alliance 90/The Greens are the only opposition party to have presented a comprehensive concept for a fair, affordable and transparent reform
The social imbalance caused by the Kohl government must be corrected: Instead of more and more tax relief for high incomes and assets, small to medium incomes must finally be given tax relief
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want:? the radical reduction of tax concessions - all income should be treated equally;
? tax exemption of the minimum subsistence level - the basic allowance in income tax is increased to DM 15,000/year;
? reduce the tax rates: the initial tax rate is to be 18.5% and the top tax rate 45% from a taxable income of DM 120,000/year;
? Exempt taxpayers' expenses for risk provision (social security contributions, private old-age and health provision, etc.) up to the maximum contribution amount of the statutory social insurance (currently around DM 2| 500/month);
? simplify tax law - instead of six tax brackets, we will only need two in future;
? increase child benefit to a uniform DM 300 per month and child;
? abolish the splitting of income between spouses
This would generate a total of around DM 100 billion in additional revenue
Given the current situation of public budgets, the income tax reform must remain revenue-neutral
This means that there will be no VAT increase or spending cuts to finance it
Fairness is possible: the broadening of the tax base that we are proposing and the elimination of tax concessions and exemptions will prevent income millionaires in Germany from not having to pay a penny of tax in future
The profiteers of tax loopholes will be asked to pay
The reduction in tax rates nevertheless means an improvement in economic conditions in Germany, making it less attractive for companies to relocate to tax havens
More jobs and less shadow economy are the result
Reform of wealth taxation
Alliance 90/The Greens want to achieve greater distributive justice with a reform of inheritance and gift tax: Assets that are bequeathed or gifted should be taxed according to their actual capitalized value
Unmarried couples must no longer be at a disadvantage compared to married couples when it comes to tax assessment
Higher allowances ensure that smaller private assets are not taxed
The tax-free allowance for business assets will be doubled so that small businesses in particular are not forced to give up their business as a result of inheritance and gift tax being levied
Alliance 90/The Greens want to reintroduce the wealth tax of one percent
Assets up to DM 400|000 to remain tax-free
Load balancing
As part of an equalization of burdens, we want to levy taxes on assets over DM 2 million (after deduction of private assets) at a progressive rate of up to 2.5% - for a limited period of 15 years - as a contribution to financing German unity.
European economic policy as a pacemaker for an ecological-solidarity-based global economic order
Two thirds of Germany's imports and exports are handled with the countries of the European Union (EU)
A European single currency would help to facilitate the movement of goods and capital in Europe
Alliance 90/The Greens support the introduction of the euro on the planned date
However, we believe that further measures are necessary in order to shape a socio-ecological economic policy for Europe:
? European regulations to better capture and tax capital income, eliminate distortions of competition in corporate taxation and close tax havens in the EU;
? social and ecological framework conditions: We want to use the European Social Charter to prevent location dumping within Europe
In addition, all European states are to commit to defined targets for transboundary environmental pollution;
? an independent European antitrust authority;
? a European Monetary System (EMS) for the Member States not yet participating in monetary union, in which exchange rates are adjusted at an early stage and central banks are obliged to intervene mutually
The EMS is to be extended to Central and Eastern European countries in the future;
? a reform of the entire funding policy
- including a drastic reduction in agricultural subsidies
Control financial markets
The international financial markets are developing into a global economic risk
The sum of USD 1.3 trillion traded daily in foreign exchange transactions is offset by real transactions in goods and services in only two percent of cases
Speculative operations on the international financial markets are increasingly taking the place of potential investments and thus impairing real economic development
This piles up risks that are largely not backed by sufficient collateral
Negative setbacks for the global economy are becoming increasingly likely
At the same time, many owners of financial assets are shirking their obligations to the community
Paying taxes thus becomes a voluntary donation for speculators
To reduce speculation, Alliance 90/The Greens want to levy a turnover tax on foreign exchange transactions (Tobin tax)
The EU has a key role to play in enforcing such a regulation in the OECD and ultimately worldwide
This hardly affects long-term investments; however, speculation with minimal yield differences is no longer worthwhile
At the International Monetary Fund, the early warning system for international financial crises must be further improved by providing public information at an early stage.
and minimum standards for capital investments are developed (reporting obligations, minimum reserve regulations, proof of liquidity)
Re-founding solidarity
For a just and sustainable society
The willingness to reestablish and promote solidarity will determine the future viability of our society
The Green response to the social changes of recent decades is a reorientation of social policy towards self-determination, justice and sustainability
This is because structural change in the world of work, increasing internationalization and the breakdown of traditional family ties have changed the framework conditions for a fair distribution of opportunities and social security
After 16 years of Kohl, the welfare state in Germany is now at a turning point: in order to defend it, it must be restructured in such a way that it can cope with growing demands
The Kohl government used social upheaval, mass unemployment and the public debt it helped to create as an argument for its policy of social coldness
It has unbalanced the financing of social insurance by unilaterally shifting tasks such as German unification and dealing with mass unemployment onto the social systems
In view of the ever-increasing contributions, many employees have lost confidence in the social security systems
The result is a social climate in which the important security and equalizing function of the welfare state is increasingly being called into question
Politics and society must create a climate in which the focus is not on unbridled competition, but on mutual recognition and help
With our guiding ideas and concepts for the renewal of the welfare state, we want to enter into dialog with our alliance partners in trade unions, welfare associations, churches and independent organizations
It is important to recognize and involve those who are involved in social work on a full-time and voluntary basis
Solidarity-based restructuring of the welfare state
The welfare state needs fundamental structural reforms The
basic principles of our social policy are a stronger orientation toward need,
the inclusion of everyone in the solidarity systems,
Improving the revenue situation of social insurance schemes through increased tax subsidies and the gradual abolition of contribution assessment limits
and the demand for solidarity from the economically better off
The security systems must be designed and financed in such a way that social security is also made possible for future generations as a basic component of social coexistence
Alliance 90/The Greens include the far-reaching change in the world of work toward flexible employment patterns as a basic element in their social policy concepts
Alliance 90/The Greens want to create a social safety net that covers the risks of being temporarily or permanently unable to earn a living
The relationship between phases of gainful employment and phases of other employment must be flexible and interlocked
Only a modern social policy that succeeds in this can do justice to its task of guaranteeing social security and fair opportunities for all in interaction with labor market policy
The introduction of basic social security and a binding social infrastructure that is geared towards the needs of those affected and planning security are our social policy reform priorities
This includes an active policy in favor of people with children and a sustainable old-age provision
We stand for a solidarity-based and efficient health care system
as well as for a reorientation in housing policy
Women's life plans as a benchmark
The last decades have led to positive changes in the living situations of women in both parts of Germany
Alliance 90/The Greens have advocated these changes as important steps toward emancipation
Nevertheless, women remain disadvantaged in many areas
Even more: in the eastern part of the republic, German unification means a step backward for women - they are particularly affected by mass unemployment
Our social policy includes the specific situation of women as a basic element: We want to reform the social security systems in such a way that they are oriented toward women's life and work histories In
particular, this concerns a much improved recognition of child-rearing and care work
Because women still take on the largest share of these important activities
Self-determination
Solidarity-based policy is more than mere welfare
The possibility and empowerment of the individual for self-determination is one of the guiding principles of Green policy
This applies to all social groups, including the supposedly weak
We demand that children and young people be recognized as independent personalities
Equal rights and equality for the disabled and those in need of care are a matter of course for us Disability
and the need for care must not be allowed to continue to lead to people being curtailed in their self-determined way of life,
Foreigners living in Germany must not be discriminated against in social policy
Refugees must not receive less assistance for their livelihood than needy Germans.
Strengthen social infrastructure
A central element of active social policy is to ensure a diverse social infrastructure
Counseling centers, youth centers, leisure and care services are important building blocks for opening up self-determination and mutual support It is
precisely in this area that a wealth of self-initiatives and self-responsible providers has emerged
Strengthening and supporting them is an integral part of Green social policy
So that local authorities can also better perform their own tasks in these areas, inparticular, their financial leeway must be strengthened within the framework of a new financial equalization of the state levels
The possibilities for action of local self-help initiatives, which charge for services and goods according to the principle of reciprocity (e.g. barter rings), should be improved
A social network against poverty:
the means-tested basic income support
Alliance 90/The Greens want to put the social safety net against poverty on a new footing
Subsistence assistance, unemployment assistance and benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act are to be replaced by a means-tested basic income support scheme
The existing social welfare system has long ceased to provide effective protection against poverty because its benefits have not kept pace with rising costs
With our basic income support, we want to cover the minimum socio-cultural needs of all those who do not have sufficient income or assets and who live in Germany, regardless of their nationality and residence status
The existing assistance in special circumstances remains in place, e.g. in the event of disability, need for care or loss of housing
We want to prevent recipients from being exposed to official arbitrariness by means of a consistent flat-rate system instead of countless individual applications
Transparency, the simplification of means testing and improved procedural rules ensure legal certainty and also simplify administrative processes
New services and new rights
Our basic security model provides for a general lump sum and a lump sum for warm housing costs
If several people live together, they should all have an individual entitlement to basic income support in equal shares
The lump sums are regularly adjusted to the increased cost of living
In addition, health and long-term care insurance contributions and, in the case of unemployed recipients, unemployment insurance contributions are covered
Older people and the disabled receive additional needs supplements
The basic income support level must correspond to the standard financial requirement for leading a decent life, which also includes the necessary costs of participation in social, cultural and political life as well as scope for independent economic activity
For the introduction, the general lump sum for single persons is therefore DM 800, with an additional DM 560 for each additional person
A commission of experts, including representatives of the organizations concerned, will then promptly draw up recommendations for a needs assessment system and the level of basic income support
The benchmark for a living income should not be the reference to lower wage groups, but the actual need
The proposed level of requirements can lead to basic security benefits for a family of several people that are higher than the low earned income of a single-earner household
Falling real wages and an inadequate equalization of family burdens have created a class that is poor despite being gainfully employed
These people would not be served if social benefits were set at an even lower, no longer humane level by means of a "wage gap requirement"; we therefore reject this
Anyone who earns too little to secure their own or their family's livelihood receives supplementary basic income support
However, we want to relieve the burden on working people with low incomes by massively increasing the basic tax-free allowance as part of the income tax reform,
the initial tax rate was reduced
and child benefit is increased
All unemployed recipients of basic income support have the right to participate in employment promotion measures so that those registered as unemployed have the opportunity to get back on their feet
We also want to improve additional income opportunities
We reject discrimination through benefit cuts and forced labor
New maintenance regulations
For basic security, the maintenance regulations are adapted to the times
Alliance 90/The Greens therefore want to limit the obligation to pay maintenance within the framework of basic security to those who actually live together as a cohabitation
Parents are then obliged to pay maintenance to their children until they have completed their initial education
If a partner in a marriage or cohabitation claims basic security, civil law maintenance claims are transferred to the basic security provider
Fewer visits to authorities
For the administration of basic benefits, we want to introduce the principle of providing benefits from a single source
This means that, for example, if someone is unemployed, the basic benefits will be paid out by the employment office and that if the pension insurance institution's pension entitlements are insufficient, the pension will be topped up to the basic benefits level from tax revenues
This saves administrative procedures for those affected
Funding
We want the federal government to contribute to the financing of basic security and to relieve the financial burden on the municipalities
We want to raise the additional costs of DM 12 billion compared to previous expenditures by reforming the inheritance tax and reintroducing a wealth tax
Re-establishing solidarity between the generations
Relieve families
In our society, life with children tends to be made more difficult than it is encouraged.
Alliance 90/The Greens are committed to a framework that enables mothers and fathers, and especially single parents, to continue to participate in society, e|b|through gainful employment, if they personally decide to have children,
As part of our income tax concept, we initially want to introduce a uniform child allowance of DM 300 per child
and improve childcare options
We also want to improve the crediting of individual childcare costs in tax law
In addition to the legal entitlement to a place in a kindergarten, a wide range of childcare options must also be available for children under the age of three and schoolchildren, whereby the municipalities must be given financial leeway for this
Within the framework of basic welfare provision, significantly higher entitlements for children are envisaged In order
for family and career to be compatible, parents must be able to react more flexibly to the needs of their children and the demands of work and society
We want to replace the completely inadequate parental leave with the right to a time account of three years, coupled with the right to return to work The
possibility of reducing weekly working hours to care for children is also to be enshrined in law
Subsistence benefits while taking "parental leave" are to be significantly higher than the current parental allowance, and income limits are to be raised
Strengthening the rights of children and young people
The number of children and young people growing up in poverty is increasing every year
Their life chances for the future are significantly impaired
For us, one of the most important tasks is to expand the rights of children and young people
This includes independent entitlements to basic security and
the orientation of maintenance claims to the needs of children and young people
We want the law to make it clear and unambiguous that children are to be raised without violence There
must be no right to beat children It is
It is important that children can live in an environment in which they do not have to be afraid of sexualized violence and abuse by trusted persons
view of the many different family forms in which children and adolescents grow up, we want to anchor the right to contact with people who are important to them, regardless of the degree of kinship The
same applies to foster care and adoption options, which must take much greater account of the principle of social parenthood
In the Child and Youth Welfare Act, we want to defend standards that correspond to the situation in life
The qualitative standards of the KJHG for youth welfare and participation are to be maintained and anchored in a legally binding manner
Livelihood security in old age for all
For Alliance 90/The Greens, guaranteeing solidarity-based retirement provision - and in particular protection against poverty in old age - is one of the key tasks
Statutory pension insurance and the intergenerational contract are out of balance
The reason for this is the overburdening of the financing of tasks for society as a whole and the fact that fewer and fewer contributors are facing more and more pensioners
At the same time, many pensions, especially for women, are already insufficient to live on
On the other hand, the younger generation cannot be expected to pay increasing contributions for today's pensioners if it is questionable whether pension entitlements can be realized at all later on
We therefore want to comprehensively reform the pension system,
Securing an independent pension for women
and redistribute the burden between the generations
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN are committed to a pension scheme financed on the basis of solidarity
The primary goal is to provide a pension that covers everyone's livelihood
The current considerable differentiation in pension levels must be reduced by introducing minimum security elements to effectively prevent poverty in old age
A reformed pension system also requires an increased share of financing from tax revenues so as not to burden contributors with the inclusion of important new elements
Self-employed persons, members of parliament, marginally employed persons and civil servants must also be included in a solidary pension scheme and the preservation of the intergenerational contract
Take into account new life and work histories -.
Introduce minimum security elements
A key point of the green pension reform is the introduction of flat-rate contribution periods
The significantly improved recognition of periods of education and further training, interruptions in employment and the full recognition of child-raising periods mean that the pension system is based on realistic life and employment histories
Low pension contributions due to part-time employment are topped up, particularly "bad" insurance years are excluded
These changes have a particular impact on women, who thus acquire (higher) independent pension entitlements
If your own pension entitlements are not sufficient, your pension will be topped up from tax revenue by introducing a minimum basic level equivalent to basic income support
Overall, our proposals aim to systematically improve the situation of people with low incomes and unstable employment histories
To safeguard the individual standard of living, the statutory pension insurance scheme is to be expanded in such a way as to facilitate higher and continued insurance cover
We will significantly improve the conditions for company pension schemes
It must also be geared to unsteady employment histories, set lower conditions for entitlement to benefits and facilitate the possibility of transferring entitlements
New scope must be created for small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to make appropriate offers to their employees
New financing shares
The financing of pensions must meet demographic and financial requirements
We want to finance old-age security for all through increased subsidies from tax revenue and through reallocations within the system In
concrete terms, this means that high pensions must gradually decrease in proportion to be able to finance the increase in low pensions
In order to relieve the burden on contributors and to take account of the requirements of the labor market, the increase in the subsidy will be financed from tax revenue from the proceeds of the ecological tax reform
A demographic factor in the pension formula is to take account of increased life expectancy
Alliance 90/The Greens maintain solidarity-based coverage of the risk of disability
Securing social network through value-added component
With the volume of employment no longer rising, but rather the demands on the social security system increasing, it can no longer be based solely on gainful employment
Additional subsidies from tax revenue (eco-tax) must be added, as well as partial financing in the medium term via company value added
In the next legislative period, the Greens want to prepare a reform that will replace the employer's social security contribution with a value-added tax in the medium term
would relieve the burden on employment-intensive companies (e.g., small businesses and craft enterprises), while capital- and technology-intensive companies would be more strongly integrated into the social responsibility system The
value-added tax would, however, have to be designed in such a way that it does not act as a brake on investment and modernization
Self-determined instead of excluded
A democratic and emancipatory society must guarantee self-determination and comprehensive social participation (integration) for people with disabilities
People in need of care must also be able to determine their own living conditions
For our disability policy, which is based on the principle of emancipation and self-determination, the focus is not on cost arguments, but on creating framework conditions that enable those affected to lead an equal life in everyday life
We therefore want to reintroduce the legal entitlement to vocational rehabilitation for disabled young people and adults into employment promotion law
Workshops for the disabled should primarily be a place for training and learning
Integration companies in which disabled and non-disabled people work together must be promoted
Instead of relegating disabled people to homes and institutions for cost reasons, we demand the right for disabled people and those in need of care to choose the form of their care themselves
This also includes the right to enter into an employment relationship with the nursing staff (employer model)
This form of care must also be given access to care insurance benefits in kind
Disabled women and women in need of care in particular must have the right to accept only female caregivers
A separate law on benefits for the disabled must regulate entitlements to integration benefits and other assistance in a new and transparent way, taking into account the principle of meeting needs
The introduction of long-term care insurance was associated with a large number of wrong decisions
The task now is to make corrections to the most urgent points
The second stage of care insurance has radically lowered care standards in homes for the disabled and elderly
The mechanism of passing on costs to social insurance providers is unchecked
It must be improved with regard to the benefits catalog and the distinction from supplementary assistance systems
The narrow concept of care, reduced to basic physical care, must be replaced by a holistic concept of care that includes physical, psychological, educational and social aspects
The provision of care services according to standardized "modules" violates human dignity and must therefore be replaced by rules that respect the individuality and self-determination of people in need of care
People's quality of life and right to self-determination must not be classified as a "financial imposition"
In the long term, funds should be concentrated on those who need them by introducing a needs test
For a humane health policy
The "health reform" pursued by the federal government breaks core elements from the solidary statutory health insurance (GKV) and burdens the sick and the old with fees, co-payments and deductibles
As a result, comprehensive health care now exists only for those The
talk of "cost containment" conceals the withdrawal from the solidarity system and the massive servicing of the interests of certain providers and the pharmaceutical industry
Alliance 90/The Greens oppose this with a solidarity-based health policy reform program that emphasizes equality and participation and promotes the health of all groups of the population
We are thus striving for the ideal of health as a state of physical, mental and social well-being, as defined by the World Health Organization
For a healthy living and working environment
Health is more than the absence of illness
Health policy affects all areas of life
Environmental pollution, health risks at the workplace, psychosocial stress and discrimination are disease triggers that are difficult to influence individually
This must be reflected in an overall policy that benefits the health of all people
Prevention in this area is therefore a political task for society
New priorities must be set in medical research, particularly with regard to health protection in the workplace and in environmental medicine
We want the promotion of health to become the guiding principle of health policy
It must precede curative, rehabilitative and nursing measures and address the conditions that cause the disease
The dead-end path of high-tech medicine is reinforced by the use of genetic engineering
Far overestimated in its potential, it has a limited benefit in individual cases with some drugs and diagnostics
The risks must be countered as far as possible by the greatest possible transparency and control of research, accompanying risk research and a tightening of liability law
We want a redistribution of public research funds to also promote and develop alternative healing methods
We reject as dishonest and irresponsible the raising of unfulfillable hopes of curing seriously ill people
Alliance 90/The Greens continue to reject genetic engineering in medicine in principle
However, we respect the use of genetic engineering in medicines, diagnostics and basic research if current medicine offers no alternative to those affected
We strongly oppose the plans to establish property rights and exploitation monopolies over genes and parts of the human body via an EU patent directive
The image of humanity associated with genetic engineering jeopardizes human dignity and the right to physical integrity
We reject the Council of Europe's Bioethics Convention and the UNESCO Declaration
For a democratic and solidarity-based healthcare system
Alliance 90/The Greens want a democratic healthcare system
This means comprehensive involvement of the insured and an expansion of patient rights and protection
Self-help movement and organization must be strengthened
Solidarity-based cover for all risks in the event of illness is a cornerstone of the welfare state
The financing of the SHI system must be restored in equal shares by employees and employers
Additional payments are due
The statutory health insurance system needs a fairer and more equitable basis, e.g. in the short term by aligning the contribution assessment threshold and the compulsory insurance threshold with the level of pension insurance and in the long term by including civil servants and the self-employed in the solidarity-based insurance system
A standardized supply is a basic element of social security
Regionalization of health-related planning is necessary in order to do justice to the special features of the regions
Healthcare must be measured against strict quality criteria that are subject to democratic control
This serves to protect patients, prevents nonsensical measures and also saves costs
For a healthcare system committed to a holistic view of humanity
Health is a holistic task
In addition to the equal participation of relatives, patient-oriented care requires cooperation between doctors, psychotherapists, nurses, social workers and other healthcare professionals
We want to strengthen the social and communication skills of those involved
Among other things, a corresponding reform of medical studies is necessary
In the event of illness, GPs must coordinate and manage further healthcare provision in consultation with the patient against the background of freedom of choice
This requires, among other things, a new fee system
Decentralized integrated care services, cooperative forms of practice and interprofessional cooperation should be promoted
The interlinking and networking of the outpatient and inpatient sectors must be promoted by maintaining and expanding polyclinical facilities and hospitals and promoting health centers to maintain and improve health care.
The federal states are responsible for planning and financing hospitals
Spa medicine combines prevention and rehabilitation in exemplary fashion
For this reason, the one-sided changes brought about by the structural health reform must be reversed in the interests of a holistic healthcare system
The special therapeutic directions are to be recognized as equivalent healing methods, provided their benefits for patients are recognizable
Criteria must be developed for remuneration by the health insurance funds that do justice to their diversity
Psychiatric care must be further developed as community-based social psychiatric care
The legal framework and funding conditions must be further developed in line with the psychiatric reform
For a humane drug policy
The federal government's addiction and drug policy creates problems and dangers that are far greater than the risks posed by the drugs themselves
Instead of zero tolerance and drug war, we demand harm reduction and risk minimization for drug users
The key to a turnaround in addiction and drug policy lies in health policy, which justice and interior ministers must finally give breathing space to
We call for honest and unprejudiced prevention and pragmatic drug help such as therapy, syringe exchange, an expansion of methadone and codeine treatment, spaces for risk-minimized drug use and medically controlled drug dispensing for long-term addicts
Carrying out analyses of synthetic drugs (ecstasy, etc.) is also an effective means of limiting damage and minimizing risk
Social and ecological housing and construction policy
We not only want to maintain the highest level of affordable housing and ensure sustainable rents and housing costs,
but also to strengthen neighborhoods,
improve the residential environment
and promote social and ecological development of the city and region
For Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, this is a fundamental component of social policy
Reducing the burden of housing costs - reform of housing subsidies
The increasing division of our society is reflected in the housing supply
Living space consumption by higher earners continues to rise
At the same time, the number of households that can no longer pay their housing costs is growing
Falling real incomes, unemployment and poverty lead to housing shortages
Rent increases have exceeded income growth for years
As a result of the social division of the city, entire districts are becoming socially disadvantaged neighborhoods for which the municipalities lack the means to take countermeasures
Disadvantaged households pay up to 50% of their net income for housing costs
The reform of housing benefit, which has been pending for years, is urgently needed
Reform the tenancy law
We want to simplify tenancy law and reform it so that it has a rent-reducing effect
A rent index law is to introduce uniform national rules for the preparation of rent indices
Rents may increase by a maximum of 5% per year and new contract rents may not be more than 10% above the local comparative rents
Tenants' own initiative, the right to tenant modernization with billing of costs and the right to exchange apartments are safeguarded
Safeguarding existing buildings before building new ones- New housing construction subsidies
With empty coffers, housing subsidies must focus on those who need them most In
view of the rapid expiration of social bonds of formerly publicly subsidized housing stock, securing low-rent stock for needy households is a priority Bündnis
Bündnis 90/Die Grünen advocate the provision of federal funds for the purchase of residential buildings, the securing of occupancy rights and the modernization of old buildings
Direct support for housing construction will give priority to the renovation of old buildings over new construction Support
must be linked to criteria for environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, cost- and space-saving ecological construction and for a permanent social commitment in new construction and a long-term social commitment in the renovation of old buildings
The aim is to achieve a fair housing cost burden based on income by means of a uniform rent equalization system throughout Germany
New Public Economy and Strengthening of Housing Cooperatives
Bündnis 90/ Die Grünen oppose the increasing sell-off of the housing stocks of the federal government, states, municipalities and public enterprises with a new public economy, which secures the assets and the special social character of these apartments through federal legislation and links them to efficient management
The rents of public housing are below the local comparative rents
Higher-income households pay rent compensation
Tax exemptions and special privileges in the allocation of public funds reward entrepreneurial activity within the framework of the "new public economy"
Cooperatives and independent housing providers can commit themselves by statute to implementing the "new public economy"
The establishment of new housing cooperatives is given special support and cooperative law is modernized
Reduction and reorientation of tax subsidies
As part of the tax reform, we want to abolish the multiple depreciation options in rental housing construction in order to use half of them as building allowances for more efficient, speculation-free and ecological promotion of the renewal of existing housing stock and rental housing construction and to use the other half to increase the tax-free minimum subsistence level
Rental benefits are also linked to the construction subsidies
The promotion of property ownership must be decoupled from land consumption by means of land ceilings
The urban sprawl accelerated by the owner-occupier allowance is to be prevented and building in existing buildings promoted
Stopping the undesirable developments in eastern Germany
With the fatal principle of restitution before compensation and with cost-driving special depreciation allowances, the Kohl government pursued a gigantic redistribution of wealth from East to West,
forced new construction on greenfield sites
and caused vacancies in inner cities and large housing estates
Renovation of existing housing stock and improvement of the living environment must be given the highest priority
According to the Old Debt Assistance Act, privatization should only take place to tenants, cooperatives and other neighborhood-based sponsors
The environmentally compatible renovation of housing should be promoted through construction subsidies and development area loans
For a new housing and property development culture
We advocate ecological construction and a new culture of living, i.e. Apartments and their floor plans must be oriented toward the needs of the residents and take into account changed family relationships and lifestyles
This includes, in particular, consideration of the living and working conditions of families and women as well as the elderly and the sick
The establishment of neighborhood-based sponsors, housing cooperatives and group construction projects should be supported
Only in this way can the anonymity of many living conditions be broken up
The special promotion of integrated housing must be observed
In the case of apartment sales by large companies, tenants and neighborhood-based sponsors and cooperatives should be granted a right of first refusal
Integrated urban renewal
In view of the social and structural decline of many residential areas - especially large housing estates - federal and state urban development funding should be realigned
The volume of funding should be increased and - in addition to the continuation of the redevelopment of the historic old towns in eastern Germany - made available primarily for the revitalization of socially disadvantaged urban districts and for the redevelopment and development of commercial sectors and conversion areas
The program of measures should be implemented on an interdepartmental basis so that labor market-related and constructional, social, cultural and business-oriented measures can be interlinked
Women's policy for an emancipated society
The end of modesty was announced when Green women confidently demanded the self-evident: at least half of all offices and mandates in the party for women and half of the jobs and apprenticeships that secure a livelihood
"Breaking into a man's world": the departure of green women means nothing less
Thanks to their expertise and the 50% quota, Green women also represent their parliamentary group in economic and foreign policy matters
Half of green ministries are headed by women
As a result, other parties could not avoid involving their women to a greater extent
Large companies have long boasted about their concepts for the advancement of women,
and the public sector is obliged almost everywhere by equal rights laws to actively counteract discrimination against women - as is now even required by the German constitution
We have also repeatedly drawn attention to violence in the private sphere
We have persistently worked to ensure that violence against women and children is no longer taboo
It took years of debate to finally punish marital rape in the same way as extramarital rape.
This change in criminal law also shows that parliamentary successes are also possible from the opposition benches
But in many other areas, the Kohl government is increasing the pressure on women
It wants to maintain its conservative image of the family, and in view of record unemployment, women should give up their jobs for "family breadwinners"
In the new federal states, female employment has already been pushed down to the lower western level
The child-raising allowance was a symbolic recognition of work with children, but women are obviously still expected to bear the responsibility for child-raising alone
Ms. Nolte demonstrated how little she values women's right to self-determination with her proposal to tighten § 218 once again
Despite Kohl, women today are self-confident and work as a matter of course
Young women in particular will increasingly shape diverse lifestyles in the future: Education, employment, involvement in associations and citizens' initiatives, public presence in culture and sport are more natural for women today than in the past
They are increasingly less likely to be driven into a corner by the question of "children or career" and rightly expect the state, the economy and their own partners to help both genders reconcile family and career
Alliance 90/The Greens want to implement individual protection for the diversity of today's lifestyles
This means that we want to rapidly reduce the disadvantages faced by women bringing up children or working part-time, e.g. in social insurance schemes
People who do not work around the clock for their entire lives should no longer be penalized
Men's lifestyles will also become more diverse - the "family breadwinner" will be a thing of the past because both genders will take their financial existence into their own hands
We want to ensure that women and men shape the upbringing of their children together
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN are committed to all policy areas in the interests of women
Distribute work and income fairly
Green women's policy focuses on independent living
We are interested in what it takes for women to earn an income that secures their livelihoods
We want to distribute work and income fairly: Between job holders and the unemployed, part-time and full-time employees and, of course, between men and women
A general reduction in working hours in large steps is a prerequisite for women to have equal access to gainful employment that secures their livelihood and for men to be able to take on their responsibilities in the areas of housework, employment, education and care work
This includes new regulations for more flexible working hours that take into account the needs of employees,
our demand for social security for precarious employment relationships
and improved starting conditions for female entrepreneurs
Women are particularly affected by unemployment
In eastern Germany, two out of three women are unemployed
Women's wages are up to 30 % below those of men
Women's work often does not secure an independent existence
The principle must therefore apply: Equal work - equal pay
The federal government is exacerbating the structural disadvantage of women in the labor market with the regulations of its employment promotion policy
The extent to which the government's policy is still geared towards male employment is made clear, for example, by the Employment Promotion Reform Act (AFRG): until now, periods during which women received maternity or child-raising benefits were treated as periods of employment subject to contributions
This period was regarded as entitlement to unemployment benefit, retraining, further training and pension
The AFRG now reverses this, systematically forcing women out of unemployment insurance
We stand by our position: this new regulation must be reversed
That is why we are fighting for statutory part-time work with the option to return to full-time employment
In the case of reduced working hours, we want social security entitlements to be maintained and secured even in the case of low wages
Part-time work with insufficient security or the so-called 620 DM (West) or 520 DM (East) jobs prevent women from securing an independent livelihood
As a result, many women are not entitled to a pension or are dependent on social welfare in old age
We want all permanent employees to be covered by social insurance
This also applies to employees in private households
The aim is to get them out of undeclared work and into employment with their own social insurance, where they can also gain qualifications
New framework conditions must ensure that such employment also remains affordable for the employer
The quota remains a means of distributing work fairly
According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, it is permissible, and we will stick to it, especially in the public sector
Nevertheless, we are aware that quotas can only have a limited effect, especially in times of job cuts
As part of a comprehensive administrative reform, we therefore want to make the advancement of women a key criterion
Women's policy restructuring of the welfare state
Women must not be treated as appendages of husbands when it comes to social benefits
The abolition of the splitting of income between spouses, which subsidizes marriage but not life with children or those in need of care, is long overdue
We want the abolition of tax class 5
and in addition to increasing the minimum subsistence level for tax purposes
Introduce child benefit for all instead of child allowances that favor the rich
Poverty still has a female face - poverty in old age, poverty among single parents, among families with several children
With the introduction of a means-tested basic income, we want to guarantee social security on the one hand, but on the other hand we are finally introducing the possibility of determining and disposing of the few resources available to us ourselves
From the point of view of women, the benefits of the pension system have always been questionable, as they have failed to meet the (male) norm with their CVs
We want pensions to be measured against the everyday reality of women
Periods of education and training and periods of care and child-raising should be better valued.
and low contributions, mainly as a result of part-time work, should be classified higher
Overall, this means an increase in low pension entitlements and a reduction in high pension entitlements
Taking advantage of the generational shift - promoting women and women's research
Women with a university degree often earn considerably less for the same work than their university-educated colleagues
Only a third of all doctoral scholarships and measures to promote habilitation are awarded to women
Women are only considered for 12% of early appointments
The structural changes we propose at universities are particularly beneficial to women because of their greater permeability
We want to improve access to new professorships for qualified female scientists and increase the proportion of women in the natural sciences and engineering in particular
The upcoming generational change at universities, which will make many jobs redundant, must be used proactively for this purpose
The advancement of women plays a central role in the reform of the Higher Education Framework Act that we are striving for
In future, financial allocations are to be linked to the results of the advancement of women, which must be demonstrated on a regular basis
Women should be equally represented on university committees and appointment committees
The advancement of women and women's studies are closely linked
Women's studies makes gender relations the subject of scientific work and thus makes an important contribution to reflecting on and changing social conditions
In addition to anchoring feminist science and women's studies in the study and examination regulations of all universities, the establishment of a women's university would create a further opportunity to specifically promote women and advance women's research
Upgrading health care and nursing professions
Women in particular have been committed to a different health consciousness for many years; It ismainly women who have introduced health centers and founded self-help groups
With its "austerity laws", the federal government has cancelled the solidarity-based health insurance system
The impact of the cuts is hitting women as insured persons, patients, employees and those responsible for family
health In the health care professions, it is mainly women who have to iron out the sickening results of this policy The
drastic cuts in continued payment of wages, sick pay and co-payments for medicines are particularly hard on low-income earners
The deduction of vacation days in the event of illness for working mothers often presents them with major problems, since the remaining vacation time is even less sufficient than before to cover the school vacations
Alliance 90/The Greens call for the repeal of the cutback laws,
more health care
and support for self-help groups
In the nursing professions, which are primarily women's professions, we advocate a uniform nationwide regulation of training with more qualification and promotion opportunities and greater permeability into related professions
Part of the training must be the practical implementation of the right to self-determination of persons in need of care
Determine pregnancy yourself
Alliance 90/The Greens continue to demand the deletion of the misogynistic abortion paragraph 218 from the Criminal Code
Alliance 90/The Greens are committed to comprehensive information and advice services on sexuality, contraception and pregnancy
Counseling must be voluntary and open-ended
Abortions must be possible in all federal states close to where people live and using methods that are not harmful to health
This also includes the approval of the abortion pill RU 486
The financial settlement must take place via the health insurance companies
Part of the right to self-determination is the right to decide whether and which prenatal diagnostics a pregnant woman undergoes
We are concerned that the pressure to bring children into the world "without blemish" is increasing
We are opposed to women being made "eugenically obligated"
We fight for the right to free choice
Genetic engineering measures may not be carried out on persons who are unable to give their consent
Girls and young women get the future
Girls and young women take their lives into their own hands confidently and actively
But they are often treated as inferior and educated to put their own needs aside
Youth work is still boys' work
This undermines girls' self-esteem and later prevents them from seizing their opportunities to the same extent as boys
The federal government's budget cuts have disproportionately affected the promotion of girls
Young women are affected to an even greater extent than boys by a shortage of apprenticeships and unemployment
Young women in eastern Germany have particularly poor prospects
We want to significantly improve the opportunities for girls when choosing a career and finding an apprenticeship, at university and when overcoming the "second threshold", after training to employment
Support programs, counseling and quotas will be instruments we use to achieve our goal of giving young women a truly level playing field
Equal opportunities will not become a reality if girls and boys are treated in the same way
Therefore, education, training and continuing education must be geared toward questioning traditional gender roles
and addressing sexual violence and counterstrategies
Outlaw violence against women
The 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing revealed the appalling extent of violence against women worldwide
Violence against women is an expression of the unequal balance of power between men and women
It has many faces and can be found all over the world
The most common forms are sexualized violence in and outside marriage, sexual "abuse" and sexual exploitation, trafficking in women and girls, forced prostitution and female genital mutilation
In addition to prevention measures and comprehensive victim protection, which includes a victim advocate, for example, these crimes must be prosecuted more effectively and punished more appropriately
In Germany, every second rape and assault is committed within the family and social circle
Violence against women is often still seen as a private matter, but protection against violence is a state responsibility
Adequate provision of shelters for women and girls is therefore an essential prerequisite
After 25 years, the German Bundestag finally decided that rape is punishable, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a husband or a "stranger"
Thanks to the initiative of Alliance 90/The Greens, at the last moment the majority in parliament also overturned the contradiction rule, according to which the wife can withdraw the complaint and the rapist is then no longer prosecuted
The wife can no longer be blackmailed by her husband into withdrawing the complaint
This is a great success
However, there is one fly in the ointment: a different penalty still applies if the woman who has been raped is disabled
There is still a two-tier system of criminal law here
Alliance 90/The Greens stand by their position: Equal punishment for the same crime
Combating trafficking in women and girls
Thousands of foreign women are forced into prostitution in Germany
They are recruited in their home country through seemingly reputable artist agencies, agents for domestic workers, promises of marriage or even openly for prostitution
The current immigration law favours the business of human traffickers by illegalizing the activities of women
It prevents effective prosecution because witnesses are deported immediately after being apprehended
That is why half of all cases against the few human traffickers who are ever caught have to be dropped for lack of evidence
Trafficking in women and girls and forced prostitution can only be curbed through improved international cooperation in the prosecution of perpetrators
This is only promising if, within the framework of victim and witness protection programs, foreign women who have been forced into prostitution in Germany are granted the right to stay for the duration of the criminal proceedings and are then given the opportunity to leave the profession
Furthermore, prostitution must be recognized as a professional activity
Lesbians mix
The state and society do not have to dictate how people shape their (love) lives
Equal recognition of all lifestyles is a goal of Green politics
We therefore advocate social recognition of lesbian lifestyles
This is the start on the road to equal treatment
Lesbian partnerships must be given equal rights in childbearing law, adoption and custody, tenancy law, tax law, inheritance law and immigration law
End discrimination against prostitutes
Prostitution is not banned in Germany, but according to prevailing case law it is "immoral"
The consequence: prostitutes cannot sue for their fees
Prostitutes are denied any protection and social security
They are not entitled to unemployment, pension and statutory health insurance, nor to protection under labor law or decent working conditions
On the other hand, prostitutes must of course pay income and sales tax
We want to end discrimination against prostitutes, which means: Restricted areas must be lifted,
prostitutes need the possibility to sue for their claims,
and prostitution must be recognized as a professional activity
Women's rights are human rights
The rape of women in war, genital mutilation and forced abortions are fundamental human rights violations and grounds for asylum that we recognize
This also applies to persecution on the basis of sexual orientation
To date, gender-specific persecution has not been recognized as grounds for asylum in Germany
We want to change this
The Aliens Act is particularly discriminatory for foreign wives: A marriage between a German and a woman from a non-EU country must last four years before the wife receives an independent right of residence
If the marriage fails earlier, a woman can only obtain an immediate right of residence in cases of exceptional hardship, whereby the situation in the country of origin is also taken into account
If she has to draw social welfare in Germany, she is still threatened with deportation Precisely
because of violence against women, we advocate an independent right of residence for foreign spouses, regardless of the duration of the marriage
We want to end the discriminatory practice of detecting so-called marriages of convenience
Shaping the future through education and science
In a society that is increasingly based on information and knowledge, education plays a decisive role in determining social opportunities and the possibilities for shaping social life
Education and science play a key role in overcoming global problems
Education and science are central prerequisites for sustainability, ecological reforms and the development of a civil society based on solidarity The
changing demands of society require comprehensive reforms and the expansion of the education and science system
Yet for years, funding for schools and universities has been cut
The federal government has abandoned the consensusthat education as an individual right is open to all groups of the population
With the dismantling of state support for education, access to higher education is increasingly becoming the privilege of the better-off
The encrusted structures of educational and scientific institutions, their chronic underfunding and misinvestment jeopardize the future viability of society
Rapid and far-reaching reforms are essential
Education and science:
Cornerstones of a sustainable and just society
Alliance 90/The Greens want to ensure the right to education for all at all stages of life
Education as a lifelong process is not only decisive for career opportunities, but also a prerequisite for self-determination and the ability to responsibly shape one's own life and social development
The focus of green education policy is on teaching the basics that enable people to constantly adapt to change, acquire new knowledge and reflect critically on it
Education includes qualifications directly relevant to the profession and the ability to understand ecological, economic, social, cultural and international contexts
This is not just about initial training, which we want to secure for all young people
Precisely because the demands on employees' knowledge and skills have increased, ensuring comprehensive and varied further training in the various phases of life and work is becoming increasingly important
Green education policy also focuses on environmental education
It must be incorporated into all areas of education
Environmental education centers offer good opportunities for institutional anchoring
Alliance 90/The Greens want to make education and science the cornerstone of a sustainable, democratic and just society
We see those involved in childcare facilities, schools, dual vocational training, further education institutions and universities as partners in the reform process
We rely on a broad alliance and close dialog between those who are directly involved in educational processes and those who, as representatives of our society in science, trade unions, business and associations, have a right to help shape the education system and should actively exercise this right
Green education and science policy focuses on democratic self-determination and social responsibility instead of state paternalism
And we want to open up the education and science system to social issues - especially in the environmental field
At international level, the comparability and recognition of qualifications must be improved
Alliance 90/The Greens want to create the necessary framework conditions at federal level to enable the Länder to exercise their competences in the field of education and science appropriately
This includes:? better interlinking and permeability of the various educational sectors,
? the preservation, expansion and reform of dual vocational training,
? Programs for the advancement of girls and women in education,
? Securing labor market-oriented support in cooperation with schools, youth welfare services and the Federal Employment Agency,
? a framework law for the organization of the continuing education sector,
? comprehensive changes to the Higher Education Framework Act,
? a research promotion law and last but not least
? securing the livelihood of students and pupils
The reallocation and provision of additional financial resources, especially for the federal states, is necessary
Alliance 90/The Greens want a turnaround in education funding: funding for education and science is an investment in the future of the younger generation and society as a whole
Ensure the right to education for young people
All young people must have the right to vocational training
The future prospects of young people depend crucially on an efficient training sector and a sufficient supply of training places
Alliance 90/The Greens want to strengthen the dual vocational training system and reform its quality
and ensure the financing of training places
Green policy also focuses on young people's chances of finding a job after completing their training
The rapid development and implementation of new job profiles must take account of the transition to a service- and high-tech-oriented working society
The constructive work of the collective bargaining parties in this area in recent years must be continued
There is a particular need to catch up in the social services sector
In addition to professional practice, the demands on general education are growing
Therefore, the learning content, learning and working methods in companies and vocational schools must be adapted to the changed requirements of the world of work in order to train young people to become independent, emancipated and versatile skilled workers
To achieve this, the quality of training must be maintained, but vocational school teaching must be modernized and the second vocational school day must be retained
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate an extension of the training authorization: the decisive factor is the qualification and not the master craftsman title
A reform in this area can create new training places
Training places have been continuously reduced in recent years
Many companies and businesses neglect the qualification of junior staff
Alliance 90/The Greens want to introduce a pay-as-you-go system at the Federal Employment Agency to finance new training places
As long as companies and the public sector do not provide enough training places, employers who - in terms of turnover - do not train enough young people should be required to pay a levy to finance them
This levy is intended to benefit companies that provide above-average training
The priority is to create new in-company training places, but also places in training alliances
In structurally weak regions, for example in eastern Germany, the levy is intended to create additional places in special training companies
Micro-enterprises and start-ups are exempt from the levy
Equality and special support for girls in vocational training must be legally and financially anchored
They are underrepresented in the dual system
That is why the quota for women must be increased
Disadvantaged people, such as young people without school-leaving qualifications, foreign young people or people with learning disabilities, have an independent right to a nationally recognized education
We want to reverse the funding cuts in this area and guarantee their special support
In order to better anchor young people's opportunities for co-determination during training, Alliance 90/The Greens are calling for the rights of youth representatives to be expanded
Promote lifelong learning
Lifelong learning is indispensable
However, continuing education structures have not kept pace with social development
Although the continuing education sector has grown steadily in recent years, and many offerings in the commercial and non-commercial sectors are innovative, overall this area of education is not very clear, quality is often questionable, and the certification of qualifications is unregulated
Access must be open to all, and continuing education must appeal above all to educationally disadvantaged groups
Alliance 90/The Greens want flexible and needs-based structuring in modules for greater transparency and quality assurance
In this context, employees in continuing education must have selection rights and decision-making authority
Existing educational institutions should be better interlinked and included in the concepts of support
Alliance 90/The Greens will reform the Vocational Training Act in accordance with these requirements and
present a framework law for continuing education at the federal level
This is not intended to nationalize this area, but to ensure transparency, minimum standards and nationally recognized proof of the education acquired
The right to educational leave must be enshrined in law in all federal states
Reshaping universities and science
Higher education and science policy must meet the social requirements for a broad scientific education and provide the necessary framework for sustainable research and development
This requires an adequately funded public and pluralistic higher education system
Alliance 90/The Greens rely on the stakeholders at universities
Only by opening up room for manoeuvre - combined with comprehensive democratization - can the reform potential of universities become productive
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate the independence of universities in financial, personnel and planning matters
Democratic decision-making structures with the equal participation of all university members and an effective administration are a prerequisite for making this autonomy meaningful
In future, university boards of trustees are to be set up in the regions to mediate between universities and the state on the one hand and between universities and the general public, to whom the universities are primarily responsible, on the other
Part of a comprehensive democratization is the nationwide introduction of constituted student bodies with a general political mandate
The equal participation of women at all levels in universities must be enshrined in law
A decisive obstacle to the further development of universities is their personnel structure
Alliance 90/The Greens will focus on reforming these corporatist structures
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want:? civil servant status in the science sector
and abolish the habilitation,
? remuneration based on performance and commitment,
? remove obstacles for women through a consistent funding policy and use the upcoming generational change to significantly increase the proportion of women in the scientific community
Alliance 90/The Greens want to upgrade teaching at universities
Teaching skills must play a central role in teacher recruitment
Young scientists must be taught didactic skills
Furthermore, a qualified range of further training must be ensured for all teachers
At universities, the assessment of the teaching offer (evaluation) and its further development with the equal participation of teachers and students should become a permanent task
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN advocate a reform of the study structure
Students should have the opportunity to choose from a diverse range of courses and design their studies in an interdisciplinary way
The permeability and modularization of degree courses plays a central role in making it much easier to switch between degree courses and universities
Alliance 90/The Greens want to launch an immediate program with equal emphasis on the advancement of women,
Library and teaching equipment
and university construction
In addition to basic funding in line with their tasks and workload, the universities are to receive additional funding for initiatives such as the advancement of women, student advisory services, co-determination, evaluation and sustainability projects
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN reject tuition fees and further hurdles in the form of an assessment of eligibility to study that goes beyond the Abitur or internal university selection procedures and want to place university access on a broader basis
In addition to the general higher education entrance qualification, the entrance qualifications must be extended by vocational training or similar practical fields and equivalent non-European qualifications
Access must be made easier for foreign students
Alliance 90/The Greens reject the exclusion of foreign students through the tightening of immigration law
We support increased cooperation between universities worldwide, especially with countries in the "Third World"
The latest changes to the Higher Education Framework Act do not solve the problems of universities or are aimed in the wrong direction
Alliance 90/The Greens want to anchor their reform priorities in the higher education framework law in order to give the Länder the necessary freedom to shape and implement them
For a demand-oriented and
Parent-independent student financing
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN place a focus on the development of needs-based and parent-independent student funding
In the course of increasing equal opportunities, BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN advocate the reintroduction of student education funding as a subsidy for high school students from low-income families Student
funding should enable all students in Germany to study regardless of their social background and nationality - without being forced into gainful employment, to earn a living
Parent-independent student funding for all is more than a BAFöG reform for a few
It is a basic prerequisite for a new beginning in higher education policy
Only by expanding student funding into a legal entitlement for all students can social barriers be dismantled and a university education that is optimal in terms of quality, scope and duration be made possible,
With the Federal Training Assistance Fund (BAFF), we have developed our own model that guarantees everyone a means of subsistence that is independent of their parents and covers their needs
takes into account the unequal starting conditions depending on origin BAFF is
to be financed from public funds - by reallocating benefits from the Family Burden Equalization Scheme and by contributions from former recipients - depending on social origin and income There is
no link to examinations during studies The
same regulations apply to support for studying abroad and for foreign students as for studying in Germany for domestic students
Research for sustainable development
Science, research and technology have a major influence on our society
Innovations are also of great importance for economic development
This is why Alliance 90/The Greens advocate a reorientation of research and innovation towards sustainable development and future viability in both national and international research policy
Research policy must open up development options for a future worth living
Technical innovations that offer opportunities for improving the quality of life without causing environmental damage must therefore be promoted
Instead of the increasing focus of publicly funded research on short-term economic viability and the interests of individual companies, it is necessary to turn to pressing social problems and focus on ecologically and socially sustainable modernization
It is therefore important to involve potential addressees in research and development processes at an early stage and to interlink them more closely with socio-ecological technology assessment
In general, not only technical but also social developments must be increasingly recognized and promoted as an opportunity to shape a future worth living
In order to achieve this, Alliance 90/The Greens want to promote scientific initiatives in which problems are dealt with on an interdisciplinary basis
This science should therefore combine basic and design-oriented research, incorporate regional and global levels of analysis as well as long-term time horizons, and it must develop ecologically and socially compatible options for people to take action in their everyday lives
In the long term, sustainable development will only be promoted with a research policy in which - as demanded by many scientists and increasingly also by industry - technological, social, ecological and economic aspects are considered simultaneously and with equal priority
A reorientation of federal funding policy is necessary
Alliance 90/The Greens want to expand and redefine the existing funding programs in the areas of "Energy" and "Environment"
The technical prerequisites must be created and new concepts for energy management and energy services developed in order to establish an environmentally compatible energy system
Sustainable management requires higher resource productivity and a reduction in toxic and waste flows
A "Sustainable Technology" program is intended to promote corresponding developments
The adherence to the risky and unproductive technologies of nuclear energy, nuclear fusion, manned space flight, genetic engineering, armaments and the Transrapid must be ended
Alliance 90/The Greens stand up for freedom of research
It opens up scope for alternative approaches and new problem-solving strategies
This is why free, knowledge-oriented basic research is indispensable
The freedom of science and research finds its limits where human dignity is violated,
violates other fundamental rights
or unmanageable risks are taken
At a time when science has made it possible to build weapons of mass destruction and when genetic engineering, cloning and embryo manipulation can be used to tear down all natural boundaries, science must be held accountable to society
Scientists and research institutions must face up to this responsibility
We advocate the creation of a suitable legal framework to ensure that all employees can participate freely in open and public discourse without fear of discrimination, particularly with regard to the risks and dangers associated with their work or their company
Alliance 90/The Greens want to increase the publicity and transparency of research through the democratization of scientific organizations, the discursive and broad-based formulation of guiding principles and research programmes, the early publication of research results and the disclosure of third-party funding
Sport for everyone and anyone
ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS want to open up participation in sports to all citizens
More than before, all population groups should be able to participate in sports
This requires a redirection of sports funding in favor of mass sports and all groups that have so far been underrepresented in sports
To this end, we want to specifically promote the equal democratic participation of young people, women and migrants in decision-making processes in cooperation with organized sports
Civil rights, democracy and public safety
A modern and sustainable society must face up to the new demands on the welfare state
and, at the same time, shape itself democratically
Increasing existential fears go hand in hand with the disintegration of social ties
Irresponsibility and criminality, racism and hatred of minorities are the result
Many people increasingly live with a feeling of insecurity Fear of losing one's
After the fear of losing one's job or social security, there is often the fear of crime
This development is the result of a policy aimed at idolizing success, at an elbow society, at the exclusion of the weak and at the dismantling of democratic rights of participation, The
challenges posed by rapid social change are being met with authoritarian and helpless concepts The
Kohl government is trying to divert attention from its failures by creating images of the enemy while at the same time dismantling civil rights and democracy
ALLIANCE90/THE GREENS want to make this country fit for the future with the principles of solidarity, equal rights, protection of civil rights and expansion of democracy
We are the party that stands up for civil rights
Expanding civil rights and democracy
Standing up for civil rights is a root of Green politics in both East and West
We want to counter the rapid dismantling of civil rights standards and disenchantment with the state with a democracy offensive
Direct influence on political decisions, especially between elections, for example through referendums and the introduction of rights of action for associations,
as well as a right to inspect files, strengthen trust in democracy
Together in solidarity and equality
The democratic consensus of a society is demonstrated by how it deals with minorities
Part of living together without fear is that asylum seekers, refugees and migrants are guaranteed a secure legal status
We need refugee law that effectively protects refugees and secures the right to asylum, humane settlement and immigration law and modern citizenship law An
anti-discrimination law should anchor the consistent protection of all minorities
Public safety through prevention
Many citizens feel insecure in their living environment
Only together, with the competence of citizens, with the municipalities and associations, the churches and citizens' initiatives, as well as a police force that is close to the citizens, can security and the feeling of security be increased
We want to address the causes of crime and reduce the number of crimes with social prevention measures - for example, in youth policy - and with a new drug policy
Criminal law urgently needs to be reformed and humanized The
prevention of crime, not the conviction of a criminal, must become the primary goal of politics
Expanding civil rights and democracy
Active participation in political decisions and the transparency of government action are more important than ever
We are countering growing disenchantment with the state and the rapid dismantling of civil rights standards with a democracy offensive
It is essential for the expansion and development of democracy that everyone can freely and unhindered express and disseminate their opinions publicly, demonstrate and protest
The right to demonstrate must therefore be restored
Democracy needs a climate of tolerance and respect for the civil rights of all
However, freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate have their limits where people are denied their right to exist or their human dignity
The ban on wearing masks and the ban on wearing protective clothing must be lifted
and decriminalize actions of non-violent resistance such as sit-in blockades
A general right of access to non-personal public sector files is intended to strengthen the control of government and administration
This will also make it easier to combat corruption and haggling
In principle, everyone must also have the right to inspect documents that the authorities prepare about their own person
At the same time, the protection of citizens' personal data must be improved by a new data protection law
The same high standards must be created in the private sector as in public administration
It is unacceptable that a flourishing trade is being conducted with the private data of the population
We are committed to making the right of petition a democratic right of participation and complaint and therefore want to strengthen the complaints and petitions committees at federal and state level
A right of action for associations is intended to provide an opportunity to take legal action against major projects where there are general interests and the powers of individual citizens are not sufficient
Children and young people should be involved in decisions that affect them in a binding manner
We want the voting age and the right to participate in referendums to be lowered to the age of 16
Reach the age of
The introduction of popular initiatives, petitions and referendums is intended to finally fulfill the mandate of the Basic Law, according to which state power is exercised by the people "in elections and referendums"
They are an opportunity for more active political participation by citizens
The people should also be able to make the final decision on constitutional amendments and international treaties that transfer national sovereignty rights to international organizations
However, referendums and plebiscites must not jeopardize the constitution's protection of fundamental rights and minorities
Suitable procedural safeguards must be created for this purpose
We demand more democracy and democratic control, especially for the European Union
There must be no extension of the competences of European institutions without a simultaneous decisive extension of the powers of control by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice
More citizen proximity and transparency of the administration
The necessary modernization of the state is inconceivable without committed, goal- and result-oriented administration
The guiding principle of administration must be oriented toward service for citizens' interests
The reduction of cumbersome bureaucracy reduces the large financial burdens on public budgets
We want to offer incentives for saving and prevent waste of funds This is made
possible by standards of efficiency, performance incentives for employees, decentralized organization and forward-looking presentation of costs, as well as through time and quality management
Transparency and public access to files, task rotation and intelligent internal controls are intended to minimize corruption
The "traditional principles of the civil service" are to be deleted from the Basic Law
Teachers and university professors, for example, do not have to be civil servants In the
future, tenure in the civil service will become the exception,
Only individual sovereign tasks - certain areas of the police, administration of justice and financial administration - are to be transferred to civil servants
Modern personnel policy with more personal responsibility for employees and performance-based opportunities for advancement must replace Prussian regulatory and authoritarian thinking as well as rigid hierarchies
Management positions are to be awarded only on a temporary basis
Administrative reform must be used for the advancement of women
This includes not only equality and quotas
We want qualified mixed jobs, We want tointroduce models for flexible weekly working hours, working time accounts, "sabbatical years", part-time work for older employees and improved opportunities for career exit and re-entry
We want to consistently pay civil servants and employees in line with their function and performance
The seniority levels, according to which salaries have so far risen with increasing age, will be abolished
Responsibility for German history
We face up to our responsibility for German history
We are committed to the full recognition, legal rehabilitation and compensation of all victims of National Socialism
We want a comprehensive rehabilitation law and the establishment of a federal foundation that enables victims to receive pension payments
The extensive exclusion of victims of National Socialism in Eastern Europe from receiving compensation pensions is unacceptable to us
Remembrance and documentation work must also be initiated for the forgotten victim groups
The Federal Archives Act must not continue to hinder historical reappraisal
Although the injustice of the GDR is not comparable to the atrocities of National Socialism, the same is true here: there can be no end to the process of coming to terms with injustice
Our treatment of the victims is the yardstick for how we assess the injustice of the GDR
The rehabilitation and compensation laws for GDR injustice must lead to improved benefits, especially in old age
Insofar as this is still possible by constitutional means, the perpetrators must be held criminally responsible
Legal certainty and material justice in the new federal states also means that people who acquired houses or land in good faith during the GDR era will retain their property
Successor regulations to the Unification Treaty, which reinforce the principle of restitution before compensation, must be corrected as far as legally possible
The results of the land reform from the period 1945-1949 must not be called into question
Rents for recreational land ("dachas") must remain affordable for the population
Ensuring media diversity, press freedom and cultural diversity
Media and cultural policy in Germany is primarily a matter for the federal states
We are committed to journalistic diversity and the development of an open and democratic media and communication structure
These include public service and non-commercial broadcasting as counterweights to private commercial broadcasting
We want to maintain the federal financial equalization of ARD fees
Digital television cannot only consist of pay TV
Access for non-pay-TV providers must be mandatory and diversity must be guaranteed in terms of regulatory policy
Major events, such as sports competitions, must not be reserved for wealthy pay-TV customers
The Internet and mailboxes offer new opportunities for open, diverse and democratic communication
We therefore reject censorship measures
The necessary prosecution of child pornography and other criminal content does not require new laws, but rather better technical equipment for law enforcement authorities
Users leave data traces in electronic networks
Sensitive personal data is transported here
We therefore want improved regulations on data and consumer protection
The press has an important control function in a democracy
A comprehensive right to refuse to give evidence should improve the protection of press freedom against access by the police and public prosecutor's office
Media concentration is leading to ever greater standardization of the media landscape
The expansion of internal press freedom is therefore all the more necessary
To this end, editorial freedom and the co-determination of journalists must be strengthened in the Press Law Framework Act
Cultural diversity and artistic freedom are central to the existence of a democratic society
The federal government must ensure the existence of the cultural institutions, transnational funding and cultural model projects it supports in accordance with new criteria
We want to achieve the expansion of social security regulations for artists
and maintain federal film funding through a compulsory levy on all film industries that benefit from it
The foreign cultural policy for which the federal government is responsible must be tied to criteria that facilitate understanding and democratic development between peoples
and which help to reduce prejudice and xenophobia
Redefining the relationship between state and church
Alliance 90/The Greens defend the freedom of religious and ideological activity
as well as the ideological neutrality of the state
In a secular and pluralistic society, church and state must be separate
The churches and many Christian grassroots initiatives are often valuable allies for us, e.g. in the fight against the elbow society and for a humane foreigner and social policy
thorough discussion process with churches, religious and ideological communities and society, we want to develop new forms of financing work in the sociopolitical sphere The
church tax, which has been collected by the state up to now, is to be replaced in the medium term by membership fees,
We want to promote integrative and multicultural learning in the areas of practical life, ethics and religious studies, independently of denominational religious instruction
Military chaplaincy, which has been organized by the state up to now, should be the responsibility and responsibility of the churches
General labor, social and collective bargaining law must also apply to church employees
Strengthening the rights of minorities
Protection of refugees as the overriding principle of asylum policy
The right to asylum is an inalienable part of human rights and an expression of our historical responsibility
Our goal therefore remains a majority for the restoration of the fundamental right to asylum
Under the new law, no one can be recognized who comes to Germany via a neighboring country
The treatment of refugees is also an indicator of the democratic constitutional state
Together with refugee, human rights and civil rights organizations as well as committed members of the church asylum movement, Alliance 90/The Greens are campaigning against social exclusion and illegalization and for effective protection for refugees
The Federal Constitutional Court has confirmed the de facto abolition of the right of asylum in all essential points
However, it has only decided what is constitutionally permissible, not what is legally possible and humanly necessary
We therefore need legislation that makes full use of the legal scope and ensures that people fleeing torture, death, war, civil war or cruel treatment are protected
The Geneva Refugee Convention must - according to the guidelines of the High Commissioner for Refugees - be applied in full in Germany, as must the European Convention on Human Rights
We reject the current asylum law, which primarily asks about the route of flight, but not the reasons for flight, and denies asylum to those who have entered the country via a supposedly safe third country
The question of who is recognized as a refugee must not violate international refugee agreements and must take into account the individual right to asylum
At the very least, it must be ensured in a formal individual procedure whether protection is actually granted in the third country
Readmission agreements with persecuting states - e.g. Algeria - must be terminated
We want to abolish special procedures such as entry at airports, in which refugees entering the country are effectively unable to assert their rights, without replacement
We therefore need a fundamental reform of the Asylum Procedure Act
Asylum policy is also the responsibility of the European Union
However, European regulation must not lead to the dismantling of rights
The Federal Republic must ensure high constitutional standards in asylum procedures and a comprehensive concept of asylum there
We reject the sealing off of European borders and the electronic fingerprint system "Eurodac", which is used to register asylum seekers and so-called illegal entrants
In mass refugee situations, we need European regulations that guarantee rapid, unbureaucratic admission and a safe stay; all Member States must take responsibility
War and civil war refugees, conscientious objectors and deserters as well as victims of non-state persecution must receive protection under asylum law
Torture, gender-specific persecution of women or persecution based on sexual identity (homosexuality, transsexuality) are grounds for asylum and must finally be recognized as political persecution
The best interests of the child must also take priority in immigration law
Reservations against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child must be withdrawn
The Aliens Act should stipulate that the federal states can independently grant a permanent right of residence for vulnerable groups and the municipalities for individual humanitarian cases
The possibility of issuing a ban on deportation under Section 54 of the Aliens Act must be fully utilized
Alliance 90/The Greens reject the special treatment and exclusion of refugees and asylum seekers and are committed to social and legal equality
We want to abolish the "Asylum Seekers Benefits Act" with its discriminatory regulations
We strictly reject the plans to cut all social benefits for de facto refugees
And we oppose efforts to further discriminate against refugees with an asylum card
Decent minimum standards, such as access to healthcare, education and training, must be granted to all people, regardless of their right of residence
Detention pending deportation violates the principles of the rule of law
We therefore reject them
Instead of threatening the countries of origin of refugees with the withdrawal of development aid, we want development cooperation that helps to reduce the causes of flight
We have to start fighting the causes of flight at home
A first step in this direction is the prohibition of arms exports to states that violate human rights
Migration: civil rights and integration
Of the more than 7 million non-Germans in the country, far more than half have already lived here for more than 10 years, a quarter for more than 20 years
The majority of their children were born here
We no longer want, that the law on foreigners denies these migrants the most important rights and treats them as "strangers" and "guests"
For them, Germany has become their home
They must be given a secure residence status and may no longer be expelled
We support the immigrants in their demand for full citizenship rights
The German citizenship law of 1913 is the worst in Europe
It is still based predominantly on the principle of blood and descent
Where even the fact of decades of immigration is denied, future immigration cannot be shaped humanely
Refusal to integrate foreigners and ethnic Germans creates serious social problems
We want to counter this democratic deficit and xenophobia with a program of integration and promote the emancipation of migrants
Facilitated naturalization serves integration
Overcoming lawlessness with a settlement law
EU citizenship gives migrants from EU countries more extensive rights than other migrants
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want to achieve the greatest possible legal equality of citizens from third countries with citizens of the European Union with a settlement law
The Settlement Act should apply to all those who have been living legally in Germany for at least three years instead of the restrictive law on foreigners
It includes rights of political activity, democratic participation and social protection
It also provides planning security for those who have not yet acquired the right to a German passport
The right to vote in local elections that applies to EU citizens must also be introduced for third-country nationals
An independent right of residence for foreign spouses, regardless of the duration of the marriage, is indispensable precisely because of the violence against women
With a new citizenship law
End injustice
A new citizenship law should give all children born in Germany a German passport if at least one parent has their permanent center of life here
They are nationals and must no longer be treated as foreigners
Citizenship law must be changed in such a way that the land principle is given equal status with the principle of descent
After five years, foreigners living here must be granted the right to naturalization
Discretionary naturalization must be possible beforehand
Both instruments need to be stripped of bureaucratic red tape
The recognition of dual citizenship is long overdue - not only for those who are denied the necessary naturalization by their countries of origin
With a transparent
Procedure Shape immigration humanely
Germany has long been a country of immigration
We want to regulate future immigration with transparent procedures
This will also reduce fears among the population about further immigration An
immigration law puts the country in a position to respond to immigration processes in a social, humane and democratic way On the
On the one hand, it is intended to ensure that migrant workers can come to Germany if a job is available for them
other hand, at least a quarter of all immigration permits should be issued for humanitarian reasons, because we do not want a law that merely accepts work
This must be combined with measures for integration, such as language courses
The right to family reunification must be preserved, and equal rights must be ensured for civil partnerships that are legally barred from marrying,
After a transitional period, ethnic German immigrants should be placed on an equal legal footing with all other immigrants
Tolerance should not be confused with indifference
A functioning multicultural society must also be able to deal with conflict
The law on foreigners must not be criminal law
We reject the practice of deportation as an additional de facto punishment
It is a particular scandalif young people born and raised here are deported
Without equal inclusion of migrants living in Germany in the resolution of conflicts, without opening all professions to these people and without promoting the civil rights and integrative work of migrants' associations, multicultural conflicts cannot be resolved and integration is impossible
For an anti-discrimination law
A society's democratic consensus can be seen in the way it deals with minorities
There is often a wide gap between the prohibition of discrimination in the constitution and its implementation in everyday life
Many European countries have enacted anti-discrimination laws
The Kohl government has so far refused to do so
With an anti-discrimination law (ADG), we want to give disadvantaged minorities effective means of defending themselves against hostility and discrimination
Anyone who is disadvantaged on the basis of his or her ethnic origin, origin or affiliation, skin color, nationality, religious beliefs, sexual identity or disability should in future be entitled to compensation for damages and pain and suffering
Measures must also be taken to combat discrimination against older people
Both the affected persons themselves and associations of affected persons should be able to enforce claims for removal and injunctive relief, e.g. against discriminatory employers or landlords
Special regulations for disabled people, gays and lesbians and migrants are needed to eliminate existing legal inequalities and barriers
At the same time, we want to expand anti-violence programs for all minorities to prevent violence
Minorities are declared scapegoats by many people who are suffering from failed economic and social policies
Our ADG aims to provide legal protection against such tendencies for those under threat in order to push back marginalization and disparagement
Equal participation for people with disabilities
We oppose the anti-disability tendencies in our society, in which the "usefulness" of people or "life worth living" and "life not worth living" are discussed and in which, despite the persecution of disabled people during the Nazi era, voices are repeatedly raised in favor of the "euthanasia" of severely disabled people
The ADG must finally enable people with disabilities to participate equally in the life of the community
The needs of people with disabilities must be protected by law when it comes to access to public transport, telecommunications and building law
The sign language of deaf people must be recognized as a language in its own right
In addition to the obligation to gradually remove transport barriers, the legal options for people with disabilities and their organizations are to be strengthened
Strengthening participation rights also changes the role of disabled people in society: away from being the object of others' care and towards being the subject of their own lives
Equal rights for gays and lesbians
Gays and lesbians have long since ceased to accept discrimination and disregard in silence, but are committed to fighting for equal rights
The European Parliament, on the initiative of the Greens, has recommended minimum standards for the civil rights of lesbians and gays
We want to implement these standards in the Federal Republic of Germany
Same-sex partnerships must be given the same opportunities as heterosexual partnerships to legally structure their cohabitation: Marriage law and opening of all regulations for non-marital cohabitation
We want protection against discrimination in the world of work and in tenancy law,
elimination of discrimination in the law on associations, adoption, children and youth welfare,
ensuring data protection An
active equality policy for gays and lesbians should strengthen and promote self-determined structures in the fields of counseling, communication, art, science and youth culture A federal
government commissioner's office should be established
To combat anti-homosexual violence, we call for a federal-state program with the following cornerstones:
Support for homosexual anti-violence projects,
assistance for victims of violence,
sensitization of the police and judiciary,
research into the extent and causes of violence,
education and prevention programs for groups willing to use violence
Strengthen public safety -
Prevent crime
Prevention of crime
Public safety is a question of quality of life
Crime, harassment and aggression in traffic create a feeling of insecurity
One-dimensional answers do not go far enough
We focus on a cause-oriented approach to crime
The fight against poverty, unemployment, lack of prospects and discrimination must be the primary goal of politics,
The federal government, on the other hand, is fighting the poor instead of poverty
We reject a policy of fear We are
against further tightening of criminal laws
They do not contribute to reducing crime
They do not create more security
Instead, victim assistance and resocialization measures must be expanded
Public security is a joint task of society and not the sole domain of the police and the judiciary
Alliance 90/The Greens are committed to a civil society security model: We support the establishment of municipal prevention councils
Citizens, associations, churches and authorities can work together to improve security with the support of the police
Prevention includes measures for safety in the district through a change in urban development, construction and traffic policy
They are intended to enliven public spaces and make them safer
Prevention work against violent crime must also take place in schools and educational work
The focus here should be on the group of young men, as they are predominantly perpetrators and victims of violent crime
Women and children should be empowered to defend themselves in emergency situations
They are particularly affected by domestic violence
To enable the police and judiciary to concentrate more on the prosecution of violent and serious crime, economic and tax-related crime, law enforcement agencies must be relieved of tasks such as private security, guarding soccer stadiums, recording minor traffic accidents or prosecuting hashish users
Private security services must be restricted by law
We are in favour of Europe-wide police cooperation against cross-border organized crime
However, unlike Europol, such cooperation must be democratically organized and controlled
European police institutions such as Europol should be subject to the control of the European Parliament, the parliaments of the individual states and the European Court of Justice
The immunity regulation for Eurocops must be abolished
The Greens support the federal structure of the police force
Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Police Office must be reduced to its original tasks
We are against the increasing deployment of the Federal Border Guard in city centers
Alliance 90/The Greens reject the "Big Eavesdropping Attack" as an encroachment on fundamental rights
It is also criminally ineffective
The powers to monitor confidential communications have been extended from year to year
We call for a systematic review and legal restriction of these measures
The parliaments must be informed regularly
We condemn the bugging of homes as a matter of principle
It therefore remains our goal to organize a majority for the restoration of the fundamental right to inviolability of the home
Nevertheless, we want to tighten the rule of law barriers to eavesdropping, in particular the intervention thresholds and the judicial reservation, and expand strict individual notification obligations and the public reporting obligation
Secret services have lost almost all their tasks
New fields of activity (e.g. Scientology) are desperately sought in order to create jobs.
The confrontation with extremist ideologies, especially right-wing extremist ideologies, can only be achieved democratically through public discussion in society
The police and judiciary are responsible for combating crimes committed by criminal organizations and have suitable instruments at their disposal in the form of criminal law
The secret services should be gradually disbanded
As long as this has not happened, their intelligence powers in particular must be limited.
and parliamentary control should be improved
Alliance 90/The Greens want to contribute to a social climate that denies right-wing extremists a foothold
It goes without saying that racist and neo-Nazi crimes must be consistently prosecuted
In order to strengthen social resistance and civil courage, we demand the right for employees to refuse the production and distribution of right-wing extremist propaganda
Health policy instead of criminal law:
For a turnaround in drug policy
The German government is blocking the urgently needed change in drug policy for ideological reasons
The result of the coalition government's policy is a steady stabilization of organized crime's profits from illegal trafficking
Procurement crime and prostitution on the one hand, and the impoverishment of addicts on the other, continue to rise unabated
The Narcotics Act is still a means of criminal law, hard and soft drugs are equally criminalized
Consumers of soft drugs thus continue to come into conflict with the law - despite the "hashish ruling" of the Federal Constitutional Court, there is still no nationwide regulation
The current laws turn millions of users of cannabis products and party drugs into criminals
Alliance 90/The Greens want a fundamental change in drug policy
The key to such a turnaround lies in healthcare policy
Drug policies that use repression to enforce an addiction-free society and arbitrarily classify substances as dangerous drugs according to subjective criteria, even though scientific reports have long attested the opposite, are doomed to failure
The Narcotics Act must be reformed and the focus must be on prevention and health protection instead of the threat of punishment
In order to separate the markets for such different drugs as heroin and cannabis and to be able to combat illegal structures effectively, we are calling for the legalization of certain drugs such as hashish under similar legal protection regulations as alcohol
However, the distribution of drugs to children and young people up to the age of 16 must remain prohibited for hashish as for alcohol
Advertising for legal drugs of all kinds must be restricted
To protect consumers, we are calling for targeted educational work
Ecstasy and other designer drugs are spreading rapidly
An urgently needed immediate measure is the creation of opportunities for penalty-free chemical testing of these substances (ecstasy pills, etc.) to protect against dangerous contamination or overdose
In the case of drugs that should not be legalized, e.g. heroin, we rely on help instead of punishment: in England and Switzerland, positive experiences have been made with state-controlled heroin distribution
This can break the vicious circle of social misery, drug-related crime and renewed drug addiction
The possibility of state-controlled dispensing of hard drugs and substitutes by doctors to addicts is long overdue
The time of model projects is over, only nationwide substitution programs and the distribution of the original drug can prevent drug-related crime
Substitution programs and the dispensing of original substances must be accompanied by adequate psychosocial support
Decentralized counselling centres and health rooms should be set up to prevent infections and protect potential victims, especially homeless drug addicts, as well as syringe machines
In principle, there must be a redistribution of public funds away from law enforcement measures towards a qualitative expansion of assistance and drug prevention as well as addiction research
Criminal law reform
The symbolic policy of tougher penalties has failed in the fight against crime
Criminal law is unsuitable for correcting undesirable social developments
Although it is the most powerful tool against criminals, it is a blunt weapon in the fight against crime
By sanctioning criminality, offenders should learn to lead a life of social responsibility without committing crimes
Imprisonment often leads to the de-socialization of prisoners
They lose their job, home and social environment
The victim of the crime is usually left empty-handed
Alliance 90/The Greens therefore want to expand victim support
We therefore advocate the expansion of conflict resolution and reconciliation as an alternative
The Federal Victims Compensation Act must also improve the assistance available to victims of crime
First the victim, then the state - fines should be used primarily to compensate victims
We want a victim advocate and other support for victims of serious bodily harm and sexual offenses
The penal code dates back to the last century
We want a reform of criminal law that emphasizes the protection of life, physical integrity and sexual self-determination over the right to property and modernizes the law on sanctions
The harmonization of penalties must be used to reduce the minimum and maximum penalties
The penal system must also be reformed
We want an increase in the remuneration of prisoners and their inclusion in the social security system
Taking into account the case law of the Federal Constitutional Court, the inhumane life sentence is to be replaced by a lengthy term of imprisonment
The instrument of preventive detention is available for serious violent and sexual offenders at risk of reoffending
Its reform must reorganize the prison system in line with the principle of proportionality and limit sentences to serious violent and sex offenders
Green crime policy focuses primarily on crime prevention
A turnaround in drug policy and social, organizational and technical prevention can significantly reduce the burden of crime on the population
Only when prevention is ineffective does the use of police and criminal law make sense
We want to: strengthen victim-offender mediation by law,
? community service as an alternative to fines or prison sentences,
? a suspension of the execution of custodial sentences subject to conditions beyond the previous probation options,
? the extension of the possibility of suspending fines on probation and
? Avoid pre-trial detention as far as possible
Modernizing criminal law also offers the opportunity to relieve the burden on the police and judiciary
In minor cases, e.g. shoplifting and fare evasion, we rely on the priority of restitution over punishment or on the law on administrative offenses
The Greens will not agree to a lowering of the age of criminal responsibility and the regular application of adult criminal law to persons between the ages of 18 and 21
We reject the introduction of electronic house arrest for short-term sentences
Criminal law relating to opinions and political criminal law must be liberalized
The so-called terrorist laws of the seventies and eighties, such as the leniency program, the contact ban law and § 129a must be repealed
The rights of defendants to be present at the trial without exception and to a proper defense must be restored
Prostitution is to be removed from the criminal milieu by recognizing it as a professional activity
As part of victim and witness protection programs, foreign women who have been forced into prostitution should be granted the right to stay for the duration of the proceedings
Crimes causing serious harm to the general public
We pay particular attention to economic and tax crime as well as environmental and corruption offenses
While "organized crime" is generally dramatized in public, these specific crimes and the damage they cause are still underestimated
The legal manufacture and trade in weapons must be restricted
Illegal arms trafficking and possession must be prosecuted more intensively
In the case of environmental crimes, the authorities must be obliged to report them and civil strict liability must be introduced, coupled with the facilitation of evidence in favor of the injured party
Corporate liability law and the criminal liability of legal persons must be regulated by law
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want: ? hierarchy-independent internal audits in all authorities,
? Rotation in vulnerable areas of employment and creation of a corruption register,
? Creation of strict procurement guidelines for public contracts,
? an effective block on awarding contracts in the event of infringements
Alliance 90/The Greens want to reform tax secrecy in such a way that its civil rights core remains protected,
but not to conceal corruption and tax offenses
or misconduct by the authorities can be abused
The fundamental right to informational self-determination must not be sacrificed under the pretext of allegedly fighting crime
Judicial Reform
We want to democratize the judiciary and thus create the legal and organizational conditions for a citizen-oriented and citizen-friendly justice system
We demand swift procedures
However, we reject the legally adopted "accelerated procedure" and detention pending trial, as these dismantle the rights of the defense and constitutional standards
BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN want: ? strict compliance with the principle of separation of powers through the introduction of an independent panel of judges
? This is intended to reduce the influence of the executive in the appointment of judges;
? the dismantling of hierarchies in the judiciary
? We strive for the equivalence of all judgeships
? Management positions in the judiciary can only be filled on a temporary basis;
? a modernization of the judicial organization and the introduction of a tripartite court structure
? A further restriction of the judicial reviewability of first-instance judgments by increasing the appeal sums is unacceptable
? In the case of gross miscarriages of justice, second-instance proceedings must be made possible under strict conditions, even if the value in dispute is low;
? a strengthening of out-of-court conflict resolution options
? Suitable forms of conciliation (mediation) should therefore be offered before a judicial solution is found
? The first instance should be set up in such a way that a prompt settlement of disputes can already be achieved there that is accepted by the citizens concerned;
? a fundamental reform of legal training
? The aim of this reform must be to train lawyers for all legal professions who are equally capable of criticism and working independently
? Theory and practice must be more closely linked
Foreign policy departure into the 21st century
Never before has the economic and technical capacity of human beings to change the earth and shape the future been as great as it is today
We need a new understanding of foreign policy so that we can learn to deal responsibly with the still incalculable consequences of our actions Shaping
life in the 21st century in an ecologically sustainable, socially just, emancipated, politically peaceful and secure way is the greatest challenge today
Responsibility for the world society and the
Assuming responsibility for the preservation of the natural foundations of life
Globalization is the great challenge for foreign policy
Numerous countries succeed in industrializing
Economic prosperity and new wealth contrast with growing poverty and ecological depletion
Catastrophes, wars, racist and sexist violence and dictatorships force millions to emigrate and flee
Globalization is exacerbating divisions in regions of unequal development and at the same time forcing their inhabitants to act cooperatively internationally as a risk community
The highly industrialized countries bear a particularly large share of the responsibility for these developments
Around 20 percent of the world's population live here and have 150 times the income of the poorest 20 percent of humanity
Globalization is changing the framework conditions of foreign policy
The possibilities for action of nation states and the constraints of globally networked production relations diverge
Politics must regain its ability to control an unleashed economy, and the relationship between trade, the environment, security and human rights must be redefined
The world community must take responsibility for global development; the globalization of the profit economy must be countered by a globalization of social solidarity
An international structural policy is necessary
There is an interest in all societies in halting the destruction of the natural foundations of life and social cohesion
This common interest in survival must be helped to prevail
Contributing to this is the most important task of German foreign policy
Alliance 90/The Greens therefore oppose a foreign policy based on the model of national power politics
This policy has no constructive answers to the global problems of the 21st century
Germany must not pursue an international policy in the national interest
We need a German policy in the international interest
Alliance 90/The Greens want a foreign and peace policy without nationalism
Green foreign policy is based on the following guiding principles: - the universal validity of human rights,
- power-political self-restraint and international integration,
- an ecologically solidary world economic order,
- the civilization and demilitarization of international politics
For an ecological and social peace order
For the reform of the UN
The current UN structure is criticized for the dominance of the rich industrialized countries, heavy bureaucratization and frequent ineffectiveness
Rightly so
Nevertheless, the United Nations is the most important level for solving global problems
Alliance 90/The Greens are therefore committed to comprehensive UN reform with the aim of strengthening the United Nations politically and financially and developing it into an effective body for solving international problems:
The resolutions of the General Meeting must be upgraded
The Security Council, the executive body of the General Assembly, must adequately represent all regions
Alliance 90/The Greens support the proposal to introduce permanent regional seats on the Security Council, which would be filled on a rotating basis
Germany should give up its demand for its own permanent seat in favor of this model
Alliance 90/The Greens call for the establishment of an international human rights court in which recognized non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are entitled to sue alongside affected persons
We strive to enshrine binding procedures for the political enforcement of human rights and non-military conflict resolution in the UN Charter
The effect of sanctions must be made more effective
Alliance 90/The Greens propose a UN sanctions relief fund from which UN members can be reimbursed for damages resulting from participation in sanctions
The great tragedies of recent years in Algeria, Kurdistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Campuchea, Bosnia, Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire show the dilemma of the international community: active intervention to preserve peace is necessary, but not always successfully possible
Lasting peace cannot be enforced militarily
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate a reorientation in international peacekeeping
Conflict prevention instruments must be expanded
The United Nations and its regional organizations also urgently need independent units to monitor sanctions, moderate conflicts and carry out peacekeeping operations under Chapter VI of the UN Charter that are neither under the command of national armies nor dependent on military alliances
We reject military peace enforcement and combat operations
Greater international cooperation is necessary to overcome global economic, social and ecological challenges
We therefore advocate the creation of a Council for the World Economy, Environment and Development alongside the United Nations Security Council
The worldwide realization of human rights
make the leitmotif of German foreign policy
Human rights are universal and indivisible
They must not be played off against each other
The catastrophic human rights situation in many countries, the social and ecological crises as well as the refugee movements are directly connected
The comprehensive advocacy of human rights also aims at eliminating the most important causes of current inter- and intra-state conflicts The
observance of human rights must be the guiding principle for all political areas and must not be subordinated to economic interests The
disregard of social human rights also implies the violation of political human rights:a regime that wants to maintain a socially unjust social order will suppress any resistance with violence
A comprehensive human rights policy must therefore withdraw support from regimes that violate human rights,
strengthen human rights organizations and social and trade union movements,
promote the legal status of women
and work for social justice and the preservation of livelihoods
In the area of political human rights, Alliance 90/The Greens want effective protection against persecution and oppression and close cooperation between all relevant agencies and NGOs in human rights, asylum and foreigners policy
Alliance 90/The Greens are particularly committed to: -the fight against torture, the death penalty and arbitrary arrests;
- the fight against racism, ethnic and sexist discrimination and the enslavement of children; -
the prohibition of all military and equipment aid to states involved in human rights violations
In order to monitor and promote human rights, Alliance 90/The Greens call for better international mechanisms and, in particular, for the expansion and strengthening of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner
German embassies are generally well informed about the human rights situation in host countries
However, comprehensive reporting and, to an even greater extent, consistent (public) comment are often omitted in deference to German interests in economic cooperation, political stability or protection of Germans in the host country
Alliance 90/The Greens call for more transparency and consistency
A step in this direction could be the establishment of human rights units in the embassies, whose analyses of the political and social situation must occupy an important place in the "Political Semi-Annual Reports" of the missions abroad as well as in the situation reports relevant to asylum policy
Furthermore, a parliamentary supervisory body should be established in Germany, to handle complaints about omitted or inadequate statements in human rights policy
ALLIANCE90/THE GREENS advocate a strengthening of the European Commission for Human Rights and a strengthening of the European Court of Human Rights
For a Europe of peace and solidarity
Alliance 90/The Greens want the political integration of Europe - of the whole of Europe
National concepts have had their day
Many problems make joint action within the framework of the European Union (EU) and its expansion into a political union indispensable
However, democracy must not fall by the wayside on the road from Bonn to Brussels
Anti-European and nationalist propaganda is fed by the mistakes of previous EU integration, which took place behind closed doors and largely lacked democratic legitimacy
The relapse into national power politics, the new nationalism, is the great challenge for Europe
Nationalism can only be countered with successful European unification
Any attempt to resurrect the nation state of the 19th century at supranational level in the 21st century is politically doomed to failure
The German federal state cannot be transferred to the European level
Alliance 90/The Greens want a new association of states in which elements of a confederation of states and a federal state come together
The political integration of European countries must be driven forward by a democratically designed constitutional process with broad civil society participation
The EU should only perform those tasks that cannot be fulfilled at the level of the municipalities, regions and member states:
Problems should be solved where it is necessary and where democratic influence is greatest
A Charter of Fundamental Rights and the establishment of common principles of the rule of law are a prerequisite for a civil rights foundation for integration
The European Parliament must become the second legislative chamber on an equal footing with the Council
Alliance 90/The Greens want an EU in which ecological and social reforms at national and European level complement and promote each other,
- the internal market is shaped jointly,
- Democracy is a guiding political principle,
- Conflict prevention has priority and military interventions are rejected
The Treaty of Amsterdam did not sufficiently strengthen the Community's civilian foreign policy, but rather opened the door further towards an EU military power through the close ties with the WEU and the launch of joint military operations, including military combat missions
We strictly reject this
The EU does not need a "military arm"
The WEU is to be dissolved as part of the further development of civil European integration
Europe is more than the EU
In Central and Eastern Europe, Alliance 90/The Greens want to strengthen democratic developments against nationalist tendencies
and support economic and social reforms
We advocate that as many Central and Eastern European countries as possible join the EU without delay
Even if this is not possible at the same time, all candidate countries, including Turkey, must be treated equally if they fulfill the political and economic conditions
In the event of further openings and expansions of the European market, undercutting of environmental standards must be ruled out
A common political umbrella for all stakeholders is needed to avoid new exclusions and divisions in Europe and to involve the candidates in the consultation on EU reforms at an early stage
What is needed is a common European policy that prevents the EU from becoming a fortress of prosperity at the expense of the South and East
Alliance 90/The Greens want a Europeanization of refugee policy on the basis of the Geneva Convention
Europe should take the first steps and make preliminary efforts to create a global society based on ecological solidarity
Such a policy is a moral obligation and a piece of material reparation in view of the responsibility that Europe bears as a result of the legacy of colonialism and imperialism
Reforming and opening up the European Union in a socio-ecological way
The EU has helped to overcome nationalism
It has enabled an era of stability in Western Europe and is a role model for many in Europe
There is no alternative to the EU
Alliance 90/Greens want to fundamentally reform the process of European integration because we want to continue it
The reforms proposed in Agenda 2000 are inadequate
A fundamental reform of agricultural and structural policy and of the financial constitution is essential, because only this will open the way to ecological restructuring and a balance of interests based on solidarity, and without it enlargement of the EU will not be possible
We oppose the unfortunate discussion about Germany as a "net contributor", because Germany must make its contribution to adequate funding and a balance between rich and poor
Alliance 90/The Greens want a triad of European reforms: democracy
- social ecology
- Europe as a whole
This requires a concrete roadmap of short-, medium- and long-term measures to set the course for greater integration and democratization and thus drive forward an institutional reform of the EU
Measured against the necessities of democratic politics and the expectations of a "Europe of the citizens", the continuation of the "Maastricht process" has failed
The successor treaty to Amsterdam has fallen short of its ambition to increase the Union's capacity to act and prepare for its eastward enlargement
He has set the wrong course: The focus is on cooperation between the police and the military
However, steps towards a social and ecological Europe are crucial
A common policy for regulating economic relations is necessary
Europe needs a stable economic policy framework - above all to combat mass unemployment - instead of leaving the economy and society to blind market forces in line with neoliberal ideology
What is needed is a pact for a sustainable economy, for an active employment and ecological restructuring policy
To this end, the EU must be equipped with the means to impose sanctions on those Member States that seek to gain competitive advantages from ecological and social dumping
A harmonized framework for tax policy, in particular a common eco-tax, is therefore essential
The nation states must transfer competencies to the supranational level if politics is to remain capable of acting
An important step is a common European currency
Alliance 90/The Greens are in favor of the introduction of the euro in accordance with the treaty and against all attempts to postpone it
However, Alliance 90/The Greens strongly advocate a political correction of the framework conditions of the monetary union: We are in favor of all EU states that can and want to participate in the euro
We are fighting for a socio-ecological, employment-effective design of European economic policy in order to take precautions against possible distortions between economically strong and weak regions as a result of the introduction of the euro
Following the inadequate results of the Luxembourg employment summit, we will not let up in our criticism of the economic policy concept of the monetary union
As necessary as democratization at European level is, the key to democratizing the EU lies at home:
National governments decide on the essential course of EU policy, even if they often hide behind "Brussels"
More transparency of decisions and an effective right of access to files vis-à-vis the EU institutions are needed
NGOs need far-reaching rights of participation, consultation and legal action in order to enable direct participation in European affairs
Demilitarization and civilization-
the keys to peace policy
Demilitarization and civilization of international politics must take place in parallel
Only through practical civil alternatives can demilitarization become credible
Only through demilitarization and the primacy of politics can it be achieved that civil conflict management is no longer subordinated to the old military thinking
Peace policy cannot hide behind alliance constraints or supposed international necessities
The Federal Republic must use its newly won sovereignty for peace policy
Unilateral disarmament steps, Unilateral disarmament steps,independent initiatives and advance efforts are necessary to make clear and advance the possibility of a different policy
Only such a strategy can create the support necessary to implement a consistent peace policy, even against the power claims of military apparatuses and the military-industrial complexes
Creating a pan-European peace order -
Strengthen the OSCE, push back NATO
The peace movements in East and West have called for the dissolution of the military blocs
The Warsaw Pact dissolved in 1991
Previously, the "Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe" (CSCE) outlined a common security system for Europe in the Charter of Paris
Leading Western states have turned down this opportunity for comprehensive disarmament
Saving NATO, which was created during the Cold War, was more important to them than building an integrated security system that would provide security for North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS states
NATO does not even rule out the possibility of the first use of nuclear weapons
Its doctrine of offering protection against "destabilization" worldwide is programming armed adventures in which Germany could also be drawn in
Alliance 90/The Greens do not accept that NATO is expanding its role at the expense of the UN and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in order to assert its own military dominance
It is necessary to strengthen preventive measures and non-military solutions that prevent crises from turning into armed conflicts
If the Western military alliance is propagated as the only guarantor of security and as a symbol of "the West", it is hardly surprising that states of the former Eastern bloc are now seeking admission
They promise themselves protection from Russia, from a united Germany, from each other and from unpredictable internal developments
A dispute has broken out within NATO as to who else should be admitted to the alliance in addition to the countries named so far
Behind this lies the unresolved question of how NATO can fulfill the expectations it has raised without either snubbing Russia again or disappointing accession hopes - and thus turning enlargement into a source of threat and isolation fears in the countries concerned
Alliance 90/The Greens believe that European security can only be achieved with and not against Russia
The Founding Act between NATO and Russia has contributed to further détente
But it also raises the question of why the Western defense alliance should be expanded instead of building a common security system when so much cooperation seems possible
In view of the ailing federal budget, it is even more irresponsible to invest money in military structures that is urgently needed to strengthen civilian foreign policy, such as the eastward expansion of the EU
The German government's refusal to vigorously pursue conventional disarmament is an indication that it is more concerned with upgrading the German military than with a pan-European peace perspective
We are pursuing the opposite goal: the long-term anti-militarist strategy of Alliance 90/The Greens aims to dissolve military alliances and national armies into a pan-European peace and security order
It must also replace NATO and offers the prerequisite for comprehensive disarmament
and the disempowerment of the military-industrial complex in all states
We are aware that a fundamental reorientation of security policy is a long-term project that extends far beyond the horizon of one government term
Peace policy ideas can only be implemented in dialog with friends and partners
A unilateral withdrawal of Germany from NATO should be rejected: It would destroy the international dialog and stir up - historically justified - fears of a German special path
But a sovereign Germany may and must make its own proposals and unilateral advance payments for the demilitarization and civilization of foreign policy
Since the false step of NATO enlargement, which has now become a political fact, has squandered the previous opportunities for a pan-European security order and created the danger of new rifts in Europe, it is now all the more important to strengthen and accelerate the processes that correspond to the goal of comprehensive security and cooperation and the civilization of international relations
The transatlantic relationship is particularly important here
In the wake of geopolitical détente, German reunification and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, Western military policy has lost its binding effect on transatlantic relations
This relationship needs a new foundation
A new transatlantic agenda must emphasize the shared responsibility of industrialized countries for global environmental, social and democratic change
Following the example of the Franco-German friendship, whose civil elements are to be deepened, Alliance 90/The Greens want to further develop friendly relations with all neighboring countries, especially with Poland and the Czech Republic
Strengthening and expanding the OSCE are decisive starting points for the creation of a new pan-European security system
Alliance 90/The Greens support the development of a common and comprehensive security model for Europe that enables the gradual transfer of nation-state sovereignty to the responsibility of the international legal community
The next key reform steps for the OSCE in this direction are - Further-reaching decision-making powers in crisis situations by expanding the competencies of the General Secretariat and the Chairmanship;
- the establishment of a political steering committee,
- the expansion of the Forum for Security Co-operation and the Economic Forum - in particular through the establishment of a sanctions authority - and of multinational peace-keeping units under the leadership of the OSCE
The participation of non-governmental organizations in civil conflict management by the OSCE is of particular importance
As a first step, Alliance 90/The Greens want Germany to make unilateral political and financial advance payments to strengthen the OSCE
Germany's commitment to a pan-European security system is only credible if a process of consistent disarmament and self-restraint in the production, procurement and export of weapons is initiated at national and European level
Germany must advocate a radical disarmament of NATO:
- for disarmament steps in the conventional field in continuation of the CFE Treaty;
- for the renunciation of nuclear weapons;
- for the immediate withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from the territory of non-nuclear-weapon states
- Germany should decide on the denuclearization of German territory and advocate the scrapping of all nuclear weapons;
- for the inclusion of the nuclear potential of Great Britain and France in the START negotiations
- We reject the communitization of nuclear weapons, for example by sharing the power of disposal over French and British nuclear weapons with other EU states;
- for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe with the participation of Germany
- and an enshrinement of the renunciation of nuclear weapons in the Basic Law
Germany should also launch an initiative for the international control of long-range military reconnaissance equipment
These are to be placed at the service of the UN, conflict prevention and disarmament control
Start with disarmament and demilitarization at home
Germany contributes to the fact that arms production and arms exports fuel violent conflicts worldwide
As a first step towards a complete phase-out of arms production, Alliance 90/The Greens call for a ban on arms exports by German companies to areas outside the EU, the USA and Canada
and end all subsidies for arms exports
Alliance 90/The Greens call for an immediate ban on the production of landmines, especially anti-tank mines, in Germany
The production of particularly cruel weapons such as landmines must be stopped worldwide through international prohibition and bans
Institutions for transnational conversion projects must be created at federal level to support industrial companies in converting to civilian products and to support federal states and municipalities in site conversion
At the same time, the German government must press for the adoption of corresponding directives and initiatives in Europe
Alliance 90/The Greens reject the restructuring of the Bundeswehr into an international intervention army through the development of crisis response forces and offensive weapons such as the "Eurofighter"
The rapid reaction forces and in particular the "Special Forces Command" must be disbanded
In particular, we oppose the procurement of new large weapon systems for the German Air Force and additional frigates and corvettes for the German Navy
We reject the establishment of new military training areas and call for the extensive conversion of existing facilities to civilian use
As a first step, we want to open up training areas such as Bergen in the Lüneburg Heath for civilian use
We will resolutely oppose the military use of the Kyritz-Wittstock Heath and the Colbitz-Letzlinger Heath
We advocate a drastic reduction in maneuver operations and a ban on all low-altitude flights
We reject public swearing-in ceremonies and other military spectacles
Military "honorary" testimonies during state visits are to be dispensed with in future
The "Defense Policy Guidelines", which provide for the worldwide defense of so-called "national interests" and the "maintenance of free world trade and unhindered access to markets and raw materials throughout the world", must be suspended immediately
The Bundeswehr, with over 300,000 soldiers, cannot be completely abolished overnight
The process of disarmament and conversion must be implemented step by step
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate the abolition of compulsory military service and thus also of civilian service
We propose a phase-out concept for civilian service with the aim of redirecting its state funding of well over DM 2 billion a year to finance full-time jobs in the social sector
We advocate the introduction of a voluntary social and ecological citizenship year
We reject a "general obligation to serve"
We stand in solidarity with all those who refuse compulsory service and oppose the inclusion of women in the Bundeswehr
With the abolition of compulsory military service and the immediate conversion to a volunteer army, the gradual dismantling of the Bundeswehr is to begin
The abolition of compulsory state service should be accompanied by a rapid reduction in the number of remaining professional and regular soldiers
At the same time, Alliance 90/The Greens want a drastic reduction in the period of service for regular soldiers
and a strengthening of the democratic rights of soldiers
With the abolition of compulsory military service, the Bundeswehr will be reduced to fewer than 200,000 soldiers
Through further disarmament steps - particularly in the area of crisis response forces - we want to reduce the Bundeswehr to around 150000 soldiers in four years' time
We also want to drastically reduce the Bundeswehr in the coming years - initially with the aim of halving it further
Our contribution to peacekeeping
At the same time, a process of transformation of the Bundeswehr must take place The
military must be retrained for peace-keeping missions
Alliance 90/The Greens do not support military peace enforcement and combat missions
For a policy of peacekeeping in accordance with Chapter VI of the UN Charter ("peace-keeping"), we want to support the creation of multinational units that are placed under the direct authority of the United Nations and the OSCE In
addition, a training center for specialized personnel for humanitarian aid and preventive forms of diplomacy, for military observation, demining and technical assistance in conflict regions In order
to demonstrate the move away from military thinking and the possibility of political alternatives, a special unit should be set up as a first step for UN/OSCE peacekeeping operations, consisting of members of the police, customs, the Federal Border Guard, retrained soldiers and civilian specialists, which is armed for self-protection and can be entrusted with police tasks under a UN/OSCE mandate
The German Bundestag decides on its deployment
The alternative:
Building an infrastructure for civil conflict transformation
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate that the federal and state governments provide funds to strengthen civil society structures in conflict regions
The establishment of a Center for Violence Prevention, which works with the OSCE's Conflict Prevention Centre, should create the conditions for this
In cooperation with non-governmental organizations, region-specific catalogs of measures are to be developed to de-escalate conflicts and strengthen democratic structures
The federal and state governments should support and co-finance the training of peace experts for deployment as part of a legally secured and internationally integrated decentralized civil peace service
Men and women are to receive several months of qualified training to enable them to prevent and contain escalations of violence or to support reconciliation processes and strengthen civil society structures after the end of (civil) wars
The federal and state governments must participate in the creation of an infrastructure for the long-term planning, support and evaluation of volunteer assignments in cooperation with NGOs
State support for the training and equipping of peace experts is to be provided in particular through participation in a transnationally organized foundation within the framework of the OSCE
Alliance 90/The Greens want to raise the social status of voluntary services
We are committed to creating the legal, political and social framework for this, in particular through a Voluntary Service Act
We want to make the promotion of peace research a central concern
Practice-oriented courses in peace and conflict research are to be set up at universities based on the American and British model
We want to promote cross-border social cooperation
We rely on the "Five for Peace" initiative to finance disarmament measures, conversion, a civilian peacekeeping contingent, the deployment of peace experts in civil conflict management projects and peace research:
The defense budget is to be reduced by at least five percent every year
Part of the money released will be made available to a Federal Office for "Disarmament, Conversion and Civil Conflict Transformation" to be set up specifically for these measures
A new North-South policy is needed
Green North-South policy aims to achieve decent living conditions and the protection and preservation of natural resources
Development means creating the conditions for people to shape their own lives free from material hardship
The guiding principle of green policy is indivisible human rights
and the principles of sustainable development as described in Agenda 21
This requires fundamental reforms and legal regulations in development policy that go far beyond the traditional understanding of development aid
Alliance 90/The Greens advocate an expansion of financial transfers from North to South
We understand development cooperation as a global structural policy for which new forms of development financing must be developed
We are committed to the Federal Republic of Germany gradually making one percent of its gross national product available for international structural and development policy
This requires reallocations in the federal budget
Development cooperation must achieve an appropriate and more effective use of scarce resources by improving planning, coordination, implementation and performance monitoring, but above all by increasing transparency and ensuring the participation of the local population
Comprehensive empowerment of women is crucial for the development of a country
It must therefore be a focus of German development cooperation
German companies and banks, in particular the public-sector Landesbanken, are required to respect all international human rights conventions in their global business activities
Poverty reduction, crisis prevention,
Promoting democracy and safeguarding the ecological future
The focal points of a green North-South policy are: -creation of humane living conditions by improving the access of poor population strata to productive resources (education, health, land, technologies and capital) and sales markets;
- peacekeeping, crisis prevention and civil conflict management;
- democratization,
promotion of human rights
and the participation of the population, especially women, in all social and economic decision-making processes; -
safeguarding the ecological future, such as protecting tropical forests, combating desertification, and promoting sustainable agriculture
Alliance 90/The Greens oppose attempts to use development cooperation to promote foreign trade Foreign
trade instruments - especially the granting of export guarantees (HERMES) - must be tied to development and environmental policy criteria
Development policy on the international
Expand and upgrade structural policy
Development policy is a cross-cutting political task: all political projects of the North that are relevant to living conditions in the South must be examined for their development compatibility: foreign, trade, economic and financial policy, agricultural policy, environmental and research policy
For example, the development of agriculture in African countries must no longer be undermined by subsidized European agricultural exports
The competencies of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development must therefore be expanded
The globalization of business and trade is largely taking place without consideration of social, ecological or ethical criteria
It contributes to the exploitation of people and nature and to the widening of the gap between rich and poor
The current draft for a "Multilateral Agreement on Investment" (MAI) in its present form represents a serious encroachment on the sovereignty and democratic constitution of states at global level
The negotiation and ratification process must be suspended until an independent and comprehensive review of its environmental, social and developmental consequences has taken place with the participation of the public and environmental and developmental non-governmental organizations and the draft treaty has been amended in accordance with the results
UNCTAD could be a suitable forum for these tasks
It is also necessary to anchor social and ecological standards in international trade within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the UN institutions responsible for environment and development,
without weakening developing countries through protectionist measures
In particular, the international environmental agreements
and the conventions of the International Labor Organization, such as the ban on child labor and the right to freedom of association, must be enforced
Global trade is of growing importance for developing countries - but they are structurally disadvantaged by the protectionist closure of the markets of industrialized countries and strong price fluctuations for their main export products
The United Nations Development Program already estimates that the losses in developing countries due to unequal market access exceed global development aid tenfold
We are therefore committed to improving market access opportunities for sustainably produced products from the poorest developing countries, for example by promoting sales in Germany
We want to promote and expand the labeling of products with a uniform seal of quality (trans-fair) whose production and distribution comply with minimum ecological and social standards
It is also important to strengthen regional south-south cooperation
Indispensable elements of an international structural policy are the upgrading of the United Nations institutions responsible for environmental and development issues, in particular the establishment of a Council for the World Economy, Environment and Development alongside the Security Council
Alliance 90/The Greens also want to improve international jurisdiction and the monitoring of international agreements
These include, for example, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, under whose jurisdiction compliance with international environmental agreements should be reviewed
Debt forgiven and the
Reform international financial institutions
The debt of the developing countries amounted to more than 2000 billion US dollars in 1996
For only a few countries has the debt situation improved
For the poorest countries, the crisis worsened in the 1990s For
this reason, we advocate bilateral and multilateral debt cancellation, especially for the poorest developing countries
Alliance 90/The Greens support the "Cancellation Year 2000" campaign of numerous NGOs, which aims at far-reaching debt relief, especially for the poorest developing countries
criticism of the IMF and the World Bank and the failures of conventional structural adjustment policies have also led to rethinking processes and tentative reform debates within these financial institutions
Alliance 90/The Greens support a consistent reform and democratization of the international financial institutions and the WTO with the aim of reshaping their policies ecologically and socially,
expanding the participation rights of NGOs,
and increasing public control and transparency.
Global solidarity policy must start with us
A foreign, financial, economic, agricultural and trade policy that is compatible with the environment and development is the most important prerequisite for sustainable development in both the North and the South
NGOs play an important role in the implementation of such a policy
This is why Alliance 90/The Greens are calling for better, unbureaucratic support and institutional funding for non-governmental North-South initiatives and groups
Development policy must start on the ground
In the spirit of the Rio Conference, all local authorities should adopt a local Agenda 21, which sets out the measures that can be used to implement environmentally and developmentally compatible policies locally
The federal government should actively support the municipalities in this project
Our long-term goal is a global economic policy that equalizes the living opportunities of all peoples at the highest possible level while respecting the ecological resilience of the globe
Green is the change
