Program of the PDS for the 1998 Bundestag Election
For the change of political direction
Social and solidarity - for a just republic
The time is ripe
Over the past decade and a half, Germany's problems have become increasingly acute
More than seven million unemployed, tens of thousands of missing apprenticeships, millions of people in insecure employment, severely damaged pension and health insurance schemes, desolate public budgets, a deep divide between East and West Germany, between people with and without a German passport - this is the result of the Kohl government
Social reality has moved far away from the demands of the Basic Law
The opportunity for comprehensive social renewal in East and West, which the upheaval of 1989/90 had opened up, was knowingly squandered
Neither a higher power nor the accession of the GDR to the FRG led to this misery, but the neoliberal policies of the CDU/CSU and FDP
Their government power must be ended
A future worth living needs a social, ecological, economic and spiritual renewal of society
This is what the PDS stands for
It wants a fundamental policy change, not just a different government
It is consistent opposition to the prevailing neoliberalism
The PDS opposes conservative politics in parliament and outside parliament and is committed to alternatives
The PDS is the socialist party of the Federal Republic of Germany
It adopts radical democratic and anti-capitalist positions in social and political disputes
The PDS regards the dominance of capital and profit orientation in society as the decisive cause of the social and global crises
Human survival, a social, ecological and cultural perspective imperatively demand far-reaching social change
It is essential to push back the dominance of capital over social development
Our goal remains democratic socialism - a society in which the free development of the individual has become the condition for the free development of all
The policies of the Kohl government have created absurd conditions:
Rising labor productivity is increasing wealth in today's society to an unprecedented extent
At the same time, poverty, injustice, mass unemployment and exclusion are on the rise
The social situation is worsening alarmingly
But those in power continue to focus on privatization and deregulation,
to the unleashed workings of the market, where social coldness and ecological blindness prevail,
and dismantle democracy
A change in these conditions requires democratic creative power and an influential social resistance and reform movement
Rationalization is taking place everywhere in society
But society as a whole is becoming increasingly irrational
This kind of rationality and effectiveness comes at the expense of citizens
In view of the huge unresolved problems, the governing parties are calling for urgent reforms
But they mean the reversal of the once hard-won social and democratic compromises
They turn the idea of reform into its opposite
This country needs alternatives that really deserve the name
This is why Germany needs the PDS in the Bundestag
Without social resistance, without pressure from the left, the SPD and the Greens will not resist the temptation to conform
There is no other party in the German Bundestag that opposes the government so resolutely and stands up for a democratic
and socially just republic
The PDS is the party that has been representing East German interests with consistency and competence for years, thereby also pushing other parties to do so
Every disadvantage faced by East Germans that has been discussed in the Bundestag has been raised by the PDS
Occasionally others followed suit, for example the SPD against the criminal law on pensions, which it had initially helped to pass
In the event of conflict, only the PDS can be relied upon with regard to East German interests
Without the PDS, East Germany will no longer be a political player in the Bundestag
The social crisis in Germany is closely linked to the country's ongoing political, economic and social division
Crisis comes from the Greek and means turning point
In this respect, one explanation for our competence is obvious: the PDS, which is still heavily dominated by East Germany, is the only party in Germany with recent and mature experience of reunification
Their supporters can compare the advantages and disadvantages of two social systems from their own experience and want to renew the demands of the democratic upheaval of 1989/90
This enables them to make the experience of failure productive and help prevent future failure
Many of the problems in East Germany are just the exacerbated difficulties of the country as a whole
This must be seen as a challenge for society as a whole
A self-confident representation of East German interests is necessary for the existence of democracy
No awakening in the West without an awakening in the East
The PDS is - verifiable by its practical communal work in the new federal states - to a special degree a party of social justice
and social solidarity
Voting for them means voting for a change of policy and consistently deciding against a government that is trying to consolidate the state budget at the expense of the sick, the weak and the elderly, against a government that is abolishing wealth tax while cutting social welfare, that wants to reduce the top tax rate and increase health insurance contributions, that redistributes social wealth to the benefit of large companies and top earners
The alternative goals of the Party of Democratic Socialism are: - We do not want to resign ourselves to the prevailing market radicalism,
we want the economy and society to be shaped democratically
- We want a new kind of full employment, a living wage for all, future-oriented and ecologically responsible
- We want social justice and the defense and reorganization of solidarity-based security systems,
We want basic social security for all
- We want future opportunities and a self-determined say for the younger generation,
new, contemporary education,
Modern and open universities
and the constitutional right to education
- We want the ecological turnaround to finally be initiated
- We want to work consistently to overcome social misogyny and achieve real equality between women and men
- We want those affected to be able to decide on their own affairs and to experience democracy to the full
- We want equal rights for all people living in the Federal Republic of Germany
The fundamental right to asylum must be restored
and a resolute fight against racism, nationalism and right-wing extremism must be waged
We want a democratic European Union
and the civil shaping of international relations
- We want to represent these goals nationwide, in both East and West
They also determine our special responsibility in East Germany, not as a regional, but as a socialist party of the Federal Republic of Germany
We have the chance. Let us use it
The PDS wants neither a new nor a "more compatible" version of Bonn's previous policy
It is committed to a society in which the weak are no longer weak, individuals are no longer alone, strangers are no longer strangers and addicts are no longer defenceless
The fight against mass unemployment is at the heart of our work,
Social cutbacks
and overexploitation of nature
We - the PDS and its voters - have it in our hands to put real alternatives on the agenda of social discussion
Every vote for the PDS is a vote for real political change
The PDS must enter the German Bundestag, state parliaments and local councils in 1998 and the European Parliament in 1999, strengthened as a parliamentary group
1. work and social justice
There is nothing more lacking in Germany than jobs that provide a living wage
and social justice
This situation is not the result of the much-vaunted economic globalization, but of the neoliberal policies of the German government
It has changed Germany dramatically over the last decade and a half, especially since 1990
The welfare state reforms pushed through by the labor movement and parts of the middle classes - also under the influence of the challenge posed by the GDR - are at risk
The policies of the CDU/CSU and FDP are characterized by social coldness,
by disregarding the social state and democratic design requirements of the Basic Law
and by capitulating to the future issues of necessary social change
Deregulation and the unleashed rule of the market have considerably restricted the possibilities of social and ecological orientation of the economy through democratic politics
In the Federal Republic of Germany - as in most capitalist metropolises - politics has degenerated into the vicarious agent of economic profit interests
In its political practice in the federal states, especially in East Germany, and in the Bundesrat, as well as in its economic policy strategy at the party conference in Hanover in 1997, the SPD adopted key positions of the prevailing neoliberalism (the German model, flexibilization of labour markets, dismantling of state regulation, privatization of public areas, creation of a low-wage sector)
Despite assurances to the contrary, it has also returned to the historically outdated positions of primarily quantitative economic growth
In contrast, we believe that a fundamental alternative is not only necessary, but also possible and realistic
The old answers are no longer sufficient in the face of fundamentally changed economic, social and cultural conditions, in view of the irrefutable need to stop the continued destruction of the natural foundations of existence and to finally initiate an ecological turnaround
However, the neoliberal responses of the governing coalition and the employers' associations, for whom the direction represented by Gerhard Schr√∂der in the SPD makes too many concessions, run counter to this necessity
They expose people to the full force of world market mechanisms instead of creating new counterbalances and framework conditions based on solidarity and environmental protection
In contrast, the PDS wants to contribute to a change from the domination of the economy over politics and society to the acquisition of the ability to shape democracy through truly alternative policies
Strong trade unions and company interest groups are particularly important for this
The PDS is committed to establishing a political right to strike - as in France
The creeping privatization and commercialization of more and more areas of society must be stopped
Health, pensions, education, culture, basic research, information, housing, energy supply and transport must be freed from the dominance of the market and commercialization
With no illusions about current feasibility, we will work to reduce the influence of banks on companies and public institutions,
the influence of democratic institutions on the banks is significantly strengthened
The European Union must be social,
democratic,
employment-oriented,
ecological,
peacemaking
and become cosmopolitan
We do not claim to have ready-made answers
We know how complicated and contradictory a realistic alternative will be
We are ready for dialog, debate, joint reflection, learning in practical politics and consideration of the views of our potential political partners
We base our economic and social policy positions and cooperation with other political forces on five guiding principles, which should determine the concrete steps and direction of future economic and social policy:
- A living wage is needed
Meaningful work that secures a decent existence for all is a prerequisite for a self-determined life and one of the most important social human rights
It is possible Society is
not running out of work, but gainful employment tied to capital exploitation is becoming scarcer
Changes must happen, changes can happen immediately
- Social injustice must be overcome
Social justice should be the basis for all economic, social and financial policy decisions
, and redistribution from the bottom to the top should be ended
Redistribution from the top to the bottom is not an anachronism, as portrayed by the government and even parts of the SPD and the Greens, but an urgent task for the future
We want to participate in defending the social security systems and expanding them on new foundations, instead of dismantling them under the banner of Seehofer's and Bl√ºm's "reforms
- The socially acceptable ecological restructuring of the economy and society must finally begin and open up sustainable development for the future.
An energy and transport turnaround and solidarity with the countries of the South and East are indispensable basic elements of sustainable economic development
An energetic innovation, science, research and technology policy as well as instruments in conformity with the market, such as the ecological tax reform, should promote them,
but the survival crisis of the natural environment requires above all greater regulation and the ability to shape society and politics
PDS will therefore also resist the SPD and the Greens, where they adapt to the dictates of the world markets, contrary to their own environmental policy goals
The financial overtaxing of wage earners and the exclusion of the weaker with ecological justifications is not only decisively rejected by the PDS, but is considered a serious obstacle to an effective policy of ecological change
- Real gender equality must become an overarching principle of a new economic and social policy
We are not prepared to accept the displacement of women from the labor market and their social and political disadvantage
Women have a right to gainful employment that secures their livelihood
Economic independence and a fair distribution of paid and unpaid work between men and women are prerequisites for equal participation in social life
- The future opportunities of the younger generations must be restored
Anyone who makes savings and cuts in this area is behaving in an anti-social and anti-future-oriented manner
We are concerned with young people's opportunities for social participation,
access to culture, sport and self-determined communication,
to provide modern training and jobs for all
and for a modern education and higher education system in line with the dramatic challenges facing society
We want to bring these approaches to bear beyond national borders for a democratic, economic, social and ecological management of globalization processes and European integration
We are striving for broad alliances to achieve this
We are and remain willing to cooperate with other parties, trade unions, associations and citizens' initiatives as well as churches and their institutions
All the challenges facing a new economic and social policy are concentrated in three urgent tasks: combating mass unemployment,
in the defense and restructuring of social security systems,
in the ecological-social reform of the tax and financial system
Resolving these issues will require special efforts in eastern Germany
This is also a challenge of social proportions
First: Jobs are places to live
Mass unemployment has taken on a chronic character in the industrial metropolitan areas since the mid-seventies
It deprives millions of people of the chance to participate in social life and destroys social integration
It is the most dangerous social explosive for society and undermines its democratic foundations
The federal government and the employers' associations not only have no alternatives to mass unemployment, but are also using it to pursue a policy of de-solidarization, the dismantling of the welfare state, the privatization of social security, wage and social dumping and the refusal of ecological restructuring
Without overcoming mass unemployment, without a policy of new full employment, there will be neither a return to the principles of the welfare state nor a transition to sustainable development and a future worth living in
The PDS has presented future-oriented alternatives in the parliaments and at its party conferences, which are already realistic and financially feasible under today's conditions, if the political will were there
We are not resigned to mass unemployment
We are telling voters that we do not believe a short-term and conflict-free solution to this task is possible
It will also demand cooperation between the broadest social and political forces and priority for employment policy in the European Union as well
We are ready for this without prejudice
We see the main ways to reduce mass unemployment:
- the focus of economic and structural policy on securing employment,
- the fair distribution of work between the employed and the unemployed,
between men and women by reducing working hours without reducing purchasing power,
- the creation of a publicly funded employment sector
Employment-oriented economic and structural policy
The PDS sticks to its demand for the right to work
We want the Basic Law to include the right to an apprenticeship and for this right to be realized in society
The Federal Government's practice of separating labor market policy from economic and structural policy is counterproductive in terms of economic policy
Structural policy and economic development must be innovation-oriented,
the creation and preservation of jobs,
strengthening regional structures
and support the ecological restructuring of the economy.
We advocate the humanization of the world of work primarily under trade union control
We regard the Employment Promotion Act, which has been in force since 1997, as a political scandal for the unemployed - especially women
The PDS demands its fundamental revision
We are against state support for a low-wage sector
Unemployment benefits and the conditions for further training and job creation measures must be improved,
the reasonableness rules are designed to be fair to parents and women
The PDS supports the right of the unemployed to reject employment relationships that are not subject to social security contributions or collective agreements
The preservation, renewal and expansion of trade union rights and co-determination opportunities
as well as safeguarding collective bargaining autonomy and the sectoral collective agreement must be part of a new economic policy
We therefore demand that, when awarding public sector contracts, preference be given to companies based in the region that are bound by collective agreements and that in turn work exclusively with subcontractors that are bound by or paid in accordance with collective agreements
The privatization of railroads, postal services and telecoms by the governing parties, the SPD and the Greens, as well as the planned further privatization of public services, are part of a policy that sacrifices jobs, social justice and ecological alternatives to international cut-throat competition
The Party of Democratic Socialism will not only reject this market radicalism, but will stand up for the strengthening of public, communal and cooperative ownership
We are replacing the privileged treatment of large banks and corporations with training and employment-oriented support for small and medium-sized enterprises
The future of agriculture and forestry cannot be secured through global market orientation, lower producer prices and compensation payments
The PDS advocates a regionally oriented development policy that involves the people of rural regions in decision-making processes about their future, takes account of the diversity of living conditions in rural areas, preserves and promotes the cultural landscapes that have developed over time, is based on the principle of sustainability and is unbureaucratic
We want to maintain comprehensive land management and thus create jobs
Offers for meaningful leisure activities for people in rural areas are to be expanded
Transfer payments to agriculture must be more closely linked to environmental benefits so that environmentally friendly production systems can emerge
Agricultural and forestry land in nature conservation areas must not be privatized
An immediate program to create apprenticeships is urgently needed,
A modern reform of vocational training
and training funding through nationwide pay-as-you-go financing
Distribute work more fairly
The federal government, employers' associations and even "red-green" state governments have pushed through the extension of the working week and working life
But without a fair distribution of the available gainful employment, i.e. without a significant reduction in working hours, ways out of mass unemployment remain blocked
Reducing working hours is also an opportunity for the wealth of human life and for overcoming the gender-specific division of labor in families
We support the trade unions in their efforts to reduce working hours and bring collectively agreed working hours in the East into line with those in the West
We want employees to have greater influence on the organization of working time,
socially and health-damaging working time regulations (such as increasing weekend and night work) and overtime are reduced
At the same time, we are advocating a new Working Hours Act that will significantly reduce the maximum weekly working hours
The statutory standard working hours could be limited to 7 hours per day for 5 working days per week
As part of a genuine pension reform, working life must be reduced at the same time,
the retirement age for shift workers reduced to 55 years
and a legal safeguarding of partial retirement in such a way that all employees have an individual legal entitlement to reduce their weekly working hours from the age of 55 at the latest while being guaranteed a living wage
We support the trade unions in their demands for collective rather than just individual reductions in working hours
The social conditions for reconciling work, family, raising children, caring for relatives, education, further training, social relationships and culture must be improved - not least through extended opportunities for paid time off work
All working time models should be designed to facilitate women's access to qualified jobs
When awarding public contracts and subsidies, priority should be given to maintaining and creating jobs for women
The statutory employment quota for people with disabilities must - as a minimum () - be enforced in real terms
Part-time jobs must not lead to poverty in old age; they must be enshrined in social law and opportunities to return to full-time work must be secured
The reduction in working hours must not lead to a reduction in mass purchasing power or to income cuts
Degressive state wage subsidies to companies with initial or temporary economic difficulties can promote such a process
Wages are to be more closely linked to the development of productivity again
Create a publicly supported employment sector
In a society like the Federal Republic of Germany, where ecological damage of at least 200 billion DM is left to future generations every year, there is a huge social need for work
The same applies to many other areas
Social, cultural and broad-based sporting commitment are essential for modern societies
Nevertheless, the federal and state governments are implementing financial cuts in the paid cultural and social sectors in order to reduce current budget shortfalls
They are thus saving on the future of society
The Party of Democratic Socialism, on the other hand, advocates a strong, publicly funded employment sector, particularly in socio-cultural services and ecological restructuring
It is about meaningful work that secures a livelihood, about work that is indispensable to society
It is also about the development of new forms of common property
The East German experience with employment companies can provide initial starting points and be used as examples for local solutions
Cooperative and municipal enterprises, social, ecological, cultural, feminist, educational and other initiatives, self-help and neighborhood projects as well as charities can become sponsors of a structure of non-profit projects
Their legal and financial framework conditions must be strengthened
To finance such an employment sector, we propose the creation of a federally structured and democratically administered fund for social, ecological and cultural community tasks
It could be financed up to 85 percent from the gradual elimination of unemployment costs
Second: Social security, social solidarity
In federal government policy, one "reform" follows another: The first, second, third healthcare reform, the Employment Promotion Reform Act, the pension reform, the attempted "historic" tax reform
What they have in common is the destruction of the welfare state reforms of the past, the destruction of social security
Healthcare and preventive healthcare that is independent of income and financial circumstances is at risk and has long been restricted
The future pension level has been drastically reduced,
Social protection against unemployment and poverty has been reduced,
social orientation on the housing market is to be effectively eliminated
Chronic mass unemployment, the increase in unprotected (uninsured) employment relationships and stagnating earned income have inevitably jeopardized the financing of the social security system
The real cause and the main obstacle to overcoming this threatening social crisis is therefore the neoliberal renunciation of an active and innovation-oriented labor market and economic policy
By promoting millions of precarious jobs without compulsory insurance - and therefore without protection in old age, illness, long-term care and unemployment - the government is further exacerbating the dramatic situation
We have ideas for a financing reform of the social security systems:
1. company shares, i.e. non-wage labor costs, should no longer be levied solely on the basis of the wage bill, but primarily as a function of gross value added
Companies with high labor costs would be relieved
Companies that make large profits through rationalization and burden society with the redundancies can and should pay higher contributions
2. the contribution assessment ceiling is to be increased, so that higher incomes will be more strongly involved in solidarity-based financing, especially of benefits in the event of illness
3. compulsory insurance must be extended to civil servants, the self-employed, members of parliament, etc., so that the contributions of higher earners strengthen the possibilities of solidarity-based equalization
Civil servants and the self-employed with low incomes are to receive compensation
4. if compulsory social insurance is introduced for "marginal employment relationships", the total contribution should be made by the employer - for social reasons and to counteract the further replacement of normal employment relationships by low-paid and socially insecure jobs
The inclusion of "marginally employed persons" in compulsory social insurance must not lead to a reduction in the pension level
The pension formula based on the average amount of all contributions paid should therefore be amended accordingly
5. insofar as social insurance funds are or become obliged to provide benefits whose entitlement was not acquired through contributions, they must be guaranteed by law a federal subsidy that fully compensates for these benefits
In principle, however, a solidarity-based security system will not be possible without overcoming the social divide and reducing mass unemployment
The Party of Democratic Socialism wants to enable social security for all through decent basic social security and a self-reliant livelihood through work for all members of society
For a transitional period towards this far-reaching goal, we want solutions that eliminate the disenfranchisement and discrimination of all those people who are dependent on social income for their livelihoods
We have four key demands: securing and improving the living conditions of older people,
the solidarity-based renewal of the healthcare system,
the struggle for needs-based basic social security
and the provision of affordable and secure housing
Age must not make you poor
Old age can mean human wealth and must not mean material poverty
The decision to reduce the pension level must be reversed
Old-age poverty has already reached worrying levels, particularly among women
There is an urgent need to recognize the lifetime achievements of women by improving women's pension rights
Older citizens should be able to spend their twilight years in dignity and contribute their life experiences to society
An old-age pension that secures your standard of living is the basic requirement, but not everything
We call for the rapid elimination of poverty in old age through the introduction of basic income support, which should currently amount to DM 1425 per month
The pension and benefit injustices that still exist for former GDR citizens must be comprehensively eliminated
We are committed to preserving the community of solidarity of the insured and strengthening it politically and financially
In the debate on pension reform, the PDS is sticking to the system of a solidarity-based contribution
We will resolutely defend statutory pension insurance as the core of the solidarity-based generational contract
Tax subsidies can be used to finance a mixture of individual benefit entitlements and solidarity-based equalization of distribution ratios as well as flexible and voluntary early retirement schemes
Health must not be a commodity
Our goal remains healthcare for all, regardless of individual income and wealth
The commercialization and bureaucratization of the healthcare system must be stopped, and two-tier medicine must be prevented or eliminated
Prevention, health promotion and rehabilitation should once again be financed and guaranteed to a greater extent by the health insurance funds
Patient co-payments and deductibles are antisocial and unnecessary if resources are used effectively
Effective use of the funds is possible if the dominance of drug and device suppliers is restricted by a positive list, among other things.
as well as rational and cooperative forms of operation (polyclinics, health centers) are promoted
We demand an effective right of co-determination for insured persons in the self-governing bodies of the health insurance funds
We will work to ensure that the structural prevention of HIV and AIDS is comprehensively continued and that HIV and AIDS self-help projects are financially secured in the long term
No one should be socially insecure: For a basic social security
The preservation and reform of social security systems must and can go hand in hand with the fundamental renewal of social security through the introduction of means-tested basic security
It would represent real historical progress in this society
We have submitted concrete implementation and financing ideas for them in the Bundestag
Basic social security should enable all people who do not have a job that secures their livelihood to lead an independent, dignified life in a way that can be specifically designed in each case
In particular, unemployed people, pensioners, trainees, students and people with disabilities should become socially secure and independent as a result
For people with disabilities and the chronically ill who will never be able to work, there is an urgent need for compensation to ensure their livelihood
We also advocate that people excluded from the employment system should be offered employment and training opportunities
The entitlement of unemployed people to specific social work services should be enshrined in law
This includes social work for the unemployed as well as forms of self-help for the unemployed
We reject compulsory work and the degrading control of support payments
The police and judiciary must remain responsible for cases of fraud
There must be no atmosphere of denunciation or even an obligation to do so
Affordable and safe housing
Housing is one of the most important conditions for social security and human dignity
Housing should therefore be affordable for everyone, and housing should be secure
The consequences of such - actual - self-evidence are urgent and concrete
Homelessness and insecurity are an indictment of one of the richest societies and of the federal government's policy: housing benefit must be adjusted immediately so that the cost of housing is also socially acceptable for people on low and middle incomes
The privatization of municipal, cooperative and public housing stocks must be stopped
There is no other way to prevent such an elementary human right as the right to housing from being sacrificed to commerce
Social housing must be maintained and expanded, and owner-occupied, cooperative and communal housing ownership must be promoted on an equal footing
We will work to ensure that urban planning and housing construction promote the proximity of living, working and leisure
We believe it is necessary and fair to extend protection against dismissal for single parents, older people and people with disabilities
and to prohibit the eviction to the street, i.e. without the provision of alternative living space
The participation rights of tenants are to be strengthened
The PDS is sticking to its demand for a democratic and social reform of tenancy law and its simplification
It has submitted a comprehensive motion to the Bundestag on this issue
Millions of East Germans experience the devastating consequences of the "restitution before compensation" policy
Even after eight years of German reunification, many cases remain unsolved
The PDS is committed to clear, fair legal regulations
Among other things, arbitrarily selected cut-off dates must be removed from the property laws
Expulsion by means of paragraphs must be prevented, as must expulsion by means of financial levers
User fees for recreational land must be limited to an affordable level
Third: Steering and financing social and ecological transformation
More than half a decade has passed since the Rio de Janeiro Summit adopted Agenda 21, the ecological and development policy agenda for the 21st century
Local initiatives and social movements have begun to give these orientations publicity and political validity and to implement them in municipalities
In the policy of the German government, however, which had wholeheartedly endorsed Agenda 21, the past few years have become lost years in the defense against the worsening global crisis
Despite its existential urgency, the "agenda of the 21st century" has not yet been tackled
The next Bundestag must live up to its responsibility to use the turn of the century to initiate a social and ecological transformation of society
Two criteria are crucial for us: ecological restructuring and equal life chances
Social and ecological turnaround
The social and ecological turnaround must no longer be postponed
Preserving and restoring the natural foundations of life, without which today's children and their children will have no future, requires a radical reduction in the consumption of resources and the burden on nature
This will not be possible without profound and historically hardly comparable social upheavals in everyone's way of producing and living
The PDS will seek socially acceptable solutions in the battles over the way in which environmental problems are dealt with and will make its voice heard loud and clear
Above all, we are calling on the new federal government to provide a framework and funding programs for two radical changes - the energy transition and the transport transition: Transition to an energy economy based on energy saving and solar energy while reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and phasing out nuclear energy as quickly as possible
This is the only way to put an end to nuclear waste tourism and avoid the unnecessary and senseless transportation of radioactive material
Decentralized suppliers of renewable energies should be promoted through cost-covering prices, among other things.
and municipal utilities and combined heat and power generation are strengthened
We advocate traffic avoidance through economic regionalization, the proximity of living, working, shopping and recreational opportunities, the expansion of footpaths and cycle paths, as well as a heavy goods vehicle tax and a modal shift from road to rail and water
We want public transportation to be expanded, safe and attractive in every respect and affordable for all, instead of wasting public money on the Transrapid, new major airports, additional freeways and environmentally destructive major waterways
The PDS will campaign for a ban on the transportation of animals over long distances
State-of-the-art technologies are to be developed and used in the energy, transport and materials management sectors in order to meet sensible needs in an economical manner
Durable consumer goods, a packaging tax and the consistent implementation of the polluter pays principle should contribute to waste prevention
We demand comprehensive waste recycling through separation and processing
We reject waste export and general waste incineration
In organic farming, labor-intensive processes must be able to be financed
Within the framework of Local Agenda 21, we want to promote environmental policy from below by supporting and networking social and ecological projects.
Such steps towards social sustainability are feasible
We clearly state that social and ecological restructuring will only be possible through strong social counter-powers:
social resistance,
public-law control of the major banks and the Bundesbank,
company and trade union co-determination options,
Democratization of the media,
Separation of energy generation, transportation and distribution,
ecological tax reform,
Integrated traffic design
Distributing wealth fairly
Redistribution from the bottom to the top has reached scandalous proportions
During Helmut Kohl's time in office, private financial assets in the FRG alone tripled to over DM 5 trillion
Banks and large corporations make record profits
But the richest members of society have largely opted out of financing the public sector
It is high time to reverse the current distribution concept of redistribution from the bottom to the top, which increasingly relieves the rich of taxes and places an ever greater burden on the mass of citizens
For the PDS, redistribution from top to bottom means relieving the burden on the socially disadvantaged, the young generation, wage earners and local authorities
and to stimulate sustainable economic activity
With its resolution at the Schwerin party conference, the PDS has submitted proposals for a reform of the tax and contribution system
Their realization would help to effectively tackle and gradually solve society's most pressing challenges
In particular, we want: A one-off capital levy should be introduced for insurance companies and credit institutions
A wealth tax of 2 percent per year spread over 10 years is to be levied on larger private assets (financial assets, land and real estate assets and securities holdings)
An appropriate tax-free amount must ensure that small to average assets do not lead to this tax liability
Owner-occupied residential property and appropriate private pension provision are not included in the calculation basis
If the total net assets of private households exceed DM 2 million, the wealth tax will be increased to 3 percent per year
Taxation must be based on the taxpayer's ability to pay (income and assets)
The minimum subsistence level of DM 17,000 must be tax-free, the initial tax rate must be kept below 20 percent and the top tax rate of 53 percent must be maintained
Last but not least, our demands include a child benefit that is graduated according to age
and the new regulation of wealth and inheritance tax law
Effective measures against tax evasion and subsidy fraud are urgently needed
The social tax revenue must be redistributed in favour of the municipalities so that local self-government can be realized financially
Effective taxation of international capital movements and international currency transactions (Tobin tax) is necessary
An excise tax of 21 percent is to be levied on luxury goods, but only 7 percent on everyday goods, craft repair services and medicines, and 15 percent on all other goods as before
The increase in general VAT to 16 percent agreed by the CDU, CSU, FDP and SPD is to be reversed
The restructuring of the current tax and contribution system must lead to social justice, transparency and simplification, as well as promoting employment and the development of a new, sustainable model of reproduction and consumption
Taxation and other financial burdens on labor are to be reduced,
increase taxation on the consumption of natural resources and the impact on nature
In particular, this should stimulate innovative, future-oriented structural changes, especially energy savings and a shift towards renewable energy sources
The PDS will do everything in its power to ensure that low and middle incomes are compensated for the burden of eco-taxes and levies in other ways, through tax relief or compensation payments
The tax and duty system must be harmonized within the European Union in order to curb tax evasion and tax dumping
The distribution of life chances between women and men needs to be comprehensively corrected
This is not only about overcoming the fact that women in comparable occupational groups still earn around 30 percent less than men, but also about eliminating the other, diverse professional, social and legal disadvantages faced by women
We are in favor of the abolition of spousal splitting
Any resulting financial disadvantages for lower and middle income groups must be compensated for
In particular, we will not resign ourselves to the fact that not even 25 percent of women have a living wage, even though women in Germany perform two-thirds of the work required by society, including almost all of the child-rearing and care work
Fourth: Renewing the economic concept for eastern Germany
Since 1996, the modest catch-up process in East Germany has come to a halt despite all the transfers from West to East
Growth is even lower than in the old federal states
The new federal states are currently among the regions with the lowest economic dynamism in the European Union
Industrial investment fell by 8 percent in 1996 and by 4 percent in 1997
Real unemployment reaches almost 30 percent
Improvements on the one hand, gloomy prospects for a change in the basic situation on the other
For the first time in 1997, East Germans' fears about the future exceeded their hopes
The PDS is working for the development of an alternative economic and development concept for the new federal states:
The deindustrialization of East Germany has had dire economic, financial, social and cultural consequences
Quite a few of them threaten to take on an irreversible character
The life chances of many people have been destroyed or jeopardized
In order to make an alternative possible after all, we are calling for all existing and new instruments to be brought together in the framework programs "Socio-ecological restructuring of the new federal states": Infrastructure investments in the new federal states, the necessary federal funding programs to initiate an ecological energy and transport turnaround, the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, the use of EU funding, active labour market and employment policies, programs to strengthen the research and technology base, funding programs for organic farming and for the maintenance of cultural landscapes
The provision of funding should be directly linked to the creation of jobs.
and linked to the advancement of women
For such a program, the greater responsibility of the federal states and municipalities for structural policy models and development concepts is essential.
and strengthening the financial power of the eastern German states and municipalities is necessary
Eastern Germany requires a particularly intensive, active state structural and innovation policy, which must be directed towards employment-securing and environmentally-oriented reindustrialization
Economic development and legislation must develop and exploit the potential of East German small and medium-sized enterprises for the realization of regional development concepts
The reform of economic promotion itself must aim at a more effective and transparent bundling of all promotion potentials and the interlinking of economic and research promotion with regional economic, structural, employment and environmental policy
Building on the East German experience with cooperative ownership, especially in agriculture and housing, economic development should give equal opportunities to different forms of ownership: cooperative, municipal and state ownership, private ownership, public participation in private companies, non-profit and state-funded projects
The fact that people are affected by the secondary status of East Germany in the federal government's policy calls for greater involvement of the workforce
and more effective public influence on economic development
Maintaining and strengthening collective bargaining autonomy and collective agreements in the new federal states is of particular importance
We want to use the strength of the PDS in East Germany to fight for modern democratic development and other opportunities for citizen participation, in particular the expansion of plebiscitary democracy, local self-government, participation and information rights of citizens' initiatives
2. living self-determined - realizing more democracy
For a democratic and solidary community, equality and equal rights for all people are indispensable - regardless of gender, age, state of health, origin, skin color, religion, disabilities, sexual orientation and citizenship
Therefore, we want to encourage people to seize opportunities to develop their individuality, to act self-confidently and to defend their rights It is
important to resist social conditions under which people are degraded and humiliated
For a just and solidary society
Real equality between women and men
Real democracy is not possible without real equality between women and men
Formal equality, equal human rights, political and personal rights for women and men have not eliminated the unequal distribution of social opportunities between men and women
In all areas of life, women are discriminated against in different ways, making it difficult for them to develop their abilities in a self-determined way
An above-average number of women are affected by unemployment and unfair valuation and payment of work
This is particularly evident in the eastern German states
Two thirds of the unemployed are women
Increasing restrictions on social benefits lead to housing shortages, poverty and dependency, especially for single women and mothers
The PDS will work towards firstly achieving economic independence for women from men,
secondly, to eliminate laws and regulations that discriminate against women and
thirdly, to create material and non-material conditions to ensure that domestic, child-rearing and care work is shared fairly between women and men
Democratic socialists want women to play an equal role in shaping all areas of social life
This includes enshrining comprehensive women's rights in the Basic Law,
amend the equality laws at federal and state level,
Include equality and quota regulations in works agreements, collective agreements and the Works Constitution Act
and to expand the competencies of women's and equal opportunities officers
We stand by our demand for the deletion of ¬ß 218 without replacement
Violence against women must be consistently and publicly ostracized and firmly punished
Affected women and children need more legal protection, safe accommodation and a functioning network of support and advice centers
We oppose all legal and social discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and demand that conditions be created for the full and equal acceptance of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals in society
We want equal recognition of all living arrangements and cohabiting couples
Future opportunities for the young generation
Children and young people experience a social climate of paternalism and intolerance
They feel threatened by the destruction of the environment
and increase in violence in society
Injustice and the lack of a vision for the future increase the feeling of resignation and alienation
Over one million children are already living on social welfare, which significantly impairs their future prospects
As a result of neoliberal policies, the lack of training places, high youth unemployment and the closure of youth recreation centers are exacerbating the situation
Children should grow up self-confident and free of violence
Young people must experience that their questions, ideas and visions are taken seriously and that their active participation and co-determination are wanted
We demand: firstly, to noticeably expand the opportunities for self-confident political action by children and young people,
secondly, to ensure future-oriented education and training
and create enough jobs for young people,
thirdly, to give more opportunities to the ideals of a just, solidary and alternative way of life and
fourthly, to secure the funding and promotion of work with children and young people as stable, indispensable parameters, irrespective of the annual budget negotiations
School, vocational and artistic training and opportunities to take part in sporting activities must be guaranteed for every young person and financial support must be provided regardless of parental status
We want young people to be able to make policy themselves, contribute their views and consciously represent their interests
The voting age is to be lowered to 16 at all levels
Children and young people need direct opportunities to participate in representative bodies, councils and committees
We support children's and youth parliaments with real participation rights, youth initiatives and alternative youth projects
Based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we are striving for an article on the fundamental rights of children and young people to be added to the Basic Law
We are committed to ensuring that the uniform nationwide Child and Youth Welfare Act, which regulates the involvement of children and young people in decision-making processes affecting them, is strictly enforced at all levels
At least 20 percent of the funds from the municipal youth welfare budget must be used directly for youth work
As an important step towards ensuring that children's rights are given more weight in politics and society, we are calling for the creation of posts for children's representatives at all political decision-making levels
We are also committed to ensuring that the specific needs of children and young people are taken into account in urban planning and that the spaces they want for activities and living are created
Young people need a variety of places where they can meet, communicate and actively spend their leisure time, which they can use free of charge and also design themselves
Self-determined lifestyles should be promoted
Wide-ranging social concepts can be used to counteract the spread of violence and intolerance in daycare centers, schools and other educational institutions more proactively
Children and young people must be able to learn to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence
The depiction of brutal violence, especially in the electronic media, must be restricted
We maintain that every child up to the age of 12 has a legal right to a place in a daycare center or after-school care center
All-day places make a particular contribution to realizing this principle
In all federal states, the amount of daycare fees should be based on the income of the parents/guardians and the number of children they have
Daycare and after-school care places should be free of charge for children of recipients of unemployment benefit and social assistance
Recognizing the life achievements of the older generations
The PDS is committed to a self-determined, materially secure and socially integrated life in old age
The rising cost of living, reduction in social benefits and pension injustice are having a significant impact on the quality of life of senior citizens
We want the life achievements of older generations to be respected and passed on to future generations
citizens should actively participate in politics, Environment, social affairs, culture and sports To
this end, appropriate framework conditions must be created
Senior citizens' meeting and recreation centers, senior citizens' offices and workshops should be maintained, additional ones should be created and the content of their offerings should be made more attractive
We support senior citizens' organizations, associations and initiatives that actively promote self-help, and advocate the extension of parliamentary rights for senior citizens' advisory councils and representations
The PDS is committed to affordable housing suitable for the elderly, protected against dismissal,
comprehensive health care
and a barrier-free public transport network
We note that older people in particular feel threatened by increasing crime and violence and withdraw from public life We
want to counteract this We want
political and social conditions, in which all citizens are protected from violence and criminal assaults
A network of information and counseling centers, social stations and services that meets the requirements must provide competent support and appropriate assistance services so that those affected can cope with their everyday lives and their individual crisis situations
Equal opportunities for people with disabilities
German society is currently a long way from enabling people with disabilities to lead a self-determined, largely independent and equal life
Achieving more independence, self-determination and democratic participation for people with disabilities requires, among other things, a more decisive stance against the arbitrariness of authorities and political disenfranchisement
and to promote more projects that give disabled people maximum independence and freedom
In particular, the exclusion from long-term care insurance benefits, the amendment of the Federal Social Assistance Act, the revision of the Employment Promotion Act and the changes in care and pension law restrict and prevent the equal participation of people with disabilities in the life of society
Impoverishment, fear and social isolation are the result for many people
The PDS bases its disability policy on the framework conditions for the creation of equal opportunities for people with disabilities (Standard Rules) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993
Our aim is to make living, working and living environments accessible to people with disabilities
This includes promoting the inclusive education and training of children and young people with disabilities
We support all activities to maintain and expand existing self-help structures and oppose efforts by the federal government to restrict self-help with the help of fiscal regulations
We are following developments in the implementation of the Long-Term Care Insurance Act with concern
Some improvements come at the cost of long-term deterioration for those affected
We see the adoption and implementation of a tax-financed care assistance law as a real alternative to this development
Equal rights for all - together against racism and exclusion
We are experiencing a societal climate of lack of solidarity and xenophobia
This encourages right-wing extremism, racism and the resurgence of anti-Semitism
With its campaign on "asylum and social abuse" and "foreigner crime", which was intensified especially during election campaigns, the Federal Government has contributed significantly to creating an atmosphere of hostility towards people without a German passport
The right to asylum has been largely abolished
Refugees and immigrants are denied basic civil rights
Criminal offenses and acts of violence motivated by racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are on the rise
Schools, universities, clubs, associations, public institutions and the German armed forces are reporting alarming facts on a daily basis
They are linked not least to the German government's discriminatory policy towards foreigners
Members of banned right-wing extremist organizations reunite in other right-wing structures
The Federal Republic of Germany is a country of immigration
Migrants are a permanent, integral part of this society
The PDS remains committed to the goal of a multicultural society, a coexistence of majority society and minorities based on equal rights, peace, solidarity and international understanding
We want to work together with progressive forces and in particular with the self-organizations of migrants so that decisions are not made over the heads of those affected
We demand a legal right to naturalization,
the possibility of dual citizenship
and the right to vote and stand for election for people who have lived in Germany for five years or more
The national character of German citizenship law must be eliminated
The PDS advocates that migrants and ethnic German repatriates should have the same access to education, training and the labor market as Germans who have grown up here
This includes the unbureaucratic recognition of school, training and university qualifications and comprehensive intercultural support measures
The PDS is committed to a comprehensive anti-discrimination and equality law
Norms that stipulate unequal treatment of Germans and immigrants must be removed from laws and ordinances at federal, state and municipal level
The introduction of a right of settlement is intended to give migrants an independent right of residence, irrespective of their spouse and the existence of the marriage
An overall concept for the integration of migrants is needed
Only on this basis is differentiated integration at federal, state and municipal level possible
No one flees their home country without need
People fleeing political, religious and sexual persecution, war, ecological and social disasters must also be able to find refuge in Germany
As one of the world's most important exporters and largest suppliers of arms to Third World countries - including and especially in crisis regions - Germany also bears responsibility for wars and social and ecological disasters that force people to flee their homes
Only a sustainable global economic order that distributes the world's wealth and social participation opportunities more fairly will help to combat the causes of flight
The PDS's migration and asylum policy is based on our understanding of democracy, humanity and human rights and pursues the following goals in particular: Firstly: Reception and help for people in need, therefore open borders for these people
Second: Elimination of discrimination against migrants and more differentiated measures for their integration
Thirdly, equal rights and equal legal certainty for people who have chosen to live in Germany
No person may be deported to countries where there is a risk to life, limb and mental integrity
Asylum is a human right
The fundamental right to asylum must be restored in accordance with the Geneva Refugee Convention
This means that not only state but also non-state persecution is recognized as relevant to asylum
Lack of protection against sexual violence and acts of violence against the physical and mental integrity of women and girls are reasons for flight that must be recognized
Persecution on grounds of sexual orientation is also one of the reasons for granting asylum
The current Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act, which humiliates refugees, is to be abolished
Receiving social welfare must not be a reason for deportation
Refugees must be housed in humane conditions
Refugee minors should be removed from the asylum procedure
They must be granted immediate right of residence and specific care
You need educational and vocational qualifications
Together with other democratic and anti-fascist forces, the PDS will continue to consistently resist right-wing developments, racism and anti-Semitism
The development of the broadest anti-fascist alliances is an urgent political concern of the PDS
We demand compensation for all victims of the Nazi regime in Germany and abroad who have been excluded from this up to now, including forced labourers, Roma and Sinti, homosexuals, victims of euthanasia and forced sterilization, the rehabilitation of Wehrmacht deserters and those convicted of subversion of military power, as well as the revocation of the remaining Nazi sentences
Companies that benefited materially from forced labor and the deployment of concentration camp prisoners must be held liable for compensation payments
Democratization of democracy
The result of one and a half decades of neo-conservative policies by business associations and the CDU/CSU/FDP coalition in the Federal Republic is also a deep political crisis
Many people no longer believe in the ability of politics to change social conditions for the better
Business organizations openly and ruthlessly dictate their goals and standards of political action
Power threatens to become uncontrollable
In this situation, there is an urgent need for public, democratic control and opportunities to shape the future
The Basic Law's requirement that the population should vote on a new constitution in the event of German unification has remained unfulfilled
East Germany is still legally a special area today
Eliminating the unequal treatment of East Germans is an essential prerequisite for preserving and consolidating the rule of law throughout Germany
The PDS continues to fight consistently against income and pension inequality, the eviction from homes and land, the reduction or cancellation of justified subsidies, penal pensions, occupational bans, political prosecution and the disregard and discrediting of East German biographies
We advocate a fair distribution of land and the preservation of the results of land reform
We vigorously condemn all attempts to reverse the land reform
The "Law on the Rights of Property Owners from the Land Reform of March 6, 1990" must be fully enforced
The PDS advocates the comprehensive realization of political and social human rights
All people should be able to participate self-confidently in shaping their living conditions and assume social and solidarity-based responsibility
The PDS wants a new democratization of society: Firstly, through the significantly expanded participation of citizens, especially those affected and their organizations
Secondly, through the decisive expansion of direct democracy
Thirdly, through the institutionalization of new counter-powers
Fourthly, by regaining or defending representative democracy and expanding its foundations
Fifth, through the expansion of economic democracy
The PDS develops and supports activities aimed at comprehensively guaranteeing the specific rights of the Sorbs, Danes, Frisians, Sinti and Roma living in Germany to protect, maintain and cultivate their national identity and to enshrine them in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany
The associations of national minorities shall be effectively involved in the preparation of decisions by the federal government, the state governments and in administrative and planning activities that affect their particular national interests
Extend plebiscitary democracy
There is an urgent need to strengthen plebiscitary democracy
Popular initiatives, referendums and plebiscites at all levels, from the municipalities to the state and federal levels to the European Union, should help to involve people in deciding their own affairs, mobilize them to take active political action and exert social pressure on those in political power
Low entry quorums and minimum four-month terms should apply to popular initiatives and referendums
The essence of fundamental rights, the rule of law and the welfare state as well as the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany must not be the subject of referendums
Extra-parliamentary movements, citizens' initiatives and those affected must already be actively and equally involved in the process of preparing decisions that affect them
Bodies such as round tables, social investigation commissions and others, in which conflicts of interest are resolved and consensus is sought, should be promoted, legally protected and given influence over decision-making bodies in parliaments, governments and administrations
Institutions and associations that are not profit-oriented should be given more control and information rights with regard to economic decisions and receive greater social attention
The right to petition must be expanded
The PDS advocates the adoption of a law on voluntary work
Strengthen local self-government
The consequences of neoliberal policies are particularly noticeable in the municipalities
The municipalities are burdened with increasing expenditure due to the transfer of federal and state tasks - despite empty coffers, especially in the social sector - and their scope for action is further restricted
The PDS is committed to ensuring that local authorities have more rights and real opportunities to regulate and shape public affairs on their own responsibility
The local self-government enshrined in the Basic Law is to be restored and consolidated through more rights of disposal over financial resources, extended powers and direct opportunities for shaping policy
Municipalities must be prevented from being bled dry financially
A fundamental reform of municipal financing is needed
Eastern German municipalities are suffering particularly from the cuts in funding
For this reason, they should once again receive a legally guaranteed investment lump sum from the federal government
Subsidies are to be distributed in such a way that they flow directly to the municipalities
The PDS is calling on the federal government to relieve local authorities of social welfare costs in order to maintain the cities' and municipalities' ability to act
A municipal-friendly amendment to the property regulations for eastern Germany is required to end the ongoing cold expropriation of eastern German municipalities and to significantly accelerate the allocation procedures
The PDS was the first and most consistent party in the German Bundestag to demand the complete takeover of the so-called old debts by the federal government as part of the inherited debt redemption fund
Our aim is to strengthen the representatives elected by citizens in their dealings with the administration
We want administrations to work in a citizen-oriented and transparent manner
Municipal area reforms should be carried out with the affected citizens and not against their will
Expanding the rights of the legislature and the opposition
The PDS calls for the defense and expansion of the rights of the legislature vis-√†-vis the executive
Committees in the parliaments should always meet in public
Popular initiatives should have the right to speak before parliaments and in committees
We want the establishment of a parliamentary chamber at federal level to represent social, ecological, feminist and other movements
The PDS wants to contribute to a significant improvement in parliamentary public relations work
Rights of initiative are to be extended in parliaments and question times for citizens are to be set up
The PDS advocates the establishment of ombudsmen in the German Bundestag and other parliaments, who are democratically elected and act as representatives of citizens' interests when their basic political and social rights are violated by the state or administrations
Members of the government should be elected or voted out of office by parliament
We want to enshrine the right of the opposition to greater participation in all constitutions
We are in favor of the committees responsible for the budget and petitions being chaired by the opposition
The right to ask questions, speak, submit motions and inspect files is linked to the mandate as a member of parliament
A political mandate is incompatible with a management consultancy mandate
At a time when parliamentary majorities are deciding on ever more serious cuts in social legislation, the PDS is speaking out against dietary increases
Double salaries and special privileges for ministers and state secretaries must be abolished
Members' secondary employment and income must be disclosed
Democratize the right to vote
We demand a democratization of the right to vote through the following additions: First: The right to vote is reduced to 16 years of age
Secondly, non-Germans who have had their permanent residence or habitual abode in the Federal Republic of Germany for five years or more are entitled to vote and stand for election
Thirdly, the 5% blocking clause will be lifted
Fourthly, voters are given the opportunity to mark up to three of their preferred candidates on a party's list in order to determine the order of candidates in the list election themselves
Fifth: So-called overhang mandates are to be compensated in such a way that the composition of the Bundestag corresponds to the result of the second votes for the parties
Sixth: Bundestag elections are linked to the decision of substantive issues (referendums)
The decisions taken are binding for the elected Bundestag
More democracy at the workplace, in companies and enterprises
The PDS considers employee co-determination and economic democracy to be one of the most important challenges of the present
This includes, in particular, the co-determination of works councils in economic matters
The PDS supports the trade unions in rejecting all attacks on fundamental social and civil rights
The deterioration of labor and social law must be reversed
This means: Expansion of protection against dismissal,
100 percent continued payment of wages in case of illness for all employees,
reintroduction of an early retirement scheme
and the bad weather allowance as
well as ¬ß 116 of the Labor Promotion Act in the version valid before 1996,
return to an active labor market policy
and to store closing regulations that are socially acceptable for the employees
The PDS advocates a ban on mass dismissals and lockouts The
protection of people against precarious employment and - as long as they exist - in precarious employment must be regulated
We want, that employees' rights of complaint and retention in the event of company violations of occupational health and safety regulations be expanded and that a right of association action be introduced for the trade unions
The Works Constitution Act and personnel representation laws should be reformed with the aim ofextending the co-determination of works and staff councils in the company as well as of individual employees at their workplace
The concept of employee and company must be specified in an amended Works Constitution Act in such a way that bogus self-employed and other new employment groups fall under the protection of the works councils
In connection with the development of a labor and social code, the individual rights of complaint of individual employees and the co-determination possibilities of store stewards and works councils are to be extended
The PDS wants to use its political influence for this purpose, toextend the rights of employees and trade unions in the direction of a democratization of the economic and corporate sector
We demand that economic, ecological and social councils or public supervisory boards with legally binding information claims and possibilities to influence corporate decisions be established It is a
matter of creating a democratic corporate constitution in which employees and their trade unions are granted more rights vis-√†-vis management and owners
Ensuring security - protecting fundamental rights
More and more people in Germany fear for their safety
The PDS takes these concerns about protection against criminal attacks seriously
At the same time, we oppose interference by the state in the personal sphere of citizens in violation of fundamental rights, precisely because we are aware of the policies of the SED, their disempowering character and their failure, and because we have learned from the mistakes of our history
We want to positively preserve the aspirations of GDR citizens during the reunification period
Social insecurity and injustice as well as social exclusion and jeopardized life prospects for young people form the social basis for growing crime
White-collar crime, tax evasion, corruption and large-scale fraud cost taxpayers billions every year
The best policy to combat crime is a good social policy
Above all, social and political means and methods must be used to push back social structures that generate violence
However, we recognize that the protection of life, health, privacy and personal property must be ensured not only by positive social, economic and educational measures, but also by police and legal means
However, we are resolutely opposed to a policy of "internal security" that relies unilaterally on police and criminal repression, fuels existing fears of growing crime, restricts fundamental rights, stigmatizes individual social groups as the main threat and tends towards a surveillance state
Such a policy threatens people's political freedoms and privacy
The PDS supports initiatives such as the "Kritische Polizistinnen und Polizisten", which oppose the misuse of the police as a substitute for politics
The PDS firmly condemns the abuse of the monopoly on the use of force by the state
It advocates the decriminalization of acts of passive resistance such as demonstrations, blockades, individual and collective insubordination and political strikes
Civil disobedience is an inalienable part of political culture
The PDS demands the withdrawal of the tightening of the criminal law on demonstrations,
wants the deletion of ¬ß 129a,
is against political activity bans for foreigners
and for the lifting of the PKK ban
If drugs are dispensed under medical supervision, drug trafficking, drug-related crime and drug prostitution can be effectively combated and addicts can be given the help they need at all times
The PDS supports the initiatives of a broad spectrum of professionals to decriminalize drug use
We support a ban on advertising for all drugs, including alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical products
We are in favour of democratizing criminal justice policy
Offenses involving minor property damage should be punished outside of criminal law
Civil compensation and victim-offender mediation can help those affected by crime in a more sustainable way
The criminal abuse of economic power (corruption, environmental crime, tax and investment fraud) must also be combated by expanding democratic control
The rights of the accused and defense counsel must not be impaired - even under the pretext of swift prosecution of criminal offenses
The penal system must be committed to a humane and liberal model
With its draft for comprehensive judicial reform, the PDS wants to overcome inefficient structures
and remove undemocratic obstacles in the organization of the judiciary
The PDS demands an end to political prosecution in East and West Germany,
Prosecution for espionage in the context of the systemic conflict between West and East
and the rehabilitation of all victims of the Cold War
Detention pending deportation must be abolished
The task of the police is to avert danger and prosecute crimes
The main focus is on combating violent crime, serious fraud and theft, economic and environmental crime
The PDS condemns police hunts for anti-fascists, anti-nuclear activists and homeless people
Barracked riot police and Federal Border Guard to be gradually dismantled
In view of growing crime, the police have a right to improved working conditions in terms of technology and personnel,
to de-bureaucratize their service
and social security,
but not to increased surveillance means and increasing armament
We are in favor of democratic police reform with the following goals, among others:
Ability to de-escalate and prevent,
Decentralization of the police,
Introduction of police commissioners with far-reaching powers to monitor police abuses and human rights violations,
Stronger parliamentary control of the police and private security services
The PDS welcomes citizens taking care of public safety issues and working together in prevention councils
The police should only have an advisory role in these bodies
The PDS rejects the introduction of auxiliary police forces and vigilante groups for fundamental reasons of constitutional and police law
The PDS is strictly opposed to the "Great Eavesdropping Attack" and will work to restore the fundamental right to inviolability of the home
Parliamentary and public scrutiny of the European police is indispensable
We therefore reject the idea that "Europol" employees should enjoy immunity
Secret services always operate on the edge or outside of legality, foment mistrust and consume enormous amounts of taxpayers' money
Secret services cannot be democratized
We call for their abolition
3. culture with future - future with culture
The deep cultural crisis in which society finds itself can be felt everywhere: schools with overcrowded classes, declining educational standards and increasing pressure to perform, increasing differentiation in schools, which makes access to higher education more difficult for children from socially weaker sections of the population, society's inability to guarantee all young people a training place
Culture is participation in social life and the basis for human emancipation and self-development
Fundamental cultural rights are human rights
Mass universities with minimal contact between students and lecturers, the economic pressure for the majority of students to work, organizational incrustations, de-scientificization and financial thinning out of universities, unemployment among graduates reduce the value and efficiency of studies
The state puts universities at the mercy of commercialization
The tendency to divide higher education into elite training and mass training geared towards the labor market is increasing significantly, especially in the new federal states
The closure of theaters and concert halls, the dissolution of artistic ensembles, increasingly unaffordable prices for encounters with sophisticated culture, a reduction in funding for public libraries, a lack of youth clubs and youth spaces are diminishing the opportunities for meaningful leisure time and marginalizing the humanistic impact of art and literature
Quite a few artists live in social anxiety that makes them dependent
The concentration and monopolization of the mass media is progressing
The market-based diversity of press products and television channels is becoming increasingly uniform, undermining the choice between different offerings
Fundamental reforms are required to ensure that all people have access to every form and level of education and training according to their wishes and abilities,
culture, information and the new media networks, free of social barriers
The management and internal organization of schools, universities and the mass media require profound democratization, as do decisions on the fundamental directions of scientific research
The PDS wants to initiate such reforms together with all those who have the same goal
Ensuring cultural self-determination
Securing people's cultural self-determination, including in areas that lie outside the narrow spectrum of fashions and zeitgeist, and preventing the dismantling of cultural infrastructure are cornerstones of the PDS's cultural policy
It promotes development, self-determination and cultural acceptance of different lifestyles
Independent sponsors and publicly funded cultural institutions are equal and equally important partners and should remain so
Museums and memorials reflect the way we deal with the past, which points to the way we deal with the future
We want local authorities to maintain and expand the range of libraries, adult education centers, spaces for amateur art, meeting places for communication and district festivals as important elements of civic cultural policy for all age groups and social classes
Cultural funding is to become a mandatory task for local authorities, for which they are to receive funding from the federal and state governments
We are in favor of including a lump sum for municipal cultural work in the municipal financing law - similar to the financing model for municipal theaters
The PDS proposes the establishment of a nationwide foundation whose task would be to promote the regional and supra-regional networking of cultural work
A cultural policy advocacy group should be established at federal level to counteract the unimaginative argumentation based on practical constraints
It is no longer acceptable for an entire industry to profit from public cultural services without paying anything for them
We propose to oblige the culture and entertainment industry to make financial contributions to public cultural education institutions, but are also prepared to include other proposals for refinancing public cultural expenditure
Creativity requires planning security for its framework conditions
Cultural institutions as a whole lack this, as do many employees in the cultural sector who are only employed on a short-term basis
This is where the publicly funded employment sector can provide the necessary long-term support
For artists in freelance employment, co-determination rights must be established by law,
guarantee social security in the event of unemployment, illness and old age
The position of authors vis-√†-vis publishers and the media must be significantly improved
For the new federal states, the PDS demands that the federal government take effective measures to ensure full compliance with Article 35 of the Unification Treaty, so that the cultural substance of the GDR is not further damaged
The promotion of sport should be a state objective in the Basic Law and all state constitutions
It is to be established as a mandatory task of the federal states and municipalities
In order to implement the sports promotion concepts and to ensure the provision of sports instruction, the municipalities require appropriate funding from the federal and state governments
We oppose the reduction in funding for the renovation of sports facilities, the closure of swimming pools and sports halls, the reduction in sports lessons and the profitable privatization of sports facilities
We are against the further commercialization of sport
Education is a human right
Education is a fundamental human right
The PDS calls for the right to education to be enshrined as a fundamental right in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and in all state constitutions, and for it to be established as an individual right
What is needed are legal regulations at federal and state level that guarantee a solid general education for all and ensure equal educational opportunities,
guarantee the right to initial vocational training,
enable lifelong learning for all,
commit to equalizing different social situations through special support
and grant schools unrestricted freedom of teaching and learning materials
We are in favor of lower class frequencies and
against the increase in teaching duties for teachers
We want an emancipatory, anti-patriarchal and anti-racist youth and education policy
Regular offers for multilingual education and mother-tongue teaching for children and young people of non-German origin are needed
as well as intercultural education and training for teachers and social workers
Education should help to break down existing role models within society and develop acceptance of all lifestyles
The PDS strives for a fundamental democratic school reform
We are in favor of preferential funding for public elementary school and comprehensive schools
Village elementary school to be retained
The opportunities for all-day attendance and care at school need to be expanded
The PDS is striving for a school that combines primary and secondary levels and, above all, responds more flexibly to different educational needs and inclinations
This school should offer all girls and boys the opportunity to acquire comprehensive knowledge and social skills from the first grade onwards
It is intended to guarantee a wide range of opportunities for further education, including the acquisition of the right to enter higher education
In our opinion, fair and balanced performance assessment of pupils without negative pressure to perform requires a reform of the weighting of grades and verbal performance assessment
The PDS advocates that pupils with disabilities and their legal guardians should be free to choose the type of care and school they attend
The conditions for integration must be created at all public schools where necessary
All facilities with special educational needs must be well staffed and equipped
The right to education includes the state's obligation to provide needs-based, stable and sustainable funding
We reject the commercialization of education
A democratic school includes the co-determination of all those involved
For this reason, parent and pupil councils and teachers' conferences must be given more and precisely defined legal powers
School conferences should consist of half pupils
Democratization also means introducing the principle of temporary eligibility in the education system and organizing management activities on a collegial basis
In the fight for such reforms, the PDS will resolutely oppose the lowering of educational standards, staff cuts and the red pencil policy
Promote science and research
With the results of their work, universities, science and research are shaping the life of society more comprehensively and profoundly than ever before
The financing of universities remains the responsibility and task of the federal and state governments; it must not be shifted to the "acquisition of third-party funds'' from industry, which would leave universities at the mercy of marketization
The PDS supports the students' protests against the privatization of education funding
Universities need sufficient, i.e. increased, funding so that the number of study places and the provision of academic staff, books and scientific equipment corresponds to the number of students
The PDS believes that democratic change is urgently needed at universities
It advocates equal opportunities for university members, at least quarter-parity representation on committees, in order to overcome the absolute majority of professors on university committees
It also calls for social groups (boards of trustees) to have control over the budget, structure, research and teaching without restricting the self-governing rights of elected university bodies
These boards of trustees are to be made up of equal numbers of representatives from all status groups at the universities and from trade unions, employers' associations, political parties and, for example, women's and environmental associations
In order to increase the proportion of women, further measures to promote women are necessary
These include quotas for women when filling junior positions
and in appointments, the expansion of the rights of women's and equal opportunities officers
The establishment of constituted student bodies with a political mandate, statutory, contribution and financial sovereignty is essential
We stand by the opening up of universities and free access to higher education
This results in our demand for parent-independent, needs-based student financing,
for extended access to higher education for people with vocational qualifications, for people with a vocational baccalaureate
The PDS rejects barriers to admission of any kind, in particular internal university selection procedures, discrimination against foreign students and tuition fees in any form
The rigid structure of the study and examination regulations prevents individual planning of the course of study
For this reason, the compulsory canon of study regulations should be reduced, interdisciplinary teaching and research approaches should be promoted and examinations that only ask for facts should be restricted
In line with the overall idea of higher education, we want universities of applied sciences and universities to be aligned with each other at the highest level
The first steps in this direction are the right to award doctorates and the research mandate for universities of applied sciences, the equality of degrees and the simplification of the transfer of studies from universities of applied sciences to universities and vice versa
In addition to high academic standards, every degree program should be practice-oriented
Research funding should be based on criteria that are geared towards increasing knowledge and benefits for the general public, in particular solving social and ecological problems
The contribution of the economic and social sciences is particularly important here
Armaments research at universities to be discontinued, ongoing research to be made public
Universities have a duty and should therefore be given the right, regulated by federal framework legislation, to participate effectively in the discussion on how to tackle key social problems
The PDS wants a reform of the encrusted personnel structure at universities
The position of the so-called Mittelbau must be reassessed
Above all, this includes breaking down personal dependencies and creating secure employment relationships
We propose that the status of civil servants be phased out
All employment relationships in the science sector must be regulated by collective agreements
We believe that a special program to promote research and technology in eastern Germany is essential
There is currently an unacceptable gap here, as almost two-thirds of the former scientific workforce has been "wound up'' and more than four-fifths of jobs in industrial research have been destroyed compared to 1989
From the information society to the informed society
Mass media, especially the new interactive media, offer the opportunity to promote social information and communication that serve to maintain and expand democracy
They bring about far-reaching social changes and new modes of production that raise many new questions
However, the subjugation of the media to the profit principle supplants their educational and cultural mission
Information degenerates into a commodity
We believe it is necessary to create and maintain public service providers in all media sectors
They are to be removed from the influence of large commercial enterprises
Public service media must not be further downsized and destroyed through the outsourcing of editorial and technical areas
The PDS advocates the tightening of anti-trust laws and the licensing of independent window programs in order to limit media power in favor of plurality and diversity
New, non-commercial providers, alternative print media, alternative television and radio projects require support
The PDS advocates a three-tier broadcasting system consisting of non-commercial, public service and commercial broadcasters
We do not consider the principle of public law to be outdated, but it is in need of reform
The influence of political parties and governments on fee-financed television and radio is to be reduced, while social organizations such as trade unions, social associations etc. are to be given a greater say and equal participation guaranteed for all
The internal democracy of public broadcasters is to be strengthened, among other things through editorial statutes
Bodies such as broadcasting and media councils should meet in public
We reject internal and external censorship as well as other interventions in journalistic rights
With the increase in the number of commercial television and radio stations, the demand for the limited number of rights, for example for sports and films, has risen and continues to rise
This will drive up prices and make broadcasting fees more expensive
On the other hand, broadcasting subscribers only appear to receive the offerings of commercial broadcasters free of charge
These companies are financed by advertising, the costs of which are added to the price of goods
For these reasons, the PDS considers a special tax on commercial advertising to be necessary in order to support advertising-free media
Dividing society into people with and people without access to the new media squanders the opportunities and increases the risks of these media
The PDS therefore demands, among other things, free access to the Internet, to personal e-mails, free terminals in schools, adult education centers, libraries and town halls
It advocates the right to encrypt information and thus protect it from unwanted access by third parties, similar to the secrecy of correspondence
4. for a sustainable and civilian organization of international relations
We live in a world whose fortunes are more closely intertwined than ever before
Responsible politics must therefore have a cosmopolitan character, must include international development processes in thought and action
The PDS is not prepared to retreat from the growing difficulties and from a zeitgeist that constantly invokes practical constraints and that causes more and more people and political forces to resign themselves to the enormous challenges of the 21st century and to give up their own positions and ideas of life by invoking an alleged realism
Firstly, decisive national and international efforts to avert a global ecological and social catastrophe cannot be postponed
Nowhere is the market- and power-obsessed deregulation policy of the North, the international corporations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) more destructive than in the South, and official "development policy" is often a trailblazer for it
The right of peoples in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe to independent, self-determined and alternative development opportunities must no longer be disregarded
Secondly, we see it as our duty to outlaw war and military violence,
complete disarmament
and to strive for a civil, joint guarantee of security
This includes the Federal Republic's commitment to the undivided realization of human and civil rights.
and to overcome the enormous social divisions
and threats to the Earth's natural environment
We stand by our rejection of NATO and oppose its expansion and focus on global military operations
Thirdly, we want equal cooperation between all European states and peoples, the creation of a system of cooperative structures
The fundamental democratization of the European Union, the promotion of transparent and democratic decision-making processes and the active involvement of citizens in policy-making processes are indispensable prerequisites for this
Here the PDS sees a decisive focus for actively influencing the European integration process
First: Alternatives to Global Neoliberalism
We see the internationalization of social life as a great opportunity to push back nationalism
and to develop the cultural and material wealth of the earth in a solidary order for all people
In contrast, however, the far advanced economic and above all financial globalization of a neoliberal nature is working against the democratization and civilization of international development
The sovereign equality of states and the self-determination of peoples are being undermined and subjected to the interests of global capital exploitation
This is a growing danger for the political and, in particular, democratic ability to shape these processes
Alternative politics can only be successful if the neo-conservative attack on the foundations of the welfare state and democracy in Germany and the European Union, which threatens to destroy the social cohesion of society and the global ecosphere, can be averted: with reference to the real, fierce competition on the world markets, globalization is elevated to the status of an inevitable compulsion to act
Securing the location requires increased competitive power, i.e. increasing the profits of large companies by constantly making new sacrifices of the working poor and socially disadvantaged and through international cut-throat competition
It is a myth that this is unavoidable and that the accumulated problems can only be solved by the self-regulating forces of the world markets
It is the hallmark of neoliberalism, legitimizing the social atrocities and ecological inaction of the governing coalition
There is no alternative to this policy at all
Answering the challenges of global threats
Above all, globalization challenges us to confront existential global dangers
The aim must be to reduce the global threat to the environment,
the underdevelopment of large parts of the world associated with underemployment, hunger, misery and environmental destruction,
Overcoming war and violence
We advocate the implementation in Germany of Agenda 21, adopted in Rio in 1992, which has so far been largely neglected, and a global economic order based on solidarity
We call for the international and European agreement of minimum social and ecological standards
They must be implemented in a complex process and designed for underdeveloped countries in such a way that their access to the world market is not further impaired and independent and alternative development opportunities are opened up
It is particularly urgent to overcome hunger and impoverishment in large parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America
A climate catastrophe must be prevented by radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other pollutants far beyond the results of the Kyoto negotiations in order to preserve biodiversity on earth
We see the prerequisites for this in particular in a consistent reorientation of previous development policy, which is no longer based on the principle of a "mechanical" repetition of the Western civilization model
The poorest countries are to receive comprehensive debt relief
The transfer of resources, which primarily takes place from the poor and poorest countries to the richest, must be reversed
We expect the next German government to take effective steps in this regard and to increase "development aid" to the promised 0.7 percent of gross national product
The criteria of the capitalist metropolises, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and the IMF must no longer apply to their use, but rather those of self-determined, independent, socially and ecologically shaped development
The customs and market barriers of the EU and the other economic powers of the North against the "developing countries" must be dismantled.
and their instruments for protection against global market radicalism are strengthened (preferential conditions for exports and independent import rules)
Sustainable economic orientation
Responsible international economic relations require, among other things, the consistent promotion of technological and social innovations
We want to integrate economic criteria (such as efficient value creation, marketability through high product quality) with ecological and social requirements and also use them to reduce the North-South polarization
Worldwide, a reorientation from predominantly labor-saving to predominantly energy- and resource-saving technologies and goods must be achieved (longevity, reusability, repairability and recyclability)
We are committed to preventive environmental technologies instead of aftercare to eliminate or reduce environmental damage
In order to stop the dangerous unleashing of speculative global financial and stock markets, we support the demand for the taxation of international currency and stock transactions (Tobin tax)
The funds available from such a tax should primarily be used for international development projects via the UN
Globalization through regionalization
"Think globally - act locally" is the alternative to pure global market expansion
Regional development concepts, developed with broad public participation, should open up opportunities and ways to expand regional and local economic structures and help to combine economic efficiency with high social and environmental standards in a citizen-oriented manner
The economy's stronger focus on domestic demand is particularly important in counteracting the race to cut wages and social benefits as an alleged prerequisite for successful global market expansion
Such structures are not aimed at an illusionary exit from a modern economy, but - sensibly combined with a sensible international division of labor - have real opportunities
Even large companies are dependent on territorial infrastructure, education and qualification potential, healthcare facilities, everyday services and, last but not least, cultural factors
Environmentally destructive long-distance transportation instead of exploiting local economic resources cannot be sustained in the long term
Its direct or indirect subsidization should be abolished
Employment policy and municipal democracy require the bundling of local and regional economic potential and its profiling
We see the development of a non-profit sector at regional level as an important opportunity to realize urgent, permanent non-profit tasks, to expand the human-oriented service sector in an environmentally friendly and employment-effective manner and to revitalize the value-adding economy by strengthening the regional domestic market
We advocate the promotion of a network of initiatives that implement a Local Agenda 21, aim to develop sustainable products and production processes by exploiting all regional and local potential and are suitable for developing democracy from below
Second: Demilitarization of foreign policy
Since 1990, the Federal Government and the Bundestag have made serious changes to the foreign, security and military policy of the Federal Republic of Germany without parliamentary resolutions or public debate on many important issues
At its core, this change is characterized by tendencies towards a new great power policy for Germany and a militarization of foreign policy
We do not accept this development
Instead, we want to give civil alternatives a stronger public voice and political recognition once again
The PDS is an anti-militarist and consistent anti-war party
It opposes all militaristic propaganda, the glorification of war, military violence and all forms of incitement of nations, nationalism and racism
For this reason, it also rejects public vows (swearing-in ceremonies) as a matter of principle
Associations that pursue nationalist goals and some of which still call in their statutes for a Germany within the borders of 1937 are to be deprived of all state subsidies for their activities
International military deployments of the Bundeswehr, its conversion into an international offensive force, new armaments projects such as the "Eurofighter" or the Franco-German military space programs, arms exports and military "development aid" (e.g. arms exports to NATO member Turkey), decisions on NATO enlargement and the expansion of the Western European Union (WEU) as the military arm of the EU will not receive any votes from the PDS in the 14th German Bundestag either
We demand the immediate withdrawal of the Bundeswehr from the Balkans
All nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable means of delivery are to be eliminated on German soil
NATO was and is a product of the Cold War
Instead of calling itself into question after 1990, it is now being built up as the "New NATO", a military alliance of the rich North for power-political control of the entire globe
We consider their dissolution in parallel with the expansion of collective and non-military security structures to be timely
We will work to ensure that the UN and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are designed as effective international and European security systems and are democratically reformed
Peace research and peace education in Germany as well as preventive conflict prevention must be fundamentally strengthened structurally and financially
We reject compulsory military service and other compulsory services
Their abolition can and should be part of a long-term, complete disarmament process
This process must be shaped step by step, taking into account social and ecological conversion requirements, without creating a professional army along the way
First of all, the aim is to quickly reduce the Bundeswehr to 150,000 soldiers (by abolishing compulsory military service and disbanding the rapid reaction forces),
the renunciation of offensive armaments and arms exports
and Germany's accession to a European nuclear-free zone
In this process, the population and members of the Bundeswehr will experience that there is no loss of security for the FRG and the international community, but rather a gain in economic, social, ecological and security terms
It is our firm conviction that society will come to realize that national armed forces are no longer necessary to guarantee the security of the Federal Republic of Germany
Such a policy is possible in terms of security policy
This earth needs them
Third: For a Democratic European Union
As a European socialist party, the PDS supports European integration and advocates it
We want a Europe that is peaceful, socially just, democratic and environmentally preserving, with openness to the world and open borders, a Europe without nationalism and xenophobia, which sees itself as part of this one world, feels responsible for it and shapes it together with the peoples and states of the other continents
All opportunities for a democratic European Social and Environmental Union must be seized
The Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam have worsened the conditions for this and brought no real progress in the necessary democratization of the European Union
EURO introduction undermines the welfare state
The European Monetary Union based on the Maastricht Treaty and the so-called Stability Pact is neither accompanied by a social union nor by an active European labor market policy
It means instead a one-sided orientation toward monetary stability and increased capital gains
The introduction of the euro, which is not linked to concrete commitments to increase employment levels and to safeguard social and ecological standards, entails the risk of constant social cuts and further job losses in the EU member states and drives their citizens into low-wage competition against each other
The creation of an overpowering European Central Bank without political or even democratic control,
the division of the European Union into members and non-members of the monetary union as well as the
increased isolation from countries outside the EU are further, for us weighty reasons to reject the EURO as it is envisaged
The intention associated with the EURO √† la Maastricht to cement German dominance in the EU shows that a change of political direction in Germany is extremely important for a reorientation of the Economic and Monetary Union towards employment, social security and sustainable development
Full employment and social justice in Europe
Europe needs a turnaround in EU policy
The PDS is committed to changing the treaty principle of "an open market economy with free competition" in favor of a social community mission of the EU
A new type of full employment and the preservation and further development of the European welfare state model - these are the main tasks in the further development of the European integration process
The economic and monetary union must be corrected in this sense and supplemented by an employment and social union
Europe needs a European employment strategy with verifiable convergence criteria and quantitative targets
It must focus on the task of securing employment and creating new, sustainable jobs geared to the ecological restructuring of society, which are covered by collective agreements and promote equal access for women and men
We advocate giving the EU treaty competence to manage social and employment issues through regulatory intervention in the market mechanism
It is imperative that the EU Member States make a binding commitment not to further reduce the current level of national social standards and jointly strive for a qualitatively higher level of social benefits
Economic, industrial, structural, financial and fiscal policy must be subordinated to labor market, employment and environmental policy
Harmonization of tax policy and tax law is therefore necessary at EU level, which in particular provides for the levying of a cross-border withholding tax on capital income and the introduction of a European eco-tax, as well as the elimination of tax havens and tax evasion
EU funds are to be reallocated in favor of employment-promoting measures and structural policy is to be opened up from this perspective
We want a public investment program in the EU that supports the ecological restructuring of transport systems and energy supply as well as the creation of trans-European information networks
A binding framework directive on reducing working hours should be adopted at European level
We are committed to standardizing and expanding employees' co-determination, information and protection rights
and a European framework law on labor and collective bargaining law and labor jurisdiction is developed
The strengthening of trade union rights is overdue
This includes an immediate contractual guarantee of the right to strike across borders
The democratization of the European Union
Developments in Europe require a fundamental democratization of the European Union, transparent and democratic decision-making processes in politics and business and the active participation of citizens
Since the Maastricht Treaty came into force, political and economic elites have been determining and shaping the process of European integration to an even greater extent, largely outside democratic control
The decision on the introduction of the euro, the forthcoming reforms to the EU's agricultural, structural and financial policies and the enlargement of the EU to the east and south will have a profound impact on the lives of people in Europe
It is therefore essential that they play an active role in shaping these processes
This first requires a democratization of all policy areas in the EU, a democratization of institutions and structures, including the guarantee of co-decision rights of the European Parliament, the strengthening of participation rights for national parliaments
An important step towards further European integration and its democratization can and should be the drafting and broad discussion of a European Constitution
It must be decided by referendum in the EU member states
Irrespective of this, we advocate the inclusion of a catalog of fundamental rights in the EU Treaty.
and the drafting of comprehensive anti-discrimination and equality legislation, because the fundamental individual and social rights of all people living in the EU can only be effectively protected and guaranteed if they are legally enforceable
We want citizens to have a direct say in shaping and making decisions, e.g. through referendums in all EU Member States on fundamental decisions on the structure of the EU
The opportunities for citizens' initiatives, trade unions and social forces to have a say, participate in shaping and co-decide must be expanded or, in many cases, implemented in the first place
The PDS demands the full implementation of direct parliamentary control of European police cooperation
The EU-wide fight against crime must also be committed to the protection of fundamental and human rights
The political union agreed in the Maastricht Treaty must have a civil, social and ecological content
As early as 1999, the European Parliament was to be elected according to a uniform proportional representation system without a blocking clause
We want an open Europe and will oppose all attempts to seal off the European Union from the South and East or to pursue power-political divisions with concepts of a "core Europe"
The democratic development of Europe includes the creation of equal opportunities for all states wishing to join the EU to be involved in the decision-making processes on their future membership from the outset
However, the enlargement of the EU presupposes the fundamental reform of the European Union itself
The Federal Republic of Germany needs a new policy
A policy of real change instead of half-hearted corrections
