I. Jobs for Germany
Germany needs an intellectual climate of new beginnings
Germany needs a mental climate of new beginnings, future orientation and a willingness to take risks and achieve
Creating this intellectual climate is a task for politics and society as a whole
The necessary reforms require everyone to be willing to change and to give up cherished possessions
The F.D.P is the political force that honestly addresses the necessary changes and rejects the competition of unaffordable political promises
The F.D.P. appeals to all forces, to all groups, to all people who shape social development in our country
Together, we want to see the opportunities, not the risks, in new developments and new technologies,
- be guided by courage and change, not by paralysis,
- Exude hope and optimism, not fear and worry
Germany needs market-based renewal for jobs
For jobs, Germany needs free-market renewal from head to toe
Citizens know that a little patchwork here and there is not enough when a huge state apparatus and a proliferating social bureaucracy eat up half and more of the middle income
If every second deutschmark passes through the hands of the state, then that is too much bureaucratic state economy and too little social market economy
Unemployment is a heavy fate
The most social policy is to create jobs
In Germany, there is no shortage of work, But there is a shortage of affordable jobs The
responsibility for preserving jobs and creating new jobs is not borne by the state alone, but by the collective bargaining partners, who largely determine the costs of the labor factor through wage costs and collectively agreed additional
wage costs The state bears responsibility for the tax burden and the high statutory additional wage costs Bureaucratic
procedures and overregulation also prevent more investment and drive jobs out of Germany
In 1998, it is a matter of deciding the direction: Is Germany driving offside on well-worn rails with the tax burden of the welfare state?
Or is Germany heading for a good future with a liberal welfare state?
The F.D.P. is the only party with the courage to renew the market economy:
to a social market economy instead of a bureaucratic state economy,
to fewer taxes and duties instead of more government spending,
to more personal freedom and responsibility instead of the nationalization of responsibility
SMEs in particular create more opportunities for good training and a secure job
It alone accounts for around 80 % of our current jobs
That is why SMEs, freelancers, craftsmen and the self-employed are the backbone of our economy
With the turn to market-based economic renewal after 1982, we liberals have proven what market-based reforms can achieve for more jobs
This created 3 million additional jobs in West Germany at the time
Today, the F.D.P. is once again the only party that wants to break up the rigidities of the welfare state through tax relief, tax honesty, tax fairness, fewer social security contributions and more independent provision for the citizens
Work for all is then no longer a utopia, but the reality of a social market economy that once again deserves its international name of honor
Germany has every chance of creating well-paid jobs
and a welfare state that becomes more reliable again
Because wherever Germans are not slowed down or even discouraged by a high tax burden, high social security contributions and bureaucratic rigidity, they are willing to perform, are flexible and innovative
Germany needs performance, flexibility and innovation
1.tax cut for jobs
Our goal for the coming legislative period is a thorough, market-based tax reform at the earliest possible date
In the age of globalization, tax reform is a key project for more investment
and workplaces
and also for healthy public finances
The problems of the 21st century cannot be solved with our antiquated tax system
The consequences: - Our tax system is unfair and unjust
It places a different burden on the same level of income
This is due to the numerous special tax regulations
These can hardly be used by many people
This is how the average taxpayer finances the tax concessions to mitigate the excessively high tax rates
- When they were introduced, tax subsidies were at best intended to achieve socially or economically desirable goals
In the meantime, however, they have gotten so out of hand that tax revenue has fallen far short of expectations in recent years
Tax revenues are no longer calculable
Many tax subsidies have even led to capital misallocation
- Our tax rates are inimically high
They penalize working citizens, innovation and saving
Tax concessions provide incentives to look for tax-saving opportunities of all kinds instead of concentrating creativity and hard work fully on markets and jobs: Energies are misdirected as a result
The high tax rates put our economy at a disadvantage in international competition
They promote the migration of companies and jobs abroad
The core of the tax reform demanded by the F.D.P. is a massive reduction in tax rates for citizens and businesses across all income brackets, combined with the extensive elimination of tax exemptions
The aim is to reduce the burden by at least DM 30 billion with more net income for all
This will make our tax law simpler, fairer and more performance-friendly
This strengthens our economy in international competition;
Jobs are secured, new jobs created
Despite the net relief sought by the F.D.P., this will result in additional tax revenue for the state:
Experience in other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, shows that such reforms lead to higher tax revenues because they stimulate growth and employment
The major tax reform of this legislative period failed due to resistance from the SPD in the Bundesrat
It would have fulfilled most of the demands of our 1994 Bundestag election program
Nevertheless, important parts of our demands have been implemented: - Tax exemption of the minimum subsistence level,
- Abolition of the coal penny without replacement,
- Increase in child benefit and child allowances,
- Abandon the levying of wealth tax, in particular the wealth tax on business assets, which is detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises,
- Abolition of business capital tax,
- Reorganization of inheritance and gift tax with SME-friendly components for the transfer of small and medium-sized enterprises,
- Reduction of the solidarity surcharge as a first step
These measures have brought relief of DM 37.5 billion
Our goals for the coming legislative period .1 A major tax reform with a graduated income tax rate
2. complete abolition of trade tax
3. consistent simplification and reorganization of tax law
Major tax reform with graduated tariff for fairer and lower taxes
- Reduction of rates for wage and income tax and corporate income tax,
while at the same time largely abolishing tax exemptions and tax subsidies The
goal remains a graduated tax rate: Tax rate zero for the income bracket up to currently approx. DM 13,000,
15% for the income bracket from over DM 13,000 to DM 20,000,
25% for the income bracket from over DM 20,000 to DM 60,000 ,
35% for the income bracket over DM 60,000
These income brackets apply to single persons
For married persons, the double amounts for the income brackets apply in each case
In the case of corporate income tax, the tax rate is to be 35% for retained profits and 25% for distributed profits
The tax rates for commercial income in the case of corporations and partnerships apply on condition, that the additional burden of trade tax is abolished
Otherwise, the rates for commercial income would have to be further reduced
- The solidarity surcharge should be abolished as part of a major tax reform without restricting transfer payments to the new federal states
Significant relief of at least DM 30 billion for taxpayers in the form of wage and income tax and corporate
income tax A fundamental tax reform will once again create reliable tax revenues and, through an economic revival, also more tax revenues for the state
- As part of the tax reduction reform, the F.D.P. advocates a third VAT rate on energy consumption if it is introduced uniformly throughout Europe, otherwise it will burden the economy and jobs in Germany alone
The F.D.P., however, makes it a condition for a third VAT rate on energy that the revenue from it is used exclusively for the simultaneous further reduction of the tax rates for wage and income tax as well as corporate income tax
- Further timely adjustment of the basic personal allowance
The subsistence minimum of every citizen must always be tax-free
- Change the taxation of retirement income: Full deduction of all pension contributions from wage and income tax and full taxation of pensions, insofar as the contributions made were previously deductible
Transitional arrangements are necessary for a longer period of time to make financing possible
- Replacement of the current capital-displacing and super-bureaucratic taxation of interest by a final withholding tax at 25%, for small incomes as an imputation tax
Abolition of trade income tax with compensation for municipalities
- The trade income tax should be abolished because it is a high special tax on companies that are supposed to create and maintain jobs
It is a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, which have little or no international scope for tax structuring
To compensate for this, the municipalities should receive a higher share of income tax and/or value-added tax;
as part of a financial reform, the municipalities should be able to exercise their own, limited right of assessment on their share of income tax
Consistent simplification and reorganization of tax law
- Consistent simplification of tax law by largely abolishing tax exemptions in income tax law
- Final abolition of the wealth tax, which is currently no longer levied,
also as a prerequisite for the final abolition of the bureaucratic standard valuation, After the abolition of wealth tax and the reorganization of inheritance tax, this will only be carried out for real estate tax
For real estate tax, a simple valuation based on actual or customary rent or on converted space for commercial buildings is sufficient
- Abolition of motor vehicle tax and transfer to mineral oil tax
- Instead of numerous individual laws, a tax code in which tax law is clearly summarized and thoroughly cleared out
For employees, the goal must be self-calculation of the annual tax
2. an end to subsidies
Germany's subsidy policy is unfair and distorts competition
This puts SMEs in particular at a disadvantage
Many billions are spent annually on preserving industries and products of the past at the expense of investment in education and training, Germany's most valuable location factors
The F.D.P. has ensured that coal subsidies will be cut from DM 9.25 billion to DM 5.5 billion by 2005 in a socially and regionally acceptable way
In addition, the F.D.P. advocates that, in the interests of planning security, it should be established at an early stage that coal subsidies will be phased out from 2005 onwards
In view of the overall scope of German and European subsidies, however, the discussion cannot be narrowed down to the subject of hard coal
A fundamental reform of subsidy policy is absolutely essential
This also applies with regard to the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, which has become increasingly opaque
In general, we want to grant subsidies only as temporary and degressive start-up and adjustment aid and reduce them to a fraction of their original amount
As long as the reduction of individual subsidies is politically blocked, the F.D.P. is aiming for a percentage reduction in subsidies (''lawnmower method'')
3. further targeted support for new federal states
The people in the new federal states are particularly willing to perform
This is demonstrated by countless start-ups and the development of a service culture on private initiative
However, the economy of the new federal states is still under strong pressure to adapt
East Germany therefore continues to need solidarity-based assistance
This use of public funds is particularly sensible
With regard to the various support instruments, the F.D.P emphasizes the investment allowance
The application procedure and the processing of subsidies must be made less bureaucratic, especially for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises
The willingness of start-ups to take risks must be matched by a greater willingness of investors to take risks
In addition, the measures introduced to improve payment practices must be implementedThe
collective bargaining parties must also make their contribution to the upswing in the East No
longer must wrong decisions in collective bargaining weaken the competitiveness of companies and produce new unemployment Collective bargaining
agreements must be based on productivity growth in companies
Only in this way can jobs be preserved
4. new offensive for privatization
We liberals maintain that it is not the task of the state to be entrepreneurial
The Post Office, Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bahn are just a few examples of the privatization successes of the German government to date
The federal government alone currently holds around 516 investments
The nominal capital amounts to over DM 32 billion, the actual fair value is considerably higher according to all experience
The F.D.P wants to sell the federal shareholdings within the next 5 years
The proceeds and interest savings are to be used specifically to reduce the federal budget's debt.
and used for an innovation and education initiative
State-owned real estate should also be reduced to the necessary minimum: The less the state plays entrepreneur and property owner, the better for sound public finances, the more can be invested from privatization profits in education, training and future technologies
Many federal states and municipalities still have considerable privatization backlogs here
Infrastructure tasks for which the state as an entrepreneur provides the services itself - for example utilities, waste disposal and transport routes - should also be increasingly transferred to private providers
This includes planning, financing, construction, maintenance and operation of the facilities
The public sector should limit itself to sovereign responsibility, in particular the determination of basic requirements
This new division of labour between citizens and the state means: full transfer of tasks to the private sector, no sham privatization and bogus self-employment at the expense of the middle class in particular
5. reduction of bureaucratic obstacles
Bureaucracy is a burden on citizens, jobs and businesses in Germany
The F.D.P. focuses on small and
medium-sized enterprises Small and medium-sized enterprises are among the most innovative and motivated, they are the engine of the German economy, they create the most training and jobs
The F.D..P will continue to work on reducing bureaucratic obstacles, the density of regulations and speeding up approval procedures The
goal is to reduce bureaucratic burdens by at least 20% within three years, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, freelancers and the self-employed
Furthermore, the public sector must reimburse companies for the costs of bureaucratic services that are provided exclusively in the interest of the public sector - compulsory statistics, compulsory statistics, payroll tax deductions, payment of child benefits, calculation and forwarding of social security contributions, issuance of earnings certificates for government agencies
Technically, this can be done easily by means of a flat-rate deduction from the payroll tax paid, graduated according to the size of the company
Furthermore, we need more flexibility in employment services
The monopoly of the Federal Labor Office must be abandoned in favor of a free and efficient employment service
6. courage for more competition
The F.D.P will consistently continue its policy of recent years
From the privatization of telecommunications and the energy industry to the postal service, the course is set for more competition
The F.D.P. also wants to extend competition to previously monopolistically encrusted service sectors and strengthen competition in telecommunications, post and rail transport
Unemployment is unbearably high because market economy principles have been perforated in practice: For new jobs, we need innovations to identify market opportunities
Competition is the way to discover new ideas, products and services
Competition forces structural adjustments
Jobs are being lost in individual areas during the adjustment process
On the other hand, competition brings lower prices, better quality, higher productivity, more innovation
This leads to dynamic growth and thus creates new, future-proof jobs
In order to unleash more competitive forces, the F.D.P. will campaign in the next legislative period for further liberalization of the Shop Closing Act, the Crafts Code, the Discount Act and the Bonus Ordinance
The F.D.P calls for consistent enforcement of competition principles at European level and to this end reiterates its call for an independent European competition authority
7. reform of collective agreements
The large-scale destruction of jobs and social opportunities caused by rigid, company-wide collective agreements must be stopped:
The regional collective agreement, which regulates employment relationships down to the last detail nationwide, has had its day
The "collective bargaining cartel" of employers' associations and trade unions takes too little account of those who are looking for work and of the specific situation of individual regions, sectors and companies
The legislator also promotes this development by the fact that, according to the current legal situation, temporary exceptions to the collective agreement "downwards" depend on the agreement of both parties to the collective agreement
The parties to the collective agreement should limit themselves to concluding framework agreements
Within the framework, the decision on pay and working hours in particular is shifted to the company level, to agreements between the company and the employees or the elected employee representatives
Only they, the partners in the individual company, know its economic situation and its special requirements
Only they can respond flexibly and individually
This new form of collective agreement must be legally secured by amending the Collective Agreement Act and the Works Constitution Act accordingly
The general applicability of collective agreements must be abolished
8. more flexibility in earned income
Creating new jobs, securing jobs and thus giving the unemployed a chance presupposes a phase of moderate wage agreements in which wage increases below productivity are agreed on a long-term basis in the interests of the unemployed
In difficult times, wage restraint is an investment in the future in the interests of secure and well-paid jobs
The F.D.P. rejects across-the-board reductions in working hours or a general 30-hour week because this would make jobs in Germany even more expensive
Future scope for income growth should be used specifically for a performance-related pay component: Employees are entitled to a certain share of profits, which increases as profits rise
This employee participation in economic success promotes partnership within the company
9. new impetus for wealth creation
Despite rising incomes, broadly diversified participation in productive assets has hardly developed at all in recent years
Future opportunities lie dormant here
Employee participation promotes employee motivation
They also channel and retain capital in companies, which can be used to create new jobs
Capital formation needs freedom and voluntariness: freedom of choice for employees in the type of investments and voluntariness of agreements in the companies, no privileging of tariff funds
We want to improve and expand the opportunities for broad-based wealth creation through investment wage models
For citizens who had fewer opportunities for private wealth accumulation in the former GDR, a bonus is to be provided as compensation for disadvantages
Insofar as parts of the income, in particular profit-related variable income components, are not paid out but invested, they remain exempt from taxes and social security contributions until they are paid out to the employee in cash at a later date
The F.D.P. also calls for the establishment of pension funds into which employers and employees can make payments
In addition to capital accumulation, they also serve to provide additional retirement provision on your own responsibility
Here too, the beneficiary may only be taxed downstream
As a general rule, the state must treat individual forms of pension provision equally from a tax perspective
10. more flexibility in working hours
Largely rigid collectively agreed and statutory working hours mean that machinery and equipment are used less intensively in Germany than in competitor countries
This competitive disadvantage must be reduced through more individualized working time arrangements
This includes, for example, more flexible shift work models, the general allowance of Saturday work, opening up for Sunday work as well, if jobs can be secured or created in this way
the greater possibility of transferring working hours from one week to the next, right up to annual or even lifetime working hours
The flexibilization of the labor market is also helped by temporary employment
Furthermore, a combination of part-time work and partial retirement must make possible a smooth transition to retirement
All this makes it possible to better reconcile the needs of the company with the wishes of the employees
This new flexibility leads above all to more efficient cost structures and creates more jobs
11. combing through labor law regulations
Over the decades, a thicket of labor law protection provisions has developed that may well have been justified at the time
From today's perspective, however, they often harm the very people they are supposed to protect
Excessive protection against dismissal forced many companies to resort to overtime rather than hiring new employees, even when business was good
The willingness to take over and restructure a company whose existence is threatened fails due to the legal obligation to continue to employ all employees of the company under the previous conditions
The F.D.P wants to change or abolish such outdated regulations
Furthermore, all legal regulations relating to the employment relationship should be summarized in a labor code
12. citizen's income incentives (''combination income'') for simple work
Numerous employment relationships have been lost due to the elimination of low-paid jobs or the relocation of simple productive activities or services abroad
People who are less qualified but could do simpler jobs are unemployed as a result and live on wage replacement benefits or social welfare
Such activities must become affordable on the German labor market
For employment relationships with low productivity, where the wage is not sufficient to provide an adequate income for employees and their families, improved mixed forms between pay and state transfer payments ("combined income", "negative tax") are to be used
The aim is to create an additional incentive to take up regular work by offsetting wages against unemployment benefit or social assistance to a lesser extent than before
By pooling and harmonizing state support services, it is also possible to move towards the "citizen's income system" proposed by the F.D.P.
13. more jobs through lower non-wage labor costs - social security reform
Sufficient new and secure jobs will only be created if we succeed in sustainably and permanently reducing non-wage labor costs in Germany
Both the collective bargaining partners and the legislator have a duty in this task
The social security systems must be put back on the basis of a long-term sustainable contract between young and old through structural reforms
This applies in particular to pension and health insurance
However, the fact that our social insurance systems have been overstretched for years and are becoming more and more strained, while contribution rates are constantly rising, makes it clear that state social insurance will increasingly lose the character of full insurance against all life risks and develop in the direction of basic provision
The F.D.P. has the courage to say this honestly to the citizens
It calls on citizens to supplement this basic provision with individual and flexible personal provision according to their own ideas and needs
The state must treat individual forms of pension provision equally in terms of taxation
Non-wage labor costs have developed into a special tax on jobs
This is why legislators and collective bargaining parties must seize every opportunity to reduce non-wage labor costs
The F.D.P. will continue the pension reform in the interests of pension security, reliable intergenerational contracts and labor market opportunities for the younger generation
The F.D.P. also wants to reduce contributions to other social insurance schemes
The F.D.P will not agree to the abolition or restriction of marginal employment relationships (620-DM/520-DM jobs)
The introduction of compulsory insurance would destroy a large proportion of these jobs without significantly improving the social security of those affected
14. innovation for jobs
Germany has built up a lead in productivity and international competitiveness through the market economy, creativity and diligence of its citizens
Market-based innovation and diligence on the part of our trading partners have reduced these advantages and even led to backlogs for some products
However, the following still applies: we will only be able to maintain our position on the global markets in the future with innovative products, production processes and services
Only a country with low taxes and duties is a good location for venture capital and innovation in the long term
Germany has excellent opportunities in modern technologies such as biotechnology and environmental technology
Many of the great inventions in the history of mankind were conceived and developed by German scientists
Even today, research in Germany continues to produce great achievements in research institutes, universities and companies
The common goal of politics, science and the economy must be to maintain this level and counteract migration trends
In particular, we need to improve the translation of research results into products and marketing: better equipped universities, practice-oriented research and teaching, training for independence, risk-taking and a sense of responsibility
Innovations must not fail due to future skills shortages
15. job opportunities in services
In the services sector, the German labor market for business-related and social services is underdeveloped
This is true in comparison with all our competitor countries, but it is also true as a perspective for the further path to the information society and for the future of reliable social systems
That is why the greatest opportunities for millions of new jobs lie in such services
Here too, policymakers must remove barriers to market entry on the path to independence.
and remove barriers to the recruitment of employees
However, politics cannot make the most important contribution to jobs in the service sector directly
All the more reason for the framework conditions of education, training and culture to promote the development of a new culture of independence
Venture Capital
16. startups
In particular, we want to provide targeted support for young entrepreneurs and start-ups
This includes granting incentives for participation in venture capital to private investors as well In the
event of losses, they should be able to offset these against other income for tax purposes - even beyond the existing instruments
This is always more sensible than allocating tax losses for real estate projects, ships or aircraft
The range of support for start-ups must be streamlined and concentrated on a few programs
17 Innovation and globalization in education
The education system must make a central contribution to promoting motivation, flexibility and innovation in the adjustment process
This requires reforms in schools, vocational training, university studies and continuing education
As part of an education offensive, more knowledge, skills and behavior must be taught that enable individuals to master the challenges of change with personal responsibility and a willingness to take risks The
current system of teaching and training content, examination regulations and training periods is too cumbersome; It takes less and less account of the demands of a constantly changing business and professional world
Educational institutions need more autonomy in the design of teaching content and in financing
And they must be in competition
Through personnel and professional exchange, the link with business and the professional world must become closer
More than in the past, schools and universities must also adapt to the globalization process, improve the chances of students in worldwide competition
Shortening school times, vocational school days and university studies improve the labor market opportunities of the young generation
18 Germany needs the euro
The F.D.P.'s policy contributed significantly to the punctual and treaty-compliant start of economic and monetary union
The task now is to realize their goals and implement them in practical policy
The euro is Europe's strategic response to the challenge of globalization
Monetary union creates the conditions for greater competitiveness of the German economy in the European environment and strengthens the European economy in global competition
Monetary union is a decisive step forward for the single market
No more distortions of the competitive position of individual countries due to politically controlled or distorted exchange rates
It is clear to the parties to collective agreements that they must adapt collective agreements to economic performance in international competition
The independent European Central Bank, based on the successful model of the German Bundesbank, and the agreed stability pact with its sanction mechanisms ensure that the euro will be no less stable than the German mark is at present
An internally and externally stable monetary value of the euro is an important prerequisite for investment, growth and jobs
The F.D.P. is standing for election with this program for a market economy renewal
We say: Germany has every chance
These opportunities must be used to create new jobs in Germany
19 For an entrepreneurial agriculture
Agriculture and forestry characterize rural areas
They fulfill a variety of tasks here and are an indispensable part of our society
They supply our population with high-quality food, renewable raw materials and contribute to the preservation and maintenance of natural resources and a diverse landscape as a settlement, economic and recreational area
Liberal agricultural policy must enable agricultural entrepreneurs in Germany and Europe to generate adequate incomes, be internationally competitive and sustainably fulfill the diverse tasks of agricultural production, the preservation of the cultural landscape, landscape conservation, nature conservation and environmental protection for society
European policy must help to ensure that rural areas can develop into competitive regions and that employment opportunities in rural areas can be further developed
This requires better coordination and coordination of EU measures in the areas of agricultural, structural and regional policy
The impact of EU agricultural support measures on animal welfare and environmental protection must be examined
Animal welfare and environmental protection must be sustainably improved and harmonized at a high level
This also applies in particular to animal transports within the EU and out of EU territory
German unification, the EC agricultural reform in 1992 and the results of the GATT round have changed the agricultural policy framework considerably
The pace of structural change has increased
The German agricultural sector is facing new challenges
For the F.D.P., farmers and foresters are first and foremost self-responsible, independent entrepreneurs
We want to create prospects for competitive, entrepreneurial and environmentally friendly agriculture
Further deregulation of agricultural markets is urgently needed to improve the future prospects for our farmers on the European and international markets:
Deregulation of European agricultural policy
- Liberal agricultural policy aims to gradually reduce intervention in the market
The aim must be that supply and demand are decisive for price formation in the EU
Milk quotas and compulsory set-asides must therefore be ended in the medium term
- The subsidization of agricultural exports must be gradually reduced worldwide within the framework of international negotiations in order to relieve the world's agricultural markets of price-suppressing surpluses caused by subsidies
This also improves the export opportunities of European agriculture in the long term
- Deregulation, cutting red tape and strengthening the responsibility of wine-growing regions must be the main criteria in the reform of the EU wine market organization
- Direct income transfers from the EU are indispensable as compensation for the higher environmental protection, animal welfare and hygiene requirements in the Community and as remuneration for the services provided to society by agriculture that are not remunerated via the market
However, the compensation system must be drastically simplified in order to relieve agriculture and the state administration of the current unjustifiable bureaucracy
Strengthening of agricultural enterprises
The F.D.P. is in favor of a diversity of agricultural forms and farming methods and even greater use of regional market opportunities
In order to improve the development opportunities of German agriculture and rural areas, the F.D.P. is calling for
- Individual company investment promotion will be continued in a targeted manner
It must be granted irrespective of the legal form of the company and its economic activity, with an even stronger focus on the profitability and competitiveness of the supported company
- The position of agricultural enterprises vis-à-vis their market partners must be strengthened by bundling agricultural offers and through direct marketing
- The coordinated use of proven support instruments for improving the agricultural structure and regional economic structure and for supporting village renewal must be continued
- Structural change must be socially flanked by the continuation of the production task pension
- The young farmer and business start-up programs must be continued
- The development and application of ethically and ecologically justifiable measures in biotechnology and genetic engineering must not be hindered
- The labor market for workers in agriculture and forestry must be made flexible, especially through seasonal workers and 620/520-DM jobs
- The range of business consulting services must be expanded with the aim of orienting production more strongly towards the market
- Building and environmental legislation must be streamlined in order to relieve agricultural and forestry enterprises of excessive and inefficient bureaucratic regulations
- New sources of income must be developed in the areas of tourism, landscape conservation and the cultivation of renewable raw materials
- Agricultural services in return for the maintenance of our cultural landscape and for nature conservation, which are not compensated by the market, are not subsidies; they must be rewarded through income subsidies
However, agricultural incomes must not become totally dependent on state benefits
Farmers must have the opportunity to earn the majority of their income on the market
- Appropriate compensation must be granted if official nature conservation measures restrict the previous agricultural and forestry land use beyond the extent of good professional practice regulated in the relevant legislation
II. for an education offensive
Liberal civil society needs education and training as elementary prerequisites for freedom, tolerance and performance
Education is the ethical foundation for civil society and creates jobs
Liberal education policy guarantees young people the best foundations for leading a self-determined life and assuming responsibility for themselves and others
Everyone is offered the same opportunities for education
This equality of opportunity at the start does not mean equality of results at the finish
Education is the new social issue of the 21st century.
In globalization, success on the labor market will depend more and more on qualifications In
addition to social qualifications and knowledge, education must also promote entrepreneurship and a spirit of entrepreneurship
Globalization and project work increasingly require initiative and a willingness to take risks
This must already be taken into account in schools and universities
Our education system needs reforms now!
We will not save on education
Despite scarce resources, the F.D.P. is calling for an increase in the proportion of spending on education
and prioritizes investment in education and research in public budgets
The federal holdings must be privatized in the next five years
The proceeds and interest savings are to be used specifically to reduce the federal budget and for an innovation and education initiative
Only with a wide variety of different educational offers and organizational forms can current and future requirements be met
Future-oriented liberal education policy therefore focuses on reforms to educational goals and content, the organization and financing of education - from schools to vocational training and universities
Only independent educational institutions can create a diverse range of services and more efficient use of resources in the education system
That is why we want a redistribution of responsibility in the education sector: to strengthen the autonomy of educational institutions, for competition for the better concepts and thus also for the education participants themselves
For us, private educational institutions are a useful addition to the state education system
They are to be promoted
School
Schools should give students the best start in life
This includes, above all, awakening a readiness for lifelong learning and training the skills to do so
Schools should accompany families in the teaching of values, such as education in humanity and tolerance, the ability to engage in discussion and conflict, against violence and contempt for humanity
The F.D.P. demands:
- Diversity and independence should be developed in schools, freedom should be opened up and the self-administration of individual schools should be strengthened so that competition between schools is also encouraged
- The diversity of the structured school system must be maintained and supplemented by a needs-based all-day program in cooperation with extracurricular institutions (youth welfare office, clubs, churches, etc.)
For us, this also means strengthening the Hauptschule
The options for private school sponsorship should be simplified; in these forms of organization, the state essentially only has to ensure the comparability of qualifications
Alternative offers, more competition and new forms of learning are thus made possible
- Schools must take a differentiated approach to the ability and readiness of pupils
We need systematic support for gifted children
Supporting gifted and talented people is not a contradiction in terms
Grading in elementary school is an indispensable performance control and self-assessment for teachers and pupils in order to prepare a school career that is geared to the pupils' talents and inclinations
Reports on learning success and learning progress are a necessary supplement, but (from grade 3) no substitute for grade reports
The informative value of certificates must be increased
If you want to improve quality in schools, you also have to allow information on learning and social behavior
- Foreign language lessons should already be offered in elementary school
- The school must awaken a positive understanding of technology and science
The opportunities offered by new technological developments must be seized more quickly and effectively by schools
The content of the lessons should take greater account of the realities of the business and working world than before
Technology, business and science in social responsibility will play a central role in determining educational and learning objectives
School education should present economic interrelationships as a crucial foundation of our democratic society and encourage increased professional independence
It must convey the ability to deal competently with new media and information and to select information
Leadership and teamwork skills, entrepreneurial spirit and creativity, an understanding of history and values, an understanding of democracy and civic responsibility, the ability to see change as an opportunity, understanding global interrelationships and thinking and acting in an environmentally friendly way are among the skills to be increasingly promoted
Teacher training must also turn to the new media
At present, it can no longer meet the requirements of the education system
The individual training phases must be reviewed and further developed to meet the changing requirements of an education system in a liberal meritocracy
The range of teacher training courses must be expanded
Attendance - even during non-teaching hours - is mandatory at certain intervals
- Learning for the information society and learning with the means of the information society must begin in schools
Every young person must be guaranteed access to information technology through the public education system
Schools must be equipped with the necessary facilities, school networks should be set up and/or existing data networks should be able to be used free of charge
The opportunities offered by private sponsorship should also be utilized to a greater extent
- The integration of children with disabilities must be promoted
- In Hauptschulen and Realschulen, final examinations are to be introduced as part of the overall qualification
This raises the profile of these two types of school and gives their graduates a better chance on the job market
- Our students should learn a lot, but not for too long
They should not learn less, they should learn differently
Greater emphasis must be placed on learning long-term methodological knowledge
A reform of the educational content and more flexible offers to shorten individual school terms - including possible earlier school starts adapted to the children's level of development - make it possible to shorten school terms without sacrificing educational quality
This is also the prerequisite for the Abitur after 12 school years, which the F.D.P. demands for all federal states
Certain minimum standards (German, mathematics, one natural science, one foreign language) must be defined in order to counteract the de facto devaluation of the Abitur as an entry requirement for university studies
- Newly hired teachers are to be employed as salaried employees
Schools to be given more powers in personnel selection
This also takes into account the idea of performance and the improvement of teaching and teacher commitment
Vocational education
One goal of liberal education policy is to raise the level of qualification of the entire population
In this context, practical occupations are just as important as scientific training
We want the natural sciences to be given greater consideration in vocational training as well, in order to ensure the qualification of the future workforce demanded by modern technology, since the occupational demands on employees will increase in the future We
We will therefore continue to develop the dual system of vocational education and training, differentiate it more strongly and strive for equivalence between vocational and general education and training
The F.D.P. demands:
- Business and politics must take joint responsibility for modernizing dual vocational training and ensuring a sufficient supply of training places
An apprenticeship levy is rejected by the F.D.P.
- Particularly talented people must also be supported in vocational training
This includes the opportunity to acquire additional qualifications during training
Access to the university must be kept open
- Young people who were previously excluded from vocational training due to excessive theoretical requirements must also be given a chance
Staged training (modular training) to demonstrate practical occupational skills can facilitate initial entry into the labor market
- The promotion and career opportunities for VET graduates must be expanded compared to those of university graduates
This is a matter for the economy, but also for the public sector
- As an alternative to full-time study, more training courses should be offered that combine work and study
- In order for young people to be able to take advantage of opportunities on the international labor market on an equal footing, foreign language teaching for the relevant professions must be strengthened
At the same time, the transparency of professional qualifications must be ensured
- Lessons at the vocational school must generally be organized in such a way that a second day of vocational school does not have to take place
To achieve this, the curricula must be freed from subjects such as sport or religion
In cooperation with the vocational schools, the companies must be given more competence to organize the lessons according to their needs
The Federal Government is instructed to present a report on the social situation of trainees by mid-1999
According to this, the need to adjust the training support for apprentices to bring it into line with the support for students must be reviewed
University
Our mission statement for the future university is: independent, scientific, competitive, distinguished, international and economical
This vision can only be realized if the centralistic and bureaucratic structures of the current university system are overcome
Education, science and research must once again be given priority in politics and the budgets of the federal and state governments
The necessary, considerable additional expenditure is to be financed from reallocations and the use of privatization proceeds
As a first step, the F.D.P. is calling for a special federal-state university program of DM 10 billion for the next legislative period
This program is intended to improve the conditions for successful learning at universities and remedy the most serious shortcomings
We want to increase funding for university construction to DM 2.3 billion per year
The F.D.P. demands:
- Universities need more autonomy than they have been granted in Germany to date
This includes an internal organizational and responsibility structure geared towards performance and competition,
the abolition of the ZVS and the transfer of its competencies back to the universities, personnel sovereignty, collective bargaining autonomy, global budgets
and - in addition to basic funding - additional performance-related funding via education vouchers and research funds
- Third-party funding in the field of research, both in terms of research and development and the exploitation of research results (patents, utility models, etc.), must also be part of university income
To this end, universities must strive for closer cooperation with industry
The transfer of results and methods between the development centers of SMEs and universities must be expanded
This can be realized, for example, through a temporary mutual exchange of personnel
- The idea of competition - long established in research - must also be realized in the field of teaching
Here, student demand must be a decisive factor in directing the flow of state funding
The F.D.P. wants to promote competition through the introduction of education vouchers
The education vouchers embody ''rights to education'' and are provided free of charge by the state for studies up to the acquisition of a first professional qualification
This ensures equal opportunities for every student, regardless of their social background
Upon enrollment, students receive the number of educational vouchers required to complete their studies
This refers to the courses required for the desired degree program: Lectures, seminars, tutorials etc., but also examinations
Education vouchers are provided regardless of the personal situation, but depending on the course of study
The F.D.P. rejects the introduction of general tuition fees at the present time, as the situation at many universities makes a mockery of charging for university education
In the coming legislative period, the focus must be on implementing the education reforms
Only the results of the 10 billion federal-state university special program in particular can form the basis for further discussions on reforms
Those who demand tuition fees today are shifting responsibility for structural deficiencies, inadmissibly restricting equal opportunities and once again placing an excessive burden on middle-income families
- Competition between universities for applicants and research funding should also be promoted through greater transparency with regard to their facilities and performance
Regular internal and external assessments of universities' objectives and performance in research and teaching and the publication of their results are intended to make it easier for applicants to find the universities best suited to their personal goals
Applicants should be given the right to apply directly to the university of their choice
The F.D.P. expects increasing competition between universities to lead to content and organizational reforms of teaching and learning content, also with the aim of enabling the first professionally qualifying degree not after 14.4 semesters but after 8 to 10 semesters (in suitable courses after just 6 semesters)
Anyone who wants to complete a degree in a short time must have the opportunity to do so
It is unreasonable to expect young, motivated people to waste time with long study periods
We need the innovative impetus of young talent earlier than before
The shortening of the school years up to the Abitur to 12 years and the aforementioned reforms serve this purpose
For the F.D.P., an essential cornerstone of its policy is to enable different life plans and to create the framework conditions that allow everyone to shape their life according to the ideas that give them the best opportunities
Lifelong learning and a changing labor market, in addition to new forms of family life, are increasingly leading to part-time courses and part-time study, so that a fixed period of study based on young full-time students cannot be adhered to
- The initial appointment of professors should generally only be for a fixed term
In future, professors will no longer be civil servants
Universities should be given autonomy in terms of personnel and decide for themselves who they employ and for how long
Universities must also be able to decide to a greater extent on the conditions for appointments themselves
The F.D.P. has already paved the way for this by abolishing the habilitation as a binding requirement for appointments in the amendment to the Higher Education Framework Act
- The state framework conditions for foundations, scholarships and private commitment must be significantly improved, because the support of science by non-profit organizations is an indispensable component of science funding
Private sector sponsorship, e.g. for university renovations and the development of study programs, must also become the norm in Germany
The state framework conditions must be created for this
Universities that are still state-run today are to be transformed into foundation universities or corporations, such as those that operate successfully in the United States
Private universities in this form are also to be established
The F.D.P. will create the necessary legal conditions for the establishment of such a university in each federal state, either as a private start-up or as a converted state university, in which innovative structures, procedures and contents can be tested
In this way too, competition between the various models should contribute to the renewal of the higher education landscape
- Universities of applied sciences must be expanded more quickly
The concept of education vouchers will give them new opportunities for development
- More part-time degree courses should be offered
- Germany must be made more attractive again as a place to study for foreign students
- The F.D.P. advocates a fundamental reform of BAföG
From a liberal perspective, equal opportunities in education must be guaranteed
The F.D.P. has already expressed its conviction that students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds must be supported by the implementation of the changeover from full loans to a half-grant regulation for BAföG
In order to ensure existing inequalities and a long-term basis for sufficient BAföG funding, the so-called three-basket model must be implemented quickly
- In the medium term, the partial refinancing of training costs should be ensured by means of a so-called ''subsequent tuition fee'' (Australian model)
University graduates pay a certain amount back to the university each month from their earnings
Continuing education
For liberals, continuing education - understood as ''lifelong learning'' - has three equally important components: a personal development, a political-historical and a professional component.
Further training is crucial for employees' qualifications, job security and access to new employment opportunities
In Germany, the continuing education system in its pluralistic and competitively organized structure is largely successful without state specifications and possibilities for intervention
The F.D.P. rejects uniform federal framework laws, financing requirements or compulsory certification
It adheres to the principles of diversity and competition between providers and services
Competition between providers on the market has positive effects on content and methods
The F.D.P. is in favor of voluntary quality certificates by chambers and/or state institutions to ensure sufficient standards and to provide orientation for participants
The F.D.P. demands:
Further training must and should continue to involve a personal contribution in terms of time and money
Society does not need a kind of ''continuing education subsidy'' for everyone, but must use the scarce state funds for those who urgently need them
These include, in particular, groups of people who need to be integrated or reintegrated into the work process: Unemployed, unskilled, disadvantaged and disabled people, as well as women reintegrating into work
Research and technology
An important component of liberal research and technology policy is the creation of a social environment in which research and the implementation of research results in new processes and products can flourish and are accepted
Promoting innovation is just as essential
such as deregulation and more competition
However, this also includes a consistent "yes" to meritocratic elites
For liberals, the freedom of research is sacrosanct
Scientists and technicians are called upon to use this guaranteed freedom creatively and innovatively in responsibility towards the present and future generations
We will provide reliable and increased funding for cutting-edge and basic research
We want to make research funding predictable and ensure continuity in the funding of cutting-edge and basic research
The liberal approach to research funding consists of promoting creative diversity and counteracting the growth of large institutions at the expense of small ones
The F.D.P. demands:
- Primarily, university research is to be supported on a project basis
It is efficient because it involves students in research and thus accelerates the transfer of knowledge and the implementation of results
- The entire regulatory thicket of state laws, ordinances, requirements, examination and approval procedures must be systematically reviewed to determine whether it still meets modern requirements for efficient, unbureaucratic handling and purposes required by the current state of science and technology
For a liberal cultural policy
Liberals want cultural diversity and openness
The task of the state is to protect the freedom of culture
Freedom of expression also means freedom of art, science, research and teaching
The liberal cultural state promotes access to culture
Liberal cultural policy aims to provide a diverse offering for all citizens so that they can participate in culture on an equal footing - regardless of their social status and educational background
The preservation and promotion of art and culture are part of an offer for all citizens to fulfill their lives and find values
The diversity of culture includes cultural-political neutrality and tolerance of the state towards art
State support for the arts should secure the basis for the free development of art
The F.D.P. demands:
- Art and culture need independence from bureaucracies and state regulations in order to flourish
and material support from private and public funds
The F.D.P. is in favor of private cultural investment without releasing the public sector from its duty
Cultural promotion must remain a public task
- Liberals, however, reject any paternalism and any censoring intervention in artistic and cultural life
They also support free initiative outside of state and municipal cultural institutions
They provide space for new and experimental forms of culture
- The freedom of the arts is part of the basic understanding of liberal cultural policy
However, the freedom of art also includes promoting art
The cultural state requirement of our constitution demands this
Even with a tight budget situation, it is important to ensure that our country fully lives up to its obligations as a cultural nation
Nevertheless, it will be essential to tap into a higher level of private commitment to art and culture
This is why the F.D.P. relies on sponsors from industry, private patrons, development associations and foundations
The willingness of many citizens and businesses to become more involved in the arts and culture should be encouraged through culture-friendly framework conditions
The F.D.P. expressly rejects the idea of imposing a tax burden on cultural sponsorship and patronage by business and private individuals
On the contrary, this form of cultural promotion needs to be expanded
- The F.D.P. calls for a reform and reorganization of foundation and endowment tax law; this can make further private funds available for cultural purposes
A new foundation law should also combine cultural freedom with cultural promotion and secure both
In particular, the foundation stone for a cultural foundation is to be laid in order to build on this and include private commitment in the promotion of culture
- Despite enormous efforts in the past, the development and maintenance of the cultural infrastructure in the new federal states still requires support
- As a result of reunification, the federal government has taken on numerous tasks in the field of culture, which are currently managed by different ministries
The F.D.P. demands the bundling of competences and responsibilities as well as the establishment of a cultural committee of the German Bundestag as parliamentary control
However, due to the cultural sovereignty of the federal states, no competing federal ministry is to be created
- In a united Europe, the abolition of internal borders must also fully benefit the cross-border movement of cultural goods
Artistic and cultural actions at European level should become the norm
They offer the opportunity to overcome national prejudices
III Liberal is social
The most social policy is to fight unemployment
Fundamental reform of our social security systems is one of the most important tasks
Instead of a state economy of the best social intentions, liberals want the market economy of the best social results
The social order is ailing from encrusted structures, overregulation, lack of competition, lack of transparency and lack of performance incentives
Only when performance pays can what is needed by those who are weak, sick or infirm be generated
Reforms are urgently needed
Sustainable security systems
The wage-related nature of social security benefits makes them particularly dependent on the development of employment and wages
Because of the upheavals on the labor market and demographic developments, social security systems must be adapted to the changed circumstances
The F.D.P. wants genuine structural reforms and no further tax subsidies to unreformed systems
Our goal is to reduce contributions to statutory social insurance schemes to below 40 percent
Generationally appropriate and reliable old-age provision
Today's pension system has almost always solved its financing problems by increasing contributions This
is unfair
As a result, today's young generation pays maximum contributions with highly uncertain pension returns The
F.D.P. demands that priority be given to contribution stability in the future Contributions
to the statutory pension insurance must be permanently reduced to below 20% The
F.D.P. rejects a tax-financed basic pension as being inimical to performance
The structural reform of the pension insurance system must therefore be consistently continued The
goals of liberal reform are pension security, contribution stability and intergenerational justice
The F.D.P. demands:
- the gradual transition to a mixed form of pay-as-you-go and funded pension provision
This means that in future, the statutory pension insurance scheme will enable basic old-age provision financed by contributions, supplemented by funded personal provision
This allows for an individual decision on the extent to which the standard of living is secured in old age
- Transparency of the federal subsidy for statutory pension insurance paid from tax revenue
The federal subsidy to the statutory pension insurance scheme for blue and white-collar workers alone amounted to around DM 67 billion in 1997 Following the increase in the federal subsidy as a result of the Pension Reform Act '99, this federal subsidy will account for well over DM 90 billion from 1999 onwards and thus around 25 % of total pension insurance expenditure
This federal subsidy must be clearly allocated to the so-called non-insurance benefits
Only if the extent to which the tax-financed federal subsidy covers non-insurance benefits is disclosed can it be prevented in future that more and more tax money is diverted into the pension insurance scheme
Otherwise, the gradual slide of our pension insurance system into tax financing is unavoidable in view of the pension insurance system's financial problems over the next few years
The F.D.P. demands the closure of the Knappschaft special pension scheme and the transfer of new entrants to the general pension insurance scheme
- The preservation of the professional pension schemes
The review of the so-called pension gaps following the amended pension transition of the special and supplementary pension schemes in the new federal states, in particular the pension scheme for former Reichsbahner
- More scope for personal provision through tax relief
Tax reform is a basic prerequisite for independent pension provision
Capital formation and switching investment forms must be tax-exempt
Equal tax treatment of investment forms creates additional scope for private, funded pension provision
This is the only way to expand opportunities and scope for independent provision in civil society
- Pension fund for occupational pension provision and capital cover
In addition to tax and labor law improvements to the framework conditions for traditional company pensions, better opportunities for employees to participate in company assets in particular mean a strengthening of company pension schemes
One suitable approach is to set up company pension funds
The deposits remain tax-free and are only taxed when they are paid out to the recipient
The establishment of company pension funds will also significantly stimulate the capital market
The higher return makes it easier to switch to capital cover in the start-up phase
The funded form of retirement provision can also be used in the context of investment wages, such as ''savings wages instead of cash wages'' concepts
- Extension of the average working life
No pay-as-you-go pension system in the world can sustain an average working age of 28 for students and an average retirement age of 59 in the long term
Education and training periods must be shortened and retirement made more flexible
Shorter training periods and a correspondingly earlier entry into working life reduce the burden on the pension system and increase labor market opportunities as well as lifetime earnings
Because better utilization of working life means higher pensionable income and more capital available for old-age provision
- Independent pension provision for women
In order to strengthen equal rights, women's independent pension provision must be further improved
To this end, child-raising periods and care services must be better valued in pension insurance in future
This can be financed, for example, by a corresponding restructuring of the current survivors' pension, for which around 22% of pension contributions are currently used, or by recognizing child-rearing as a separate contribution
Generational balance
For liberals, social justice is only that which is also fair between generations
The F.D.P. is therefore calling for the annual presentation of a generational balance sheet by the Federal Government
This generational balance sheet must show debit and credit: On the one hand, the benefits or for education and training, on the other hand, the burdens, e.g. through national debt, pension burdens and intergenerational contracts
The intergenerational balance sheet promotes awareness of the principle of responsibility for future generations and strengthens cohesion between the generations
Intergenerational justice means recognizing the lifetime achievements of the older generation and securing the future for the younger generation
Health insurance is on the right track
Liberals want a liberal healthcare system without excessive bureaucracy
and without the rationing of health services
We want citizens to share responsibility for their health, free choice of doctor and freedom of therapy
The F.D.P. has already set the course for this in healthcare policy
The third stage of healthcare reform bears a clear liberal signature
Our goals are:
- Strengthening of individual responsibility instead of collective all-round care,
- Competition instead of regulation, -
Choice instead of uniform tariffs, -
Negotiated solutions instead of budgeting, -
Reduction of contributions to statutory health insurance instead of a constant additional burden on employees and employers
- Information and transparency instead of paternalism
In view of medical progress and increasing life expectancy of citizens, the health care system must be constantly further developed
The F.D.P. demands:
- Enabling and strengthening personal responsibility
We want to ensure that every citizen continues to receive the necessary medical care in the event of illness in the future
However, in view of the challenges posed by the increasing proportion of older people and medical progress, among other things, this can only be successfully achieved if we focus proactively on the individual's responsibility for their health and the use of healthcare services
Prevention and preventive healthcare are an important contribution that everyone can make to stay as healthy as possible
- Securing healthcare without overburdening non-wage labor costs
The benefits provided by the statutory health insurance funds (SHI) must be adapted to changing conditions
| The F.D.P. does not want queues in front of hospitals or doctors who have to stop their treatment due to exhausted budgets
However, what is medically necessary must be financed
To ease the burden on contribution rates, the VAT on pharmacy-only medicines should be reduced to the reduced VAT rate
Despite future challenges, healthcare must not lead to rising non-wage labor costs
This can be achieved, for example, by fixing the employer's contribution
- Flexibilization of contract law
This further strengthens the autonomy of the individual health insurance funds and their associations, and the positive effects of competition come into play
Statutory requirements for joint and uniform action by the statutory health insurance funds should be reduced, as should state approval requirements
- Optimization of the range of services
Certain clinical pictures, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatism, cancer, etc., require special patient care that must function smoothly across all sectors
Service providers and health insurance companies must do even greater justice to these special requirements in their agreements
The conditions for this have been created in principle with the expansion of the scope for action through the last reform
Where necessary, the competencies of the self-administration should be further strengthened in this direction
- Responsible reduction of risk structure compensation
In order to strengthen the individual responsibility of the individual health insurance funds, the nationwide risk structure equalization must be gradually reduced
However, the F.D.P. rejects the regionalization of the SHI system
- Structure as a constitutive element of the competition
The F.D.P. maintains the structured health insurance system consisting of statutory and private health insurers
The peace line between statutory and private health insurance has proven its worth
- Transition from the principle of benefits in kind to the principle of cost reimbursement
The non-transparent principle of benefits in kind, which patronizes doctors and patients, hinders the further development of a liberal and more market-oriented system
Instead, cost reimbursement offers patients and service providers maximum transparency about the services used and their prices
It should therefore be used wherever this is possible without overburdening the patient
- Seizing opportunities in Europe
It is important to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the free movement of goods and services in the European Union to increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness and to loosen up the bureaucratically encrusted healthcare system, e.g. through cost reimbursement and more flexible forms of remuneration
The F.D.P. relies on the fresh wind of competition in the European internal market in the interests of insured persons and service providers
Long-term care insurance
Since its launch on January 1, 1995, long-term care insurance has brought about noticeable improvements On the
one hand, more people in need of care can continue to live with their families
; on the other hand, the benefits provided by long-term care insurance mean that people in need of care have to make less use of social welfare benefits Long-term
care insurance has already accumulated surpluses of DM 9.5 billion at the current contribution rate of 1.7% In
In view of this considerable sum, the F.D.P. is in favor of reducing the contributions for a limited period of time and thus returning the surpluses to the contributors
This reduces ancillary wage costs
The quality of care, especially in inpatient facilities, must not be impaired by this In the
long term, the number of people in need of care will increase due to demographic developments
However, income will decline due to the falling number of employees The
resulting cost pressure must not lead to an increase in contributions
In the view of the F.D.P., the course must also be set in good time here by means of supplementary personal provision in the form of capital cover
Social assistance
Social welfare is the state's indispensable assistance for people in need who are unable to help themselves
The F.D.P. wants social aid to promote the will of citizens to achieve personal and financial independence and to encourage them to work hard
For this reason, the principle of ''helping people to help themselves'' and the principle of ''no benefit without consideration'' must apply to all types of social benefits in future - including the provision of social assistance
Anyone receiving social assistance must in future make their own efforts to improve their situation
The obligation to provide consideration is only waived for those who are unable to do so due to their own health, personal or family situation
This is the only way to concentrate the benefits provided by the solidarity-based community on those who really need them and to increase the accuracy of the social system
Anyone who refuses, without objective justification, to contribute to improving their situation on their own responsibility, e.g. by accepting work or attending courses, is not entitled to the full solidarity-based assistance of the community
However, the F.D.P. recognizes the difficult situation of children in welfare recipient families
Therefore, children must not be disadvantaged by this
Social assistance must no longer discourage people from working, but must offer clear incentives to take up gainful employment
Working for yourself must be more worthwhile than receiving welfare benefits
The citizens' income system called for by the Liberals can make a decisive contribution here
Citizen's income
The F.D.P.'s citizen's income system is the solution for overcoming high unemployment in the low-wage sector and for a transparent social system
It combines income taxation and tax-financed social benefits into a simple overall system and is the best way to create incentives to take up work
The first steps towards this liberal concept are the basic tax-free allowance in the amount of the minimum subsistence level and the equalization of family benefits
Today, a total of 153 social benefits are granted by 37 different social bureaucracies according to different criteria
| According to the F.D.P.'s citizens' income concept, the tax-financed types of social assistance will be bundled into one form of assistance as far as possible in future
Only one authority - the tax office - offsets this against income tax and pays a citizen's allowance to the socially disadvantaged or collects tax according to the citizen's ability to pay
As an incentive to take up regular gainful employment, only part of the earned income is counted towards the citizen's income entitlement
This means that work is also worthwhile in the low-wage sector, where productivity-oriented pay would not even secure the minimum subsistence level
In the low-wage sector in particular, it is becoming increasingly important to close the gap between wages that are affordable for companies and wages that are sufficient for a self-reliant life
Without such a bridge through the citizen's income system, rising low-wage unemployment would continue to shake our social system
Wherever possible, society's solidarity-based assistance should aim to help people return to work
The goal is not permanent retirement, but the ability to earn a sufficient income from one's own employment
A reformed system of income taxation and tax-financed social benefits leads to greater social justice through greater transparency and opportunities for people to take responsibility for their own lives,
ensures a decent existence financially,
creates incentives for gainful employment
, reduces bureaucracy
and ensures efficiency in social transfers
Citizen's income is a core element of the liberal welfare state
Promote and challenge youth
Every generation has a duty to preserve the opportunities for freedom for future generations and not to risk them through debt or consumption
From labor market policy to environmental policy, the principle of responsibility for future generations must apply
For liberals, youth policy is more than '''care policy by adults for minors'''
In particular, it is about intergenerational justice to preserve the ecological, economic and social foundations of life for future generations
For liberals, solidarity also means solidarity between the generations
The benefits of the present must no longer be financed with mortgages on future generations
The intergenerational contract must be placed on a reliable and sustainable basis
| This means continuing the reform of the social security systems with more scope for personal responsibility
Liberal youth policy aims to improve the development opportunities of young people by promoting initiative, participation and personal responsibility
Education for independence corresponds to the liberal view of human nature
The F.D.P. considers the comprehensive participation of young people in decisions that affect them and their age group to be important
Policy for the young generation means securing ecological and economic opportunities for the future
Protecting the environment is also part of this
such as reducing public debt
The principle of responsibility for the next generation must protect the natural foundations of life
The aim is a structural change towards sustainable forms of economic activity
The biggest social problems facing young people at the moment are unemployment, the situation on the apprenticeship market and the lack of higher education opportunities
Young people will only see prospects in our society if education and the teaching of values are linked to concrete training and career opportunities
Equal opportunities for women and men
For the F.D.P. Women's policy is a task that is included in every part of the program
The disadvantage of women compared to men must be eliminated
Civil society must give women and men equal opportunities in all areas of life
Only those who determine their own lives can decide consciously and freely The
basis of education and youth policy is education for equal partnership between women and men
Disadvantages must be eliminated and equal independent living must be promoted,
Reconciliation of family and work must become a common concern of women and men
The result should be that gainful employment and family work enjoy equal social recognition
Men and women must not be discriminated against because of their child-rearing and family work.
The F.D.P. demands:
- qualified part-time jobs, also for management positions,
- flexible working hours,
- promotion of company childcare facilities that are coordinated with working hours, -
flexible options for reducing working hours for family reasons, -
more offers for reintegration into working life, - in the
future, women should be able to serve in the armed forces voluntarily and on an equal footing, also with weapons and within the framework of international peace missions of the Bundeswehr
We have succeeded in having child-rearing and care periods more strongly recognized in pension law
The F.D.P. emphatically confirms its position on the current legal situation regarding § 218 of the German Penal Code, which focuses on the responsible decision of the woman in the case of a pregnancy conflict, after weighing her personal situation and in the knowledge of all state assistance.
Strengthening families - respecting communities of responsibility
Marriage and family are the supporting communities of responsibility in liberal civil society
The F.D.P. recognizes the special importance of families
They are an important basis for social orientation, stability and the communication of values
Marriage and family must therefore continue to be subject to special protection by the state
Families must be relieved as part of a major tax reform
In addition to marriage and the family, many new communities of responsibility have formed in which people with and without children live together according to their own rules and individual wishes
The F.D.P. respects all communities in which people take responsibility for one another
The F.D.P. is therefore committed to eliminating the discrimination against non-married couples that still exists in many areas of law today
The F.D.P.'s reform of parenthood, for example, provides better protection against discrimination for children from non-marital partnerships
The F.D.P. has thus realized joint parental custody for children in non-marital partnerships
For same-sex couples who want to live together permanently, a state-recognized permanent commitment - with rights and obligations - must be made possible
The F.D.P. therefore advocates the creation of the legal institution of "civil partnership"
The civil partnership must be based on family law in fundamental questions and to a large extent - especially in inheritance law, tenancy law, insurance law, immigration law and social law - establish comparable rights and obligations
In order to prevent social discrimination in the world of work, the existing anti-discrimination provisions should be supplemented to prevent discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality
Learning from each other - living together
The humanity of a society shows itself in dealing with disabled people
Therefore, the F.D.P. will do everything in its power to enforce Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the German Constitution ''No one may be disadvantaged because of his or her disability'': People with disabilities must be integrated into society as far as possible; this applies in particular to attendance at kindergartens, schools and vocational training facilities
Integration must be combined with support that gives disabled people the opportunity to develop their talents so that they can participate in social life on an equal footing and make their own special contribution to an open civil society
Guidelines for disability-friendly planning need to be revised
They all too often lead to costly results today and are therefore frequently not implemented
Active and self-determined in old age
''Staying on'' and ''staying in'' must become the defining principles of a sustainable senior citizens' policy
Responsibility knows no retirement
And personal responsibility cannot be retired
Older people do not want or need special rights, but acceptance of their life's achievements
Senior citizens live and experience their third phase of life as a phase of responsibility for themselves, for children and grandchildren and for society
The proportion of older people in the overall population will continue to increase in the coming years due to demographic trends
The F.D.P. sees this development as both a challenge and an opportunity
Senior citizens' policy affects young and old alike: The F.D.P. wants the generations to work together, not against each other, wants dialog and the elimination of prejudices
Older people don't want to be patronized, they want to pass on their experience
They are not a burden on the state, they want to help shape it
Politicians must create the necessary framework conditions for this
The F.D.P. demands:
- all regulations, laws and provisions that discriminate against older people must be abolished,
- comprehensive educational programs for older people,
- the promotion and support of senior citizens' projects and discussion groups,
- to promote integrated living with a mix of generations,
- Medical care, particularly in geriatric psychiatry, must be improved by increasing the number of professorships and training and further education for doctors and nursing staff,
- a nationwide standardized elderly care law
For a rethink in drug policy
The addiction and drug problem in Germany is a danger to society
The first contact with addictive substances is often the trying of cigarettes and alcohol
While the use of conventional hard drugs has stagnated in recent years, the use of synthetic drugs, especially ecstasy, is increasing significantly
Addiction cannot be effectively combated with criminalization and repression
Addiction is a disease
The F.D.P. demands:
- the long-term, nationwide implementation of comprehensive prevention strategies, the provision of information on the effects and side effects of substance abuse and on measures to prevent lasting damage,
- the needs-based expansion of a differentiated range of therapies that guarantees the immediate start of therapy,
- an improvement in basic and applied research,
- the further development of substitution programs and the controlled supply of heroin to severely addicted persons for bridging and therapeutic purposes under strict medical supervision and to prevent drug-related crime,
- the establishment of supervised fixer rooms,
- improving the fight against organized drug crime and international drug trafficking,
- a standardized practice of the federal states for the penalty-free possession of small amounts of hashish for personal consumption, as demanded by the Federal Constitutional Court,
- the general ban on the sale of soft drugs, e.g. in pharmacies
Sport
Over 30 million Germans are actively involved in sport
26 million people alone play organized sport in over 85,000 clubs
In addition, there are millions more athletes, whether non-organized, self-organized or commercially organized
Sport is an area of life for everyone, especially young people, in which liberal and social values and goals complement each other perfectly
Sport should therefore be promoted politically
Liberal sports policy supports elite sport as well as popular sport, sport in schools, clubs, companies and commercial facilities as well as sport as a leisure activity or therapy
Citizens are constantly developing new sporting needs and organizational models for practicing or consuming sport
The dynamics of these changes need to be taken into account and addressed, especially as liberal basic convictions are realized in sport:
- In a democratically constituted sports self-government, responsible citizens take responsibility for matters that affect them
Necessary rules are set independently and autonomously
- In its individual sports, sport thrives on competition and the pursuit of performance
The various sports on offer are diverse
- Liberal qualities such as initiative, innovativeness and a willingness to take risks, but also fairness, are developed in sport
- Social behavior in groups is trained
This is a particularly important educational aspect for young adolescents who live in small or partial families
- Club sport is an important voluntary contribution to social (youth) work
A free society depends on its citizens being prepared to take responsibility for themselves and others in a free decision
Voluntary work is therefore of great importance for the cohesion of civil society
The voluntary assumption of responsibility and a sense of citizenship is superior to coercion and the patronizing welfare state
The framework conditions for volunteering must therefore be improved
Young people should be familiarized with volunteering at an early age
IV. Freedom and justice in the 21st century
All people are different
In their human dignity and before the law, however, all people are equal
That is why it is not just about formal legal equality, but about the opportunity to participate in society on an equal footing
In order to protect the freedom to choose the most diverse life plans, the law is needed as an objective authority
Guaranteeing freedom means protecting the rights of minorities
Only by establishing and enforcing the law, regardless of the individual, is it possible to ensure equal opportunities
The expression of this image of the state is the rule of law
The state is not the guardian of citizens, but their instrument for securing an open civil society
Therefore, it is not the state that grants freedom to the citizens, but the citizens that grant the state restrictions on their freedom in order to safeguard the equal rights of all
Nevertheless, the state needs constant legitimization from citizens to maintain and expand its activities, which are characterized by overregulation
For this reason, liberal fundamental rights, as an expression of the rule of law, are defensive rights of citizens vis-à-vis the state and of the minority vis-à-vis the majority
Complete inner unity
Completing the internal unification of Germany and overcoming the material and immaterial consequences, damage and after-effects of the SED dictatorship will remain one of the outstanding tasks of German society for many years to come
The history of the GDR is part of German history
For this reason, the F.D.P. believes that coming to terms with the history of the SED dictatorship is a national concern that affects citizens, associations, parties and the state in equal measure
As the first all-German party, the Liberals aim to neither forget nor suppress the period of Germany's division
Reparation for communist injustice is the top priority
Rehabilitating the victims of the SED regime of injustice will therefore continue to be an important task in the coming years
This must also involve giving a chance to those who, having previously served the perpetrators of dictatorship, now want to integrate themselves honestly into the democracy they have won
The F.D.P. is committed to carrying out an assessment in the coming legislative period of the German Bundestag as to whether the objectives set out in the Unification Treaty of August 31, 1990 for the restoration of private ownership of developed land and buildings that had to be given up during the GDR era due to over-indebtedness or the threat of over-indebtedness have been achieved
Existing obstacles to this legal policy objective must be removed
Effectively combating crime and violence
The inner peace of a society is based just as much on the freedom of its legal system as on the protection of the life, limb and property of its citizens
Crime is a violation of civilization which the constitutional state must oppose with all the means at its disposal
In particular, children and young people must be protected from physical and emotional neglect and abuse
The F.D.P. wants to make law and enforce law
It wants to do this in the interests of protecting citizens and safeguarding freedom
In this and the last legislative period, a large number of laws have been passed to close existing gaps and respond to new forms of crime: These include, for example
- the law on combating organized crime,
- a legal regulation to combat money laundering and to facilitate access to suspicious assets,
- the Act to Combat Sexual Offenses and Other Dangerous Crimes,
- the Crime Prevention Act,
- the Anti-Corruption Act,
- the law on the harmonization of penalties,
- the law to enable electronic home surveillance,
- Detention pending trial and accelerated proceedings
Despite more and more legal options for fighting crime, citizens' feelings of being under threat have not diminished
Politicians must provide an answer to this
We need special procedural arrangements that make it possible to prosecute offenders much faster and more effectively than before
The decriminalization of so-called ''petty offences'', for example, would be the wrong approach
The F.D.P. wants a reversal in internal security
It is no longer about the competition to keep inventing new laws or tightening up existing ones
This serves no one
The point is to enforce the existing law
We do not have a legislative deficit, but an enforcement deficit
Sufficient legal instruments are available for the prosecution of criminal offenses
They just need to be applied consistently and quickly
As the enforcement of existing laws is largely a matter for the federal states, the state governments must be repeatedly reminded that combating crime and ensuring internal security are among their core tasks
You are responsible for this
We need a police force that is better trained, better organized, better paid and better equipped
A police force that concentrates on its actual task, namely the protection of citizens
On the other hand, the F.D.P. rejects lowering the threshold for police intervention in the context of identity checks without suspicion
The gene file set up at the Federal Criminal Police Office must be protected against misuse by a criminal provision
The F.D.P. demands:
- modernization of judicial administrations,
- modernization of police administrations so that more police officers can be deployed in the field,
- inclusion of foreigners in the criminal investigation and protection police, -
better material, especially technical, equipment for the police,
- improvement of European cooperation through joint police exchange and training programs
The European police authority EUROPOL must be further developed
Legal protection for citizens by the European Court of Justice should be sought against interventions by EUROPOL officers
The state has a monopoly on the use of force
This must remain the case
The F.D.P. therefore rejects all considerations of transferring police tasks and powers to private security companies
Finally, it must be examined whether it is part of the general task of the police to guard and protect large-scale private events at the expense of the taxpayer
Internal security, however, is not exclusively a task of the state
If you want to fend off violence and breaches of the law, you also need a defensive society
The tacit acceptance of violence is the beginning of the end of an effective constitutional state
Civil courage and civil commitment are therefore the foundations of a society in which citizens feel safe
.D.P. advocates the increased creation of preventive councils in which citizens and the police work together for greater security
Furthermore, the Liberals want the principle of victim-offender mediation to be applied more intensively in order to emphasize the responsibility of the offender to make amends to the victim
Youth violence, child and juvenile delinquency
In addition to attacks on people and property, violence is also an attack on our constitutional state
This also and above all applies to acts of violence with a right-wing extremist and xenophobic background
Young people in particular are at risk of becoming increasingly violent, which has many causes
These include, above all, a lack of prospects, fear of social decline, a lack of trust in the ability of politicians to act, the loss of generally accepted values and the associated decline in the ability of families and schools to educate children and impart values
Outlawing all forms of violence is therefore a task for society as a whole
The F.D.P. wants to prevent the development of violence and crime, particularly through better education and training opportunities
Above all, we must convey to young people in our country that democracy and the rule of law form a system of values that guarantees individual freedom and social security and is worth standing up for
There are already sufficient legal instruments available for prosecuting criminal offenses committed by juveniles and adolescents
They just need to be applied consistently and quickly
The F.D.P. therefore rejects a tightening of the existing juvenile criminal law, in particular a lowering of the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12 years of age
In order to decisively counter the increase in juvenile delinquency, educational and social measures must be taken first and foremost as a preventative measure
Juvenile criminal law can and must only be the last resort to support them in this process
The children concerned must be helped by increased use of youth welfare services instead of criminal sanctions
In cases of conflict, it must also be possible to order educational support against the parents' will
The juvenile justice system must do better justice to its educational tasks
The F.D.P. is committed to the further development of the Juvenile Penitentiary System Act, which in particular gives greater weight to school and vocational training in prison
These measures must be accompanied by the payment of an appropriate wage and an appropriate training allowance
Protecting privacy - modern data protection
The general right of personality of the citizen is subject to increasing attacks
The F.D.P. therefore advocates improved protection of the general right of personality
Since the general right of personality is a fundamental right relating to the community, the individual must accept restrictions on this right in the overriding general interest
Insofar as data are processed electronically in the non-public sphere, particular importance must be attached to the protection of privacy In
this context, data protection law positions must not be used as a pretext
In the information society, data protection as a traditional right of defense against the state must be extended to a comparable extent to the relationship between private individuals In the
future, too, the protection of privacy must be safeguarded and expanded as an elementary component of our constitution and fundamental liberal convictions
The F.D.P. demands:
- The involvement of data protection commissioners in the further development of data protection and in the planning and regulation of data processing systems must be expanded
- Citizens' rights to information and consent in data processing must be further strengthened
- More transparency and better information for the citizens concerned about the nature and scope of data processing affecting them in all areas
- The constitutionally enshrined secrecy of telephone communications must be effectively protected and, in particular, data protection in modern telecommunications must be fully guaranteed
In particular, the surveillance of international calls, which enjoy virtually no protection, must be safeguarded by the rule of law
- No introduction of the ''major spying attack'' on homes, as it represents a disproportionate intrusion into citizens' privacy -
In the case of international data transfers and the development of international cooperation, it must be ensured that national data protection is not undermined by cross-border data networking systems
- Data protection legislation must keep pace with modern technological developments, especially in view of globalization
Integration instead of exclusion
In Germany, among the now 7 million foreigners, there are about 2 million who are younger than 20
This ratio alone makes clear the magnitude of the integration task for our society It is
therefore important to point out that it is not just a matter of giving young people better opportunities, but that it is in the interest of our German society as a whole to better integrate the children who are born here,
These children speak German and the language of their parents with a German accent at best It is
wrong to let these children grow up with a foreign consciousness instead of imparting a domestic identity to them from the very beginning
For in all probability they will always live in this country
Whoever rightly complains about ghettoization in the cities must prevent ghettoization in the minds
The F.D.P. demands:
- The citizenship law of the Federal Republic of Germany must be fundamentally amended
The right to obtain German citizenship at birth must be enshrined in law for foreigners of the second and subsequent generations born in the Federal Republic of Germany
We therefore want to introduce temporary dual citizenship for these children
Between the ages of 18 and 25, young people must make a final decision on one of the two nationalities
- In addition, the F.D.P. advocates the right to vote in local elections for all foreigners who have been legally resident in Germany for five years or more
The exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate by EU citizens in local elections at their place of residence must be promoted through better public relations work
- The F.D.P. opposes the restriction of foreign visitor traffic through excessive and bureaucratic creditworthiness requirements for guests and inviting parties
Better manage and control immigration
The F.D.P. advocates an open society,
which, however, determines the extent of its openness itself and subjects it to fixed rules
Anyone who comes to our country as an immigrant must know what prospects await them here until they become a naturalized citizen
Conversely, the native population is entitled to have its values and norms accepted by the immigrants in the same way as by themselves and that the decision on how many immigrants can come to us at all is not made without their participation
The F.D.P. therefore considers an overall concept of immigration and integration to be necessary, which must rest on two pillars - the legal control and limitation of immigration and the systematic integration of those who are able to immigrate
Therefore, the F.D.P. demands:
- For a controlled immigration policy, the rapid adoption of a legal regulation to control and limit immigration, as provided for in the Free Democrats' bill, is urgently required Immigration
must be controlled and limited Immigration
must be oriented more strongly to our own interests
This will benefit Germany in sociopolitical and economic terms
The F.D.P. doesnot want more immigration, but more control over immigration
Only an immigration limitation law creates the necessary predictability and thus the basis for successful integration
- Greater importance must be attached to learning the German language as the decisive factor in social participation The F.D.
P. therefore advocates appropriate consideration of German language skills in its concept for regulating immigration and facilitating naturalization
It also calls on foreign fellow citizens to make greater use of the existing range of language courses
Refugee Policy
Under the new asylum law of July 1, 1993, refugees from civil war zones seeking temporary protection in Germany are to be granted a residence status independent of the asylum procedure and with a temporary right to stay
The F.D.P. therefore calls on the federal and state governments to abandon the blockade of this regulation on the special status of civil war refugees and thus prevent civil war refugees from taking advantage of the asylum procedure not intended for them
Civil war refugees enjoy our temporary protection because of the situation in their homeland; However, they must return when the civil war situation no longer exists
Refugee policy concerns everyone
Therefore, the European Union, as a community of responsibility and peace, must immediately agree on a binding asylum and refugee policy that is valid throughout Europe
Its goal should be a fair distribution of responsibility and burdens within the European Union
Furthermore, the F.D.P. is infavor of improving in an appropriate form both the partly inhumane modalities of detention pending deportation and the handling of unaccompanied minor refugees
In addition, a legal provision must be made so that in cases of undue hardship deportation can
be refrained from Furthermore, it cannot be right that developing countries, which are obligated under international law to readmit their citizens who have committed crimes in Germany, permanently shirk this responsibility while at the same time expecting German development aid
Our partner states must fulfill their responsibility in this regard
In the event of a lack of cooperation, the option of reducing or canceling development aid funds must be used consistently
State liability
The state must provide compensation for the damage it causes
Therefore, the confusing and fragmented state liability law must be regulated uniformly in East and West
The state's acknowledgement of its responsibility is an essential contribution to strengthening the citizen's trust in the state's actions
New technologies, law and ethics
Technological progress has greatly improved life in the world from generation to generation
Technology should also be allowed to develop in the future
The opportunities it offers far outweigh the risks
Without rapid technological progress, many more people would die of hunger
It would be highly antisocial to hold back technological development
Our standard of living should also be allowed to continue to rise, e.g. in terms of medicine, nutrition, energy supply, transport links and communication
National and international legislation and treaty-making must ensure that technological progress is in harmony with human rights,
human dignity
and the preservation of the environment
Biotechnology is developing into one of the most important key technologies worldwide
The F.D.P. welcomes this development and supports it
For example, the EU Biotechnology Directive should be adopted and implemented in Germany, whereby the Federal Republic of Germany has the right to maintain and expand its more far-reaching national protection standards at any time
However, the development also harbors risks
The emergence of technologies such as mammalian cloning raises fundamental ethical questions
There must be clear boundaries for research and science here
In particular, the strict ban on human cloning must be maintained
In addition, the F.D.P. is committed to safeguarding human rights in the application of biology and medicine, including internationally
It therefore welcomes the objectives of the Council of Europe's Biomedicine Convention
This makes the standards of protection of human rights and human dignity binding for all accession states
This will help to raise awareness that there are ethical and legal limits to research
Raising this awareness is particularly important for many countries that do not yet have adequate legal standards for the limits of biomedical research
Germany must set an example for the international community by joining the EU
The Federal Republic of Germany will maintain the protection standards applicable in Germany, especially if these exceed the protection level of the Biomedicine Convention
Animal welfare
''Animals shall be protected from avoidable suffering and harm within the framework of the applicable laws.''
With this formulation, which is to supplement Article 20a of the German Basic Law, a meaningful legal balancing of the interests of animal protection and freedom of research will continue to be possible
The F.D.P. wants to achieve in this way that animal protection is finally given constitutional status
Churches and religious communities
Christian and Jewish religion have decisively shaped history, culture and ethical awareness in Europe
The Enlightenment and our European concept of human rights have their roots in these religions
The churches are doing groundbreaking work in the charitable sector
The commitment to personal freedom of faith and conscience inseparably implies that the work of the churches must be safeguarded not only within the church, but also in society
The fundamental right to freedom of belief and conscience requires equal treatment of all citizens in the areas of legislation, jurisdiction and administration
Therefore, the state, bound by the Basic Law, must behave in an ideologically - religiously neutral manner
Belonging or not belonging to a religious or ideological community must not entail any advantages or disadvantages in the state sphere
In this understanding, liberal politics advocates the mutual independence of the state and religious communities
The aim is to keep the space free in which the churches and other religious communities can fulfill their tasks according to their own self-image
However, this does not apply to associations such as Scientology, which claim to be religious communities but in reality disregard human dignity or attempt to undermine the rule of law
According to the liberal understanding of law and freedom, such associations cannot claim the protection of Article 4 of the Basic Law
How the relationship between church and state is organized in a free state must be reconsidered and redefined from time to time
To this end, the F.D.P. seeks open and objective discussions with the churches and other religious and ideological communities
As early as 1974, it created the basis for this with its theses ''Free Church in a Free State''
Many of the demands made there are still highly topical
General employment law should apply to church employees who work outside the religious core area
Liberal business law
Liberal legal policy must face up to the requirements of the globalization of economic competition
The increasing internationalization of competition must be seen as a challenge and, above all, as an opportunity for German companies and their performance
National overregulation that restricts the competitiveness and innovative strength of our companies must be abolished
At the same time, the German capital market must be made more attractive for international investors through deregulation and liberalization
Only in this way will Germany be able to strengthen its position as an international financial center
Central reform projects (in particular the reform of commercial and transport law as well as the reform of stock corporation and accounting law) were realized in the 13th legislative period for deregulation
For example, the access of our internationally active companies to foreign capital markets has been significantly improved by allowing German companies to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards within the framework of applicable Community law
The path of internationalization of our commercial law with simultaneous deregulation must be consistently continued
The F.D.P. demands:
- The long-standing efforts to create a European Company must be brought to a successful conclusion
Germany must no longer stand in the way of an appropriate solution because of the co-determination issue
- The same applies to the opening up of cross-border mergers and the transfer of registered offices within the European Union, which will help to optimize the opportunities for action in a single economic and monetary area
- The efforts to achieve a uniform European takeover law are to be supported
Effective voluntary commitments by German industry must be given priority over legislative measures
- To strengthen the competitiveness of our internationally operating companies, further harmonization of international and German group accounting standards is necessary
- The German capital market must be broadened and opened up to more companies
This includes facilitating the conversion of limited liability companies (GmbHs) into small stock corporations and their possible subsequent listing on the stock exchange
Constitutional barriers for the modest state
The strength of a state does not depend on the extent of its state activity, but on the consent of its citizens to their state
To ensure that disenchantment with politics does not turn into disenchantment with the state, the F.D.P. is calling for constitutional barriers against excessive state activity
Among other things, the F.D.P. wants the ban on new borrowing to be enshrined in the constitution,
a constitutional requirement for an upper limit for the total burden of taxes and duties on citizens to one third of their income,
a privatization requirement for the federal government, federal states and municipalities
and a constitutionally enshrined two-thirds majority for the introduction of new taxes or levies
The task of liberal policy is to strengthen the scope for individual freedom
The tasks of the state must therefore be limited to what is necessary
They must be regulated in clear, comprehensible standards that are easy for citizens to understand
Service management must replace cumbersome administrative bureaucracy
Privatization, deregulation and the reduction of bureaucracy serve to align state services more closely with the needs of citizens
Especially in the information society, it is essential to redefine the limits of state activity
That is why the F.D.P. is calling for a lean state!
We need more privatization
- The state is the worse entrepreneur
Therefore, with the exception of narrowly defined sovereign tasks, public services should generally be privatized
However, switching to a private legal form is not yet a sufficient genuine privatization
- At the federal level, the F.D.P. pushed through the privatization of the postal service, telecommunications and Lufthansa
Federal shareholdings must be sold within five years
In addition, the focus must be on the privatization of internal administrative services
This ranges from construction management to the management of technical equipment such as data processing networks
- Privatization at state and municipal level must be stepped up
This also includes the privatization of the Landesbanken
We need more deregulation
- The constant flood of standards against civil freedom and entrepreneurial spirit in business and society must be stopped
The F.D.P. has succeeded in ensuring that not only a needs test but also an efficiency test is carried out before new laws are passed
The cost implications of laws must now be detailed
These measures must be pursued consistently
This applies in particular to bureaucratic costs for the state, citizens and companies
- In future, laws and ordinances involving expenditure will require a precise end date to be specified
All commitments entered into may not run beyond this date
Thereafter, a completely new resolution is required if the law or regulation is to continue to apply
Without a time limit, temporary aid becomes a permanent subsidy
- Administrative procedures must be simplified
The F.D.P. has already removed a number of barriers to investment
Nevertheless, the procedures must become even faster and less bureaucratic
- There are deficits in deregulation, particularly in substantive law
They restrict the scope of action of citizens and the economy
Existing laws must therefore be systematically and consistently reviewed for their necessity, simplified and, if necessary, repealed
Making public service flexible
The F.D.P. upholds the institution of the professional civil service
However, not every government task has to be performed by civil servants
In future, the deployment of civil servants must be restricted to sovereign activities
The F.D.P. succeeded in ensuring that the Civil Service Law Reform Act, which came into force on July 1, 1997, promotes the mobility and flexibility of civil servants, emphasizes the concept of performance in civil service law more clearly and reforms civil service law as a whole
Civil servants' pensions are burdened by the same developments as statutory pension insurance
Reform is unavoidable if the system as a whole is not to be jeopardized
It is also a question of social justice to treat statutory pensions and retirement pensions in the same way
The pension obligations entered into by the state today already threaten to become the debts and taxes of tomorrow
That is why the state must make provisions today for the pension burdens of tomorrow
The state must make provisions for pensions every time a civil servant is appointed for life
Pension funds at federal, state and local level prevent the current generation from burdening the next generation with the financing of their welfare state
Making judicial protection more effective
Without a functioning judiciary, the rule of law cannot develop its peacemaking function
The constitutionally guaranteed protection of the law includes that decisions are made by independent courts in a legally defined procedure within a reasonable period of time
The citizen therefore has a right not only to fair, but also to timely judgments
In order to meet this requirement, the F.D.P. demands:
- not to cut judicial budgets,
- to improve the internal organization and equipment of courts and prosecutors' offices by the state judicial administrations,
- to promote out-of-court dispute resolution and generally revise the law on costs,
- to reform the appellate system in order to shorten the duration of proceedings.
New federalism
Federal and state governments block each other on important reforms
However, our state must remain capable of acting and federalism must be strengthened
The state must become leaner at all its levels of action
We want to enforce the principle of competition in the political system through decentralization and a clear distribution of competencies between the federal, state and local governments
In the long term, the increase in scope for action in such a competitive federalism also offers great opportunities for the economically weaker regions
The political decision-making processes as well as the distribution of tasks and their financing at federal and state level must be unbundled to the benefit of both sides
This also includes reducing the current 600-plus coordinating bodies of the federal and state executive and shifting decisions back to the parliaments
The federal states should be granted more autonomy, but less authority in federal legislation
To this end, the F.D.P. is seeking an amendment to the Basic Law
Following the reduction in the size of the Bundestag, a reduction in the size of the state parliaments and local parliaments should also be sought
Administrative structures must be made more effective at all levels
The number of ministries must be further reduced at federal level
Office and mandate must be kept separate,
Parliamentary state secretaries to be abolished
The number of federal employees has fallen
States and municipalities should examine where staff can be saved in their administrations
A new federalism needs a new financial constitution
It is intended to allocate the federal government, the federal states and the municipalities their own taxes and give them the opportunity to determine the amount of their tax revenue and thus the burden on their citizens themselves within the constitutionally prescribed framework
Clear separation of fiscal sovereignty and financing between the federal and state governments also creates clear political responsibilities
The new financial constitution presupposes that the responsibility of the various levels for the individual political tasks is more clearly defined
The F.D.P. wants a reform of the fiscal equalization system that maintains the principle of solidarity between the economically strong and the weak states, but provides more incentives for successful economic policy, budgetary solidity and spending discipline on the part of the states
The current fiscal equalization system penalizes the economically successful countries and provides little incentive to exploit their own tax sources
We expect the new financial constitution to create more competition between the individual local authorities
and, above all, an increased interest on the part of citizens to have a more direct say than before in the level of their tax burden through their vote
Strengthening local self-government
The F.D.P. is committed to strengthening local self-government
For liberals, local self-government means strengthening the independence of local authorities vis-à-vis the EU, the federal government and the states
The F.D.P. demands:
- A redefinition of the relationship between the federal government, federal states and municipalities and, at the same time, better protection of the inviolable core area of local self-government in the constitution
Local self-government is more important than equality of living conditions
- Municipal legislation may only be created with the involvement of the municipalities
The municipal umbrella organizations are to be involved in federal and state legislation in good time where it affects municipal interests
Federal laws are to be subjected to a ''municipal impact assessment''
Additional state tasks may only be passed on to the municipalities if the necessary financial resources are also provided
- Securing the financial independence of local authorities is essential
Municipal self-government can only be secured in the long term with comprehensive municipal financial reform
Mixed financing should be abolished and local authorities should be given more fiscal sovereignty
Municipalities must be able to cover their individual financial requirements through independent sources of revenue
This requires both securing its own forms of financing that it can influence itself and a financial equalization system for the federal states that can be calculated in the long term
- State standards and requirements that are not absolutely necessary, particularly for the design of construction projects, are to be removed in order to strengthen local self-administration and decision-making powers
- The planning sovereignty of the municipalities is an essential principle of self-administration
Municipal development planning should address the justified demands of citizens with regard to the quality of their environment, their living and housing conditions and translate them into concrete, location-oriented development goals
- The Federal Government and the Länder must ensure that the self-administration of the municipalities remains guaranteed in a united Europe
The F.D.P. believes it is necessary to institutionally safeguard the municipalities as self-governing bodies - and not just the federal states and regions of Europe - and to grant them participation rights where municipal concerns are affected
Liberal Legal Policy for the European Union
We want to continue to shape Europe according to our liberal and constitutional principles
This is a central challenge for the F.D.P.'s legal policy
We must ensure that all the constitutional achievements that liberal-democratic politics has achieved and fought for in Germany in the past also retain their position in a modern Europe
fundamental pillars of our constitutional state must not be shaken
We need not only a Europe of constitutional states, but a Europe that is governed by the rule of law in every respect
The F.D.P. demands:
- We want a European constitution with a catalog of fundamental rights
This constitution should be drawn up by the European Parliament, approved by an assembly appointed for this purpose and legitimized by a referendum in all Member States
- The European Union should accede to the European Convention on Human Rights as soon as possible in order to ensure that fundamental rights are safeguarded throughout the Community
- Cooperation between the Member States in the areas of justice and home affairs must be strengthened and simplified through more effective procedures close to the citizens
The communitarization of the area of ''mutual assistance in civil matters'' on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty is a good example of the fact that closer cooperation is possible
- Care must be taken to ensure that, when the Schengen ''aquis'' is transferred to the third pillar of the European Union, the data protection provisions of the 1990 Schengen Supplementary Convention are transferred without restriction
V. Information society and media
Information Society
Modern information and communication technologies are fundamentally changing the society in which we live, learn and work
The traditional industrial society was characterized by centrality, standardization and hierarchies
The information society demands creativity, decentralization, participation, small units and personal, independent performance
The information society thus corresponds to liberal ideas on the one hand and at the same time challenges citizens to shape it in a liberal way
Liberals want to create the conditions to responsibly exploit the opportunities of the information society
After all, it is not the development of new technologies that poses the greatest risk, but the abandonment of them
The information society is not an opportunity that can or cannot be seized, but rather a challenge that must be faced in order to secure freedom, prosperity and jobs
Only with a market-based regulatory framework can the risks be minimized and the opportunities for more freedom, prosperity and work consistently exploited
Politicians must act now, because the transformation to an information society is taking place faster, more radically and more globally than all previous technological upheavals, and it is irreversible
The F.D.P. demands:
- Regulation that harms competition and thus Germany as a business location must be consistently eliminated
More and new jobs are created through competition, free from state monopolies, private concentration of power and opaque ownership structures
- The development of modern forms of communication in Germany must not be hampered by new financial burdens for users and providers of modern communication technologies
The F.D.P. rejects a fee levied by the GEZ for Internet-capable PCs as well as a flat-rate user fee for Internet users
This also applies in particular to the data volume-dependent levy (so-called "bit tax")
- Market entry for smaller network providers must be facilitated
License fees must not become an insurmountable hurdle for smaller providers; they must be limited to the processing costs of the license application
- Approval procedures must be further shortened and reduced because three quarters of sales in information technology are generated with products that are less than two years old
It must be possible to translate research findings into marketable products and services immediately
- Research funding must focus on innovations in basic research and on new technologies with broad application possibilities
- We need a course correction in education and training
Education and training must enable people to acquire new knowledge for themselves
In future, the use of information technologies will be one of the basic cultural techniques, just like reading, writing and arithmetic
Young people should learn how to deal correctly and sensibly with the flood of information available to them
Finding, selecting, compiling, linking and evaluating information are becoming increasingly important learning objectives
A practice-oriented offer for training in multimedia techniques is also necessary in vocational education and training
- Learning for the information society and learning with the means of the information society must begin in schools
Every young person must be guaranteed access to information technology through the public education system
Schools must be equipped with the necessary facilities, school networks should be set up and/or existing data networks should be able to be used free of charge
The opportunities offered by private sponsorship should also be utilized to a greater extent
- The foundations for media literacy must be laid at pre-school age
The use of media, supported by interactive learning programs, must be more strongly integrated into our education system
- Public administrations must take advantage of opportunities to get closer to citizens
Communication between citizens and administrations can become faster, cheaper and more direct: Forms must be available and accepted by computer
New technologies must be used to speed up the flow of information within the administration
Citizens' consultation hours should be offered on the Internet
Public information, e.g. invitations, printed matter and minutes of public meetings and invitations to tender must be accessible online for 24 hours
Citizens must also be given the opportunity to submit tax returns via the new media
- E-mails are to be treated like letter post
Just like the secrecy of letters, there must be a secrecy of e-mails
Modern encryption technologies (cryptography) enable the transmission of information without the network operator or third parties being able to view it
The F.D.P. rejects a ban on cryptography and the obligation to deposit keys with government agencies
- The first judgments against German Internet providers for aiding and abetting criminal offenses require a review of the relevant legal situation if Germany does not want to say goodbye to this global and incredibly dynamic information technology due to abuse (also from outside the scope of German law)
- The legal requirements for digital signatures and the establishment of a corresponding information technology security infrastructure organized by the private sector must be created at European and international level
- We need a worldwide copyright law
The treaties with the WTO (World Trade Organization) and WIPO (World Intellectual Property Rights Organization) must be extended accordingly
Within the framework of the Copyright Act, the concept of the public domain in particular must be redefined so that the transmission of protected works and performances intended for several unconnected recipients is deemed to be in the public domain
- Authors and performers should also receive appropriate remuneration for the digital use of their works and performances
To this end, the system of the collecting society for words and the collecting society for images must also be transferred to the use of the new forms of communication
Growth market communication
The media and communications industry is gaining increasing economic importance as a growth sector
The F.D.P., as the reform party, sees this structural change as an opportunity and a challenge to make Germany even more attractive as a business location and more competitive internationally
Liberal communications policy must at the same time ensure the diversity of information and the plurality of opinions
Dual broadcasting system
The F.D.P. is clearly in favor of the dual broadcasting system
The complementary offerings of public and private broadcasting are excellently suited to satisfy the individual information, education and entertainment needs of listeners and viewers
Public broadcasting
The F.D.P. demands:
- Public broadcasting is to be organized free of advertising and sponsorship in clear distinction to private broadcasting
This will make public broadcasters less dependent on audience ratings and enable them to better fulfill their actual functional mandate
Public service broadcasting must guarantee the basic service required by the Federal Constitutional Court
As part of the universal service, ARD and ZDF should be given the opportunity to offer a certain amount of special-interest programming and to present offerings in the field of new media
The focus on culture, education, science and training also includes telelearning and teleteaching through multimedia as well as teleworking
- One of the most important tasks of high-quality public service broadcasting is to safeguard and further develop forms of presentation and genres that have no place in privately organized broadcasting and would disappear without public service broadcasting's own production efforts
These include television dramas, features and documentaries
- Public service broadcasting should remain a matter for the federal states
The federal states must ensure that public broadcasters are not unilaterally favored in journalistic competition with private program providers and that they use the funds received from fee payers sparingly
- The third programs must be preserved as carriers of regional and cultural identity
- Broadcasters of the federal states should merge more strongly
and show local conditions through local windows
Broadcasting supervision and program control
The rights of citizens as broadcasting participants and as objects of reporting must be strengthened
State and government offices are incompatible with membership in broadcasting supervisory bodies
Each party represented in the respective state parliament at faction strength should only be able to send one representative to the supervisory bodies of the respective state
The representatives sent by other socially relevant groups may not be members of state parliaments or the Bundestag
Private broadcasting
Private broadcasting is first and foremost an economic asset and therefore important for Germany as a business location
The F.D.P. demands:
- Federal legislative responsibility for the entire private media sector, including private broadcasters
The previous tasks of the state media authorities should be taken over by an independent supervisory authority
- The abolition of advertising regulations for private broadcasters at national and European level The
broadcasters should be able to decide independently on the scope and placement of advertising spots
Depictions of violence in programs
In view of the increase in depictions of violence in both public and private television programs, more effective protection of minors is necessary
The F.D.P. demands:
- Television broadcasters should be obliged to indicate before their programs whether they are suitable for children, for young people and from what age, or only for adults
The program codes should also be made available for the electronic control of TV sets
- The advance notices for feature films and series should not contain any scenes of violence in the early evening program
- Children must be enabled as early as possible to deal critically with television and, in particular, to distinguish television from reality
This must begin as early as the first primary school classes
Independence of the press/personal rights
The state has the task of creating framework conditions so that publishers and journalists can maintain their independence
and the dignity of the individual is preserved in reporting
The F.D.P. demands:
- The rights of journalists vis-à-vis law enforcement authorities must be improved
Editorial secrecy and the protection of journalistic informants must be strengthened
The confiscation of editorial/journalistic material is only justifiable in cases of serious crime if the crimes could not otherwise be solved
- The possibilities of civil law claims by citizens for injunctive relief, revocation and compensation are to be made clearer and more effective
- Dirigiste advertising bans, such as the ban on tobacco advertising adopted by the EU health ministers, must be reversed as quickly as possible
- The subsidization of the postal newspaper service for newspaper and magazine publishers should be phased out
The opening up of the postal monopoly should be seen as an opportunity to develop our own and more cost-effective forms of distribution
- Disclosure of shareholdings in the publishing industry must be increased
- The protection of tendencies under works constitution law is retained
The F.D.P. rejects legally prescribed editorial statutes
Fixed book prices and value added tax
Ensuring the diversity and quality of German-language publishing products is of particular concern to the F.D.P. as a cultural party
The F.D.P. demands:
- The retention of the reduced VAT rate for all publishing products, as this is an indispensable element for cost-effective costing
- The retention of fixed book prices, without which there would demonstrably be fewer titles, fewer publishers and fewer bookstores
Despite EU regulations, a fixed retail price must remain possible for books in related language areas by means of cross-border agreements
VI. ecological market economy and market-based ecology
Protecting the natural foundations of life for future generations is one of the top priorities for liberals
Under the conditions of a market economy, the FDP has achieved a great deal for environmental protection in more than 25 years since the Freiburg Theses
Many air pollutants have been reduced, our rivers and lakes have become cleaner, the quantities of waste to be disposed of have been significantly reduced, and there is no longer any talk of a waste emergency
The regulatory framework has essentially been set: Whatis needed now is its streamlining and simplification,
an improvement in enforcement,
and a comprehensive, interdepartmental strategy
Our guiding principle is sustainable future-compatible development that further reduces ecological burdens and increases resource productivity
The FDP relies on
- more personal responsibility and less bureaucracy,
- reliability and planning security,
- cost reduction through efficiency improvement and innovation The
ECOMADE IN GERMANY brand stands for new products and processes, which, if pursued with determination, will also create new jobs.
This can and will only happen
- with a consistent ecological market economy that activates market forces,
- with an ecological inventory for Germany that analyzes weak points and derives targets, and
- by integrating environmental policy requirements into all relevant planning and decision-making processes at an early stage.
More environmental protection through market instruments
What is required is a new ecological strategy that concentrates on the essential problem areas
The effects on the environment must be related to the use of resources and the effects on jobs
This is a demanding management task for politics and business alike
We rely primarily on the individual responsibility of citizens and business instead of state regulations
Modern environmental management has proven itself in numerous companies; the state must learn more from the private sector
This means for the F.D.P. concretely:
- Use competition for more efficient and cost-effective solutions, e.g. in the planning, construction and operation of municipal wastewater disposal plants
- Breaking up monopolies and improving market opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises through open markets, e.g. in the waste and energy sector
- Achieving environmental goals with new instruments such as tradable environmental usage rights in competition for the best solution
- More voluntary commitments and agreements, fewer laws and regulations, e.g. on fleet consumption by car manufacturers
- Strengthening personal responsibility through eco-audit systems in companies
- Reduction of ecologically absurd benefits
- As part of the tax reduction reform, the F.D.P. is in favor of a third VAT rate on energy consumption if it is introduced uniformly throughout Europe
Otherwise, it places a one-sided burden on German citizens and consumers in Europe
However, the F.D.P. makes it a condition for a third VAT rate on energy that the revenue from this is used exclusively for the simultaneous further reduction of tax rates for wage and income tax and corporation tax
Environmental protection understood in this way creates jobs and does not endanger any
The F.D.P. rejects ideologically motivated environmental hysteria and the blanket demonization of certain substances and technologies
Nature conservation without paternalism
Nature conservation must not be limited to thinking in terms of reserves
Nature conservation is the protection of our homeland;
the diverse ecologically valuable cultural landscapes, as they were shaped by agriculture, must also be preserved
The F.D.P. does not want to achieve nature conservation against agriculture and forestry, but with agriculture and forestry
The ideology with which humans are sometimes excluded from national parks, even though humans have transformed nature into a cultural landscape in Germany over centuries, contradicts nature conservation as we understand it
Nature conservation must be shaped with people and not against them
Wherever possible, contractual nature conservation should therefore take precedence over official orders It is
not only the nature conservation authorities and environmental associations that have a responsibility for the conservation of nature and species, but all those who deal with it
.D.P. advocates a right of action for nature conservation associations in federal proceedings as well
Nature needs an advocate
Experience in the German states shows that this does not result in procedural delays, but rather that the interests of nature conservation are better taken into account in advance during planning
The EU's nature conservation legislation must be implemented consistently
Reduce bureaucracy - strengthen personal responsibility
The prerequisites for accelerating and simplifying approval procedures have been created by law
This acceleration potential must now be exploited everywhere on the ground
Through an environmental code, the F.D.P. wants to Atransparent and systematic environmental policy in Germany
By strengthening federal competence in environmental protection legislation, a uniform federal framework is to be created
Today's implementation of laws in the states, which is often overly detailed and ideologically based, will thus be reduced, as will ultimately unnecessary administrative costs
The F.D.P. is committed to relieving those companies that introduce environmental management on the basis of the EU Eco-Audit Regulation or a comparable international standard of their reporting obligations, verification procedures and controls
Reducing costs for environmental protection in the municipality
The F.D.P. advocates more market economy also in municipal environmental protection in order to get the locally partly high fees under control.
These include:
- Modern forms of organization that allow a business management approach
- Economic efficiency competitions as early as the creation of wastewater and waste concepts,
- private-sector operator and service models put out to tender under competitive conditions,
- Decentralized wastewater concepts in rural regions instead of concentrating on large, expensive central sewage treatment plants,
- Cutting back on excessively detailed regulations in order to provide more scope for more cost-effective solutions adapted to local conditions,
- the tax equality of privately and publicly organized waste management companies
The declining volumes of waste must not lead to the federal states and municipal companies forcing their way into the markets of the private waste management industry through state obligations to sell or subsidized prices
Local overcapacities at waste incineration plants should be avoided through regional cooperation
In order to avoid the contaminated sites of tomorrow, the F.D.P. is in favor of allowing municipal waste to be landfilled after thermal pre-treatment in accordance with the requirements of the TA-Siedlungsabfall (Technical Instructions on Municipal Waste)
Even with declining waste volumes, the F.D.P. is committed to further waste avoidance through a high proportion of reusable packaging in order to conserve resources
Instead of rigid quotas, the F.D.P. advocates the introduction of tradable licenses (e.g. for beverage cans)
Reduce immissions through better technology and less traffic
Although air quality in Germany has improved considerably, there is still a need for action, particularly with regard to traffic-related emissions
To this end, the F.D.P. relies on technical efficiency improvements and modern transportation systems such as:
- the earliest possible introduction of fuels with a further reduced sulphur and benzene content (maximum 50 ppm sulphur and maximum 1 % benzene),
- the reduction of fuel consumption (target: three-liter car) and the development of alternative emission-free drive systems such as fuel cells,
- reducing traffic flows by combining residential and working areas and using modern communication and logistics systems,
- the apportionment of vehicle tax to mineral oil tax,
- the conversion of the taxable mileage allowance into a distance allowance independent of the means of transportation
The fight against noise, especially traffic noise, must be intensified through technical measures for trucks and cars as well as for road surfaces and tracks
The population must be relieved of aircraft noise by ''whisper jets''
New, more flexible instruments, such as noise license models for airports and noise abatement concepts, must also be introduced
Assuming responsibility worldwide
Our responsibility for future generations obliges us to pursue an international environmental policy as an integral part of foreign and development policy
The foundations of human life are threatened by climate change, water scarcity and soil degradation
All states must create the conditions for sustainable development on their own responsibility
Germany must continue to support them in this endeavor through an active foreign policy
The success of the Montreal Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer shows how important concrete international agreements are
The F.D.P. is committed to this,
- to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through global trade in emission rights and the implementation of reduction commitments with developing countries (joint implementation),
- to agree on an international forest convention that commits all states to sustainable forest management, - to
agree on an international soil protection convention to secure the food basis for the growing world population,
- to develop efficient instruments for the protection of the oceans, inparticular to stop the overfishing of the oceans
In addition to an international convention against overfishing, this includes
seals of approval for gentle fishing methods and voluntary commitments by major retail chains
- that the dumping of waste and pollutants of all kinds, in particular the dumping of chemicals and the dumping of nuclear waste into the oceans is banned and outlawed worldwide,
- to treat genetic resources as the natural wealth of the entire world and to allow the countries of origin to share in the economic benefits from their use
The F.D.P. demands a binding obligation under international law for all UN member states, with sanction mechanisms, to refrain from and prevent significant impairments of the livelihoods of other states
All contracting states must submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in The Hague in the event of disputes concerning the obligation to protect international livelihoods
Climate protection and resource conservation
Out of responsibility for future generations, we must minimize the risks of changing the world's climate
and end the waste of fossil fuels through sustainable economic activity
Therefore, the F.D.P. demands :
- the exhaustion of all potentials (technology options) that serve the goals of climate protection and resource conservation without harming the economy and jobs,
and the further development of unconventional approaches to solutions such as the avoidance and recycling of CO2 (e.g.through product extraction from algae),
- the introduction of tradable CO2 emission rights in Germany and the EU, by the start of international commitments in 2008,
- the reduction of CO2 emissions in Germany by 25% by 2005 compared to 1990, - the
fulfillment of voluntary commitments by industry, -
a non-taxation of the energetic use of bio-gas,
- the extension of the ''energy check-up'' to all buildings, to make better use of the high climate protection potential in the building sector
An energy passport creates transparency about ancillary costs and increases the market opportunities for energy-optimized buildings,
- to change the tax framework in such a way that innovative, decentralized energy supply concepts using renewable energies and the energy optimization of buildings are favored, - to make the
cost-effective low-energy house the standard,
- to make the public sector a role model for climate protection in its buildings.
Energy policy for the future
A national energy consensus on the use of different energy sources, on increased efforts to save energy and on the increased use of renewable energies is necessary in order to achieve the goal of a long-term, secure, efficient and ecologically sustainable energy supply, including successful CO2 reduction
The option for the peaceful use of nuclear energy must be kept open
However, the question of the continued use of nuclear energy as a transitional energy source must not be treated in isolation from issues of waste disposal, reactor safety, the CO2 problem and long-term security of supply
An attempt must be made to develop and introduce a strategy for climate and resource protection that can also be successful without the use of nuclear energy
Favorable conditions for nuclear energy, such as liability limitations, must be dismantled as quickly as possible
Responsibility for future generations demands that the further development of safety technology and the orderly disposal of existing nuclear power plants be ensured under national responsibility
The F.D.P. is committed to decisively strengthening measures to save energy, increase energy efficiency and make greater use of renewable energies in order to achieve the goals of the German Bundestag's Enquete Commission (50% renewable energies by 2050) by promoting research and market introduction
VII For a liberal transport policy
Mobility is a prerequisite for the competitiveness of the regions and our high quality of life and creates more freedom for personal lifestyle choices
Pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and public transport users must not be played off against each other
For the F.D.P., all modes of transport have equal rights
The infrastructure and maintenance costs caused by the individual modes of transport must be allocated to them in line with their revenues
The environmental compatibility of the means of transport must also be reflected in the cost burden
The F.D.P. sees the common European transport policy as an opportunity to make transport cost-effective, environmentally friendly, safe and efficient
Road traffic
The majority of transport services in Europe and Germany are provided by road
The Liberals are therefore opposed to discrimination against road transport
The F.D.P. demands:
- Comprehensive introduction of modern, efficient traffic management and information systems (telematics)
- The construction of new roads must not be taboo, especially if expansion measures are not sufficient to accommodate the increasing volume of traffic
When public funds are scarce, new ways of financing must be sought in order to mobilize private capital
An independent government commission is to develop new models for this purpose
- In future, the journey to and from work is to be taken into account for tax purposes by means of a distance allowance, irrespective of the means of transport used
- The impact of road traffic on citizens and the environment must be reduced
These include new, stricter limit values for noise and exhaust gases, specifications for reducing energy consumption, as well as active and passive protective measures
- Road safety must be further improved, e.g. by better educating road users, including about technical changes
Rail transport
We promote competitive and efficient rail transport
and are committed to shifting more traffic from road to the environmentally friendly railways
The main focus here is on the regionalization of local rail passenger transport,
the opening or access of the publicly operated railroad structure for third parties as transport operators
and rapid harmonization of the technical and economic framework conditions for rail transport in Europe
Participation of private capital in the railroad companies or the associated service companies must be made possible
So-called ''freeways'' are to be developed separately for passenger and freight traffic where it makes economic sense and is necessary for capacity reasons, as the technical requirements for high-speed lines are more complex and therefore more expensive than for pure freight traffic
The rail reform must be continued consistently
The conditions for a complete privatization of DB-AG and its subsidiaries in the medium term must be created,
However, responsibility and ownership of the network should remain with the state
The F.D.P. will continue to support the further development of the Transrapid transportation system in the future
Public transport (ÖPNV)
The F.D.P. wants public transport to be fully regionalized, because local transport services can only be provided in a customer-oriented manner under municipal responsibility
In addition to the provisions of the Regionalization Act, the federal government's responsibility must extend to research and development and to funding in structurally weak areas
The linking of public transport with rail transport, individual road transport and other transport systems must be established
More competition and improved access for third parties are also needed in public transport
The F.D.P. believes that better links with long-distance transport through the use of telematics are urgently needed
Shipping and ports
The ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport with the most favorable space and energy requirements per transported ton
The F.D.P. therefore supports all projects that lead to a sensible shift of traffic to the sea and inland waterways (''Road/Rail-to-Sea'')
The F.D.P. demands:
- Harmonization of shipping policy, in particular fiscal burdens in Europe, including a general reduction of all subsidies, on the basis of international agreements with the major shipping nations
The taxation of shipping is to be converted to a progressive tonnage tax
All secondary registers in Europe are to be transferred to a standardized ship register in order to prevent distortions of competition
- Demand-driven increase in the capacity of transport infrastructure in maritime and inland waterway transport, in particular improved links with rail and truck transport
Radial development of hinterland connections and better networking of German seaports with each other must be given special consideration in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan
This also applies to the seaward access roads
- In the future, priority should be given to the development of freight transport centers (GVZ) that have both sufficient infrastructure (road and rail connections, inland waterway connections) and a logistics system
GVZ should preferably be privately financed and operated
- A European initiative to harmonize and define binding technical standards and associated guidelines for access to European ports and waterways in order to further increase safety on the seas, rivers and canals and reduce energy consumption
Air traffic
A highly industrialized country needs an efficient air transport system
This also includes an efficient network of regional airports
Connecting major airports to the high-speed rail network increases the mobility of citizens
The cross-border nature of air traffic requires a coordinated policy at European level
We therefore reject further national subsidization of air traffic
The efficiency of European air traffic control must be increased through uniform norms and standards
To reduce the impact on people and the environment, it is necessary to create incentives for the use of particularly low-noise aircraft
The F.D.P. demands the complete privatization of the airport companies
VIII. Housing and urban development
Liberal housing policy since 1990 has led to an unprecedented level of diversity throughout the country
More apartments and a differentiated supply are the best way to protect tenants
Home ownership increases the quality of life, provides security for the future and relieves pressure on the housing market
Decisive steps have already been taken in recent years with the Home Ownership Allowance Act, the improved child building allowance and the promotion of building society savings
In the new federal states, new housing construction and the modernization of the housing stock are a success of liberal housing policy
Enabling young families to own their own home is a particular concern of the F.D.P., because a smart property policy is part of family policy
This is why the F.D.P. is calling for social housing construction to be geared primarily towards the creation of home ownership, over and above what has already been achieved
Traditional social housing construction has considerable shortcomings, e.g. 42% of properties are not occupied, costs are far too high, there is insufficient flexibility, etc.!
What is needed is a change of direction with the aim of using market-based incentives and the cooperation of private landlords and local authorities to put an end to the social scandal of mass under-occupancy and to provide those who need help with affordable housing in an unbureaucratic manner
Housing policy must set the framework conditions for a sufficient supply of housing
First and foremost, this includes a sufficient supply of affordable building land and the redevelopment and development of brownfield sites in cities, which is facilitated by the Soil Protection Act
The prerequisite for the development of building land is primarily political decisions at municipal, but also at regional and supra-regional level
The F.D.P. will advocate an offensive building land policy at all levels here
The modernization of old buildings will be the focus of state housing policy in the coming years
It enhances the quality of life and preserves the beauty of our towns and villages
In the new federal states in particular, cities must once again become centers of trade and services
The F.D.P. will work to ensure that the necessary aid is made available to towns and municipalities with a clear time horizon
The F.D.P. demands:
- Housing and building law must be deregulated
The simplification or abolition of regulations in building law and the reduction of building standards must make construction more cost-effective
- Housing subsidies must be geared more towards individual cases
This requires a move away from property subsidies and an efficient housing allowance for the rental housing sector
Housing benefit is efficient, targeted support for those who need state assistance
Housing benefit rates must be adjusted in line with rent trends without delay
- The overcomplicated, completely unbalanced tenancy law must be modernized in the interests of landlords and tenants
More market instead of state paternalism and investment incentives instead of investment restrictions also work in favor of tenants and landlords here
IX. Liberal Foreign Policy for Germany
The framework conditions for German foreign policy have changed fundamentally on the threshold to the 21st century
Germany is reunited and surrounded only by friends
Democracy
, Rule of law
and market economy are on the rise throughout Europe
For the first time, there is a historic opportunity to create a lasting community of peace throughout Europe
Wars must no longer be possible in Europe
The F.D.P. stands for stability, continuity and reliability in German foreign policy
European embedding,
Alliance capability and
International responsibility for peace must remain the cornerstone of Germany's liberal foreign policy in the future
Liberals face up to the challenges and opportunities of political and economic globalization
Our ability to act in foreign policy depends largely on our international competitiveness
Liberal foreign policy realizes German interests through close cooperation with our partners in Europe, America and internationally
Liberal foreign policy aims to strengthen human rights,
Democracy
and the rule of law worldwide
- against torture, violence, expulsion and oppression
Civil liberties and human dignity are indivisible
We liberals want the strength of the law and not the law of the strongest
Human rights and international law cannot protect themselves
They must be protected by the community of free constitutional states
Those who refuse peace
and freedom - even by military means if necessary - leaves people in the lurch
The F.D.P. demands:
The creation of a Permanent International Criminal Court to act in cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggressive war; War crimes such as those in Rwanda and Bosnia must not go unpunished
The United Nations (UN) must be further developed into the central peacekeeper of mankind in the 21st century
Germany is prepared to take up a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, in order to better meet its increased international responsibility
A joint seat for the European Union (EU) on the UN Security Council remains desirable
The United Nations organization must be streamlined
All member states must pay their dues on time and settle their dues debts
Liberal foreign policy aims to secure international peace worldwide through effective conflict prevention
Peace, Security and human rights will be threatened in the future above all by hunger, poverty, underdevelopment, waves of migration and refugees, water shortages, environmental destruction and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
They are the breeding ground for nationalism, violence, conflicts, abuse of power and political fundamentalism
Germany will actively assume its increased international responsibility in the future within the framework of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO), the European Union and the Western European Union (WEU)
The F.D.P. demands:
Effective conflict prevention and strengthening of collective security through reform and expansion of the United Nations and its regional associations such as the OSCE,
combating terrorism and international crime,
and worldwide containment of the spread of weapons (weapons proliferation)
Liberal foreign policy wants to secure free world trade and strengthen the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Globalization is an opportunity for more competition, open markets, for strengthening peace and prosperity through the international division of labor and through the free exchange of ideas, services, goods and capital
For liberals, globalization does not mean a world economy in a lawless space, but the opportunity for more competition in open markets
The F.D.P. demands:
A multilateral binding legal framework to be further expanded and an enforceable World Trade Organization
German foreign trade interests must be actively promoted within this framework
The opportunities of globalization must be used to accelerate the inclusion of developing countries.
and trade barriers are further reduced in their favor
Liberal foreign policy aims to preserve a habitable and liveable world for future generations
The dramatic loss of fertile soil and water and the population explosion are leading to a lack of food in many regions and often to war and refugee flows
The excessive use of natural resources can be prevented by international law and development cooperation and thus contribute to conflict prevention
We need to better protect our atmosphere by consistently reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases
Effective global environmental protection needs an international environmental legal system
The F.D.P. demands:
All industrialized countries must lead the way in climate protection and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 at the latest in line with their commitment at the Kyoto climate conference
Germany and the European Union must stick to their more far-reaching reduction targets
The International Court of Justice in The Hague must in principle be responsible for the judicial settlement of international disputes over environmental problems
Liberal foreign policy wants a dialog between cultures
Peace between cultures is part of lasting peace
In a world that is moving ever closer together due to the development of new technologies, mutual understanding and tolerance must take the place of prejudices and hostile images based on ignorance
We need a stronger dialog between the different cultural groups
Dialogue between cultures is an active peace policy for liberals
The F.D.P. demands:
Cultural dialogue must be an integral part of German foreign policy
International forms of dialogue, such as the ''House of World Cultures'' in Berlin, must be established and promoted
The Euro-Arab dialogue and comparable institutions should be revived
Liberal foreign policy wants to strengthen culture in our international relations Germany's
presentation abroad must go beyond the presentation of its economic achievements
Despite scarce public resources, Germany must respond to the great international interest in its culture and language
The F.D.P. demands:
At a time when public funds are scarce and in the interest of actively securing the location, foreign cultural policy requires a growing willingness on the part of business to sponsor and a modern foundation law that also facilitates private efforts abroad from a tax perspective
Further cuts in this area must be rejected
The use of budget funds from all federal ministries that have funds for foreign cultural policy requires overarching coordination in order to counteract the existing fragmentation of competencies
A gradual consolidation of competencies and funds in the Federal Foreign Office should be sought
Cultural work abroad with the countries of Central, South-Eastern and Eastern Europe and the CIS states must be strengthened and our European cultural heritage preserved
Pan-European peace order
Since the historic upheaval in Europe, the chances for a lasting European peace order have improved
Nevertheless, the danger of regional conflicts breaking out has not been eliminated
They can affect our security directly and indirectly In the
future, humanitarian missions and peacekeeping will come to the fore
The F.D.P. is committed to the development of a pan-European peace order
Our goal is a united Europe that shares responsibility for peace and freedom
Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE)
The OSCE is the comprehensive framework for security and cooperation in the new Europe
It must be further developed as an effective instrument for preventing and managing conflicts as well as for protecting human rights and strengthening democratic civil societies in Europe based on the rule of law
The F.D.P. demands:
The OSCE's capacity for conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation through democracy and reconstruction assistance to rule-of-law institutions of civil societies must be strengthened
The OSCE's capacity to act must be enhanced through the introduction of majority voting and the creation of a Security Council, the expansion of field missions, and the increased use of OSCE Special Representatives
Western European Union (WEU)
The WEU has gained further importance
It strengthens the EU's ability to act
In a crisis, the WEU can draw on the military formations of its member states and the Eurocorps and promotes the rapprochement of Central and Eastern European states to European and transatlantic security structures
The F.D.P. demands:
WEU should become an integral part of the European Union as soon as possible
Cooperation between the WEU and NATO must be intensified, in particular the WEU's access to NATO resources
Duplication of the same structures must be avoided WEU must be
enabled to carry out humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and peacemaking operations
North Atlantic Alliance (NATO)
NATO is an expression of the community of values and responsibilities between Europe and North America, and as a system of collective defense it is the security anchor for Europe
Today, it is the engine for a broad-based European security architecture
Following the opening of NATO to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the door is now open to admitting further members
At the same time, NATO will cooperate closely with non-NATO countries in the future in the newly created Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
The F.D.P. demands:
NATO must continue to contribute to the emergence of a European security and defense dimension and maintain transatlantic relations
At the same time, NATO must build a lasting strategic partnership with Russia and Ukraine
Disarmament and arms control
Arms control, disarmament and confidence-building are fundamental components of the new European peace order
The opening up of NATO must under no circumstances lead to a new arms race in Europe
Instead, the controlled reduction of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons must be pursued worldwide
The F.D.P. demands:
- Nuclear disarmament must continue
and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons
No more nuclear weapons tests must take place worldwide
Europe needs an effective, stability-oriented arms control regime
Biological and chemical weapons must be effectively banned worldwide
- Arms exports must be reduced worldwide
and arms export controls must be consistently expanded at regional and international level
- Anti-personnel mines must be banned worldwide
The ban on the production, stockpiling, export and use of these mines must quickly become globally valid,
Humanitarian demining measures must continue to be supported
The future of European unification
The European Union can only successfully assert itself in the changed global environment if it advances its integration with the goal of political union and opens itself up to new members
The European unification process itself is the best guarantee of security and stability in Europe
The European Union means more future opportunities for future generations through freedom of movement, mobility, diverse educational opportunities and professional possibilities
We Liberals are committed to a federal European Union, whose basic principles are freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, separation of powers and subsidiarity
Therefore, the EU Treaty must be further developed into a European Constitution that expresses these basic principles
The European Union respects fundamental rights as guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950
Unity in diversity is the liberal European vision
The European Union faces great tasks: It must implement economic and monetary union to complete the single market and lay the foundation for the EU's, and thus Germany's, economic self-assertion in the world; the EU faces the largest enlargement in its history and must seize this opportunity to overcome the division of our continent; it must implement the necessary institutional reforms, press ahead with the reform of the common agricultural and structural policies, and agree on a viable financial framework with fair burden sharing
Strengthening democracy and the EU's ability to act
With the Treaty of Amsterdam, important steps have been taken towards more decision-making and action capacity of the EU and progress has been made on the way to political union
However, to further strengthen action capacity and democracy in an enlarged Union, the EU needs additional decisive reforms
The F.D.P. demands:
- In future, decisions in the Council must in principle be taken by majority vote and represent the majority of the EU population
An effective common foreign and security policy (CFSP) requires qualified majority votes for fundamental and implementing decisions
Only in clearly defined exceptional areas (treaty amendment, enlargement and financing of the EU) does the principle of unanimity apply
- In a democratic Union, the European Parliament must be elected according to a uniform EU proportional representation system and decide on the entire EU budget, including the agricultural budget
The number of Commissioners should be limited to 20 with a view to enlargement
A political union needs a European constitution with a catalog of fundamental rights
Economic and monetary union
The F.D.P.'s policy contributed significantly to the punctual and treaty-compliant start of economic and monetary union
The task now is to realize their goals and implement them in practical policy
The euro strengthens the European economy in global competition with other economic regions
The monetary union creates growth forces for new investments and jobs and has already led to a culture of stability among the EU member states that Europe has never experienced before
The F.D.P. demands:
Germany bears special responsibility for the stability of the euro
Our economic and financial policy must remain strictly stability-oriented
There must be no weakening of the stability pact and no political interference in the monetary stability policy of the independent European Central Bank
The administration in Germany must be a pioneer in the use of the euro and offer citizens and companies invoicing in euros as early as possible
Strengthening internal security and civil rights
The EU must better ensure the security of its citizens and the protection of their rights
Internal freedom of movement and better security of the EU's external borders require increased cooperation in domestic and legal policy
The F.D.P. demands:
- The communitarization of visa policy and asylum law decided on in Amsterdam, as well as deeper cooperation in customs, immigration, controls of the EU's external borders and cooperation in civil and criminal matters must be implemented consistently, with the involvement of the European Parliament
Every citizen of the Union must have legal protection against EU measures, including before the European courts
- The EU needs a common asylum and immigration policy
- Europol must be developed as quickly as possible into an effective European police authority with operational powers in the fight against international organized crime and the fight against drugs and terrorism, strictly bound by the applicable laws in the fight against cross-border crime
For the legal protection of citizens, Europol must be placed under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice
Union enlargement
A central component of the European unification process is the rapid rapprochement and successful integration of the Central and Eastern European states into the Euro-Atlantic institutions
The success of the reform processes in Central and Eastern Europe is directly linked to the accession prospects of our eastern neighbors to the European Union
Germany, as an immediate neighbor, gains advantages from the opening of new growth markets
The F.D.P. demands:
Equal access criteria for the candidate countries ensure that all have the same opportunity to join at the earliest possible stage The
prerequisite for accession is the ability to adopt the entire acquis communautaire
The guiding principle for EU enlargement is: differentiation without discrimination
There must be neither unnecessary delays nor exclusion of applicant and candidate countries Candidate countries that are
initially unable to join must be prepared for full membership in the European Union in a targeted manner through individual pre-accession strategies
Fair financial burdens in an enlarged Union
The European Union's financial system must be reformed
With enlargement to include the Central and Eastern European states, the number of net recipients in the Union is increasing significantly
Germany, as the most populous and economically strongest country, will remain the EU's main net contributor in the future, but will also derive the greatest economic benefit from the EU
We expressly recognize the principle of solidarity within the EU We do
, however, need a more balanced distribution of burdens among the EU member states
The F.D.P. demands:
- The EU must maintain strict budgetary discipline
The EU financial framework of 1.27% of Community gross national product must be maintained even after enlargement
All exemptions must be abolished
- EU spending on research,
Education,
Development
and future technologies must be increased from the current 3.8 % to around 10 % by reducing agricultural expenditure
- An upper limit for the EU contributions to be paid by each state must be introduced so as not to overburden the capacity of net contributors
- The misuse of EU budget funds for agricultural subsidies, structural support, customs duties and levies must be consistently combated
Reform of structural policy
The enlargement of the EU makes a reform of European structural policy inevitable, in order to prevent both a rapid increase in the cost of structural aid and strong economic distortions in the accession countries
All benefits of structural aid must be reviewed and concentrated on the regions lagging furthest behind in development
The F.D.P. demands:
Adaptation aid, especially within the framework of the regional fund, must specifically promote entrepreneurial initiative
and on the development of competitive small and medium-sized enterprises
and the expansion of transport infrastructure
and education systems
Structural and adjustment aid, particularly within the framework of the Cohesion and Regional Funds, should in future be provided on a loan basis wherever possible and linked to performance-related repayment conditions
Competitive agriculture in an enlarged community
The European Union still spends about half of its budget on agriculture
The accession of the Central and Eastern European reform countries and the liberalization of world trade within the framework of the WTO require a fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with the aim of significantly reducing agricultural subsidies overall
The EU Commission's Agenda 2000 reform proposals must be improved, but they point in the right direction
Germany has an overriding interest in a speedy eastward enlargement
However, the enlargement of the Union cannot be financed without reform of agricultural and structural policy
The F.D.P. demands:
- The EU needs market-oriented, competitive and environmentally compatible agricultural production
Production subsidies must be gradually reduced and abolished in the medium term
Support for agriculture must be switched from product-related support to subject- and area-related support In the
future, agriculture must earn the bulk of its income on the market
Alternative services provided by farmers, e.g. for the preservation of cultural landscapes, environmental protection and landscape conservation, should be increasingly rewarded within the framework of regional funds. The
focal points of a future policy for rural areas are the promotion of agricultural enterprises (including income combinations of agriculture and forestry), the creation of alternative sources of income outside agriculture (e.g. in the fields of tourism, handicrafts, landscape conservation) and the establishment of commercial jobs.
EU employment policy
National governments and social partners must not shift their responsibility for reducing unemployment on to the European Union
European employment programs, planned economic setting of Europe-wide employment targets and blanket EU-wide reductions in working hours do not create new jobs
The EU must focus on its contribution to improving the framework conditions for more employment in Europe
The F.D.P. demands:
The EU guidelines for an employment-friendly tax and contribution policy of the member states by reducing high tax and contribution burdens must be implemented consistently
We need an increased exchange on ''best practices'' for job creation between the member states and the promotion of a new culture of self-employment in Europe e.g. through employment-oriented EU funds from the EU Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank
Bundeswehr Planning
Those who refuse peace
and freedom - even by military means if necessary - leaves people in the lurch
The Bundeswehr has met the new requirements of international peacekeeping in an exemplary manner without neglecting its mission of national and alliance defense
At the same time, the Bundeswehr has made a significant contribution to budget consolidation
For Germany's increased international responsibility, our soldiers will continue to need good training, modern equipment and personal planning security in the future
In addition to the new tasks in the context of European and international peacekeeping, the main task of the Bundeswehr remains the protection of external peace, freedom and our democracy
National and alliance defense is and remains the responsibility of all citizens
Compulsory military service makes a decisive contribution to this
Nevertheless, compulsory military service represents a considerable encroachment on individual freedom of choice
The F.D.P. pushed through the reduction of the period of military service to ten months and the introduction of differentiated compulsory military service
With the strengthening of security and stability in Europe through the expansion of the pan-European peace order, compulsory military service can be further differentiated and, if necessary, the minimum period of military service can be shortened
The size of the Bundeswehr is not a dogma for liberals
The F.D.P. demands:
- A reform of the armed forces structure for an efficient and attractive Bundeswehr with the aim of dividing the Bundeswehr into operational and training forces,
further differentiation of a compulsory military service and reduction of its minimum duration to the absolutely necessary level
- Change in the size of the Bundeswehr's personnel to the level required by security policy and the resulting adoption of a personnel cost containment law;
a reform of personnel management with more transparency and traceability of personnel decisions and the introduction of job posting and application procedures for soldiers serving longer;
funding for temporary and professional soldiers must be increased and entry-level salaries must be paid more; an
increase in the number of managers in units for better training and support of soldiers
- opening up all branches of the Bundeswehr to women who want to serve in the armed forces voluntarily and on an equal footing, including at the point of arms and in the context of international peacekeeping missions of the Bundeswehr
- a labor market-oriented, flexible approach to military service members, e.g.e.g., through exemptions for start-ups;
reform of military service exemptions, e.g., the so-called third-son rule and the exemption of theology students are no longer in line with the times
- Increasing investment spending in the defense budget to at least 30 percent
and increasing the efficiency of the Bundeswehr through rationalization and privatization
Liberal Development Partnership
Liberal development partnership sees itself as part of a policy of joint safeguarding of the future
Correctly understood development policy is a fundamental prerequisite for strengthening internal and external peace
It serves to safeguard the natural foundations of life and
economic development
Liberals are committed to a value-oriented development policy The
diversity of cultures does not conflict with this
Democracy, Therule of law and the principles of a market economy are the best foundations for humane development
More and more funds have to be used for emergency and refugee aid and are therefore no longer available for longer-term, structurally effective development projects
Development policy must therefore contribute to crisis prevention
Effective development cooperation aims to improve political, social and economic conditions, in order to promote personal responsibility and initiative in the partner countries
In some developing countries, private capital transfers and free trade are already far more important than official development assistance
Liberals are committed to free world trade and the opening of markets, especially the European market, in the interest of developing countries
Development policy as global social aid is doomed to failure
The scarce resources for development cooperation must be used even more effectively and there must be greater differentiation between partner countries
In development cooperation, other actors besides the state will take on an ever greater role
Liberals welcome the commitment of our citizens, local authorities, business and non-governmental organizations
Developing countries in crisis also threaten German interests
Successful partner countries also benefit our economy and secure jobs
The F.D.P. demands:
- Democracy,
Rule of law,
Respect for human rights,
Combating corruption
and market economy
and development-oriented state action must be used more consistently for the type and scope of development cooperation
In future, the allocation of development aid funds must be more closely linked to respect for human rights.
and compliance with international obligations under international law
Developing countries are first and foremost responsible themselves in the fight against poverty, violent conflicts and environmental destruction
- Development policy must focus on structural change in the key areas of economic and social, environmental and political progress
It is moving away from individual project funding towards system-oriented policy advice and program development on the basis of differentiated regional and country concepts
- Country concepts must focus on regional and local initiatives and structures
These include local markets, savings and credit systems for small entrepreneurs and their local and regional associations and chambers of commerce
- In order to develop efficient capital and credit markets, more private capital must be mobilized, e.g. private-sector financing of infrastructure projects through interest subsidies and default guarantees;
In order to avoid waste, loans for financial cooperation should generally be brought in line with market conditions
- Governmental and non-governmental development cooperation need more transparency and a focus on results
Improved cooperation and coordination, performance reviews, the introduction of market economy principles and the allocation of funding in competition between implementing organizations are all necessary to improve the effectiveness of German development policy
- International development cooperation, especially within the framework of the United Nations, the OECD and the European Development Fund, must be streamlined and better coordinated, and overlapping competencies and programs must be prevented
