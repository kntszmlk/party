A.FOREWORD
//We face our lives with reflection;
//We face a homeland half-conquered,
//with its people living separated from the wall that foreign invaders have erected for so many years.
// For years we have been living in the illusion of the economic miracle, which is in fact an inhuman and predatory "development" model,
// supported directly or indirectly by the established political powers,
// with the basic element of interconnectedness
// and dependence on the banking system (and not only) with specific aims and objectives, in line with the standards of the global new world order.
//We want the creation of such a society that can build and claim its visions with dignity, i.e: //theestablishment of Human and Civil Rights,
//the dignity of the Citizen,
//the unity of the country,
//the peaceful future that is the framework of our aspirations, for a meaningful and not superficial prosperity that has Man at its centre, with Principles, Values and Ideals and not having as its ideal and value, easy profit.
//The Movement of Ecological Citizens' Co-operation intends to emphasize the issues of transparency, clean-up, punishment of the guilty, fairness, good administration, justice and direct democracy (e.g. referendums, recall, horizontal voting, etc.)
//Our clear presence in politics is proof that it is possible to coexist political action with honesty and selfless service to society and citizens.
Β. POSITIONS OF THE ECOLOGISTS' MOVEMENT FOR CITIZENS' COOPERATION
1.CYPRIOT
//The Cyprus problem is mainly a problem of invasion, occupation and violation of international law and human values.
// It is not a problem created by ethnic or religious differences between communities and groups of the Cypriot population.
//Resolution of the Cyprus problem can only be accepted when it leads to the removal of injustice
// restoration of the natural order and respect for human (natural) values.
// The provisions of the Cyprus settlement plan must be viable and workable, but they must also be lawful and compatible with the above values and norms.
// We wish to see an early solution to the Cyprus problem through meaningful negotiations.
// We do not consider that the continuation of the present situation is in the interest of the Cypriot people.
// The main elements of the Cyprus solution must be: a) the unity of the Cyprus area, the people, the society, the economy and so on.
//The solution must provide for a state with a single international personality, a single and indivisible sovereignty, a single people and a single nationality, a single economy, society and ecosystem,
// fair representation of national communities in the collective governing bodies in a rule of law and justice system based on European principles and the security mechanisms of the European Union, elements necessary to ensure the sustainability of any solution.
// Geographical separation and the existence of borders effectively legitimize and freeze the facts of occupation, colonization and division and therefore make the solution unviable and unsustainable.
//Geographical separation of Cypriots based on origin or religion cannot support a peaceful perspective for Cyprus and the region and therefore will not serve the well-intentioned interests of Greek and Turkish Cypriots but only Turkey's plans.
// b) The withdrawal of the Turkish occupying troops is necessary before the solution.
//c) The abolition of all foreign guarantees, interventionist rights and British Bases is imposed.
// d) The cornerstone of the Cyprus settlement is the establishment of the right of all refugees to return to their homes.
// The right to property is inviolable.
//The so-called right of the present property owners cannot be put on the same footing as the right of the legal owner.
// ε) Settlement is a war crime.
// So as a matter of principle, no Turkish settler can be legalized before the solution of the Cyprus problem or through the provisions of the agreement.
//We demand the non-participation of settlers in the Cyprus settlement process (e.g. referendum) as unfortunately happened in 2004.
//After the settlement of the Cyprus problem, persons who do not have legal Cypriot citizenship will be able to acquire it by applying the laws in force in the European Union.
//And respect for the human and political rights of citizens,
// dignity, social justice,
// independence and the abolition of all foreign intervention must be the main and inviolable elements of the solution of the Cyprus problem.
//Summarizing the above, we submit the following specific recommendations: 1.Defining the basic parameters of a Cyprus solution (red lines)
//and their popular ratification through a referendum.
//Participatory process of civil society involvement in shaping the Cyprus settlement.
//2.Proposing the issue of military occupation and settlers.
// International mobilization for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying troops.
//3.Review of the proposals on the various aspects of the Cyprus problem on the basis of collective decisions and with the help of constitutional experts, with the aim of reversing the dichotomous facts of the talks.
//4.Involvement of civil society in the negotiation process with a view to the democratic amendment of the Constitution,
//in such a way as to ensure the continuation of the Republic of Cyprus and the exclusion of parthenogenesis.
//5.Substantial involvement of the European Union at technical level in the direct talks to check the compatibility of the proposals with the existing European acquis (European solution).
//6.Preventing the adoption of the so-called regulation on direct trade with the proposal for the port of Famagusta,
// resettlement of legal residents in the city
// and ecological reconstruction (Green Famagusta).
//Otherwise, exercise of the right of veto on ALL chapters of Turkey's accession path.
// Consider legal action through the European Court of Justice.
//7.Use of European mechanisms to exert pressure on Turkey.
//8.Upgrading the intervention of Cyprus in the process of Euro-Turkish relations
//and the promotion of elements of the Cyprus settlement (e.g. withdrawal of troops, end of colonisation and sale of Greek Cypriot properties) as preconditions for the continuation of Turkey's accession course.
//9.Promotion of the proposal for direct negotiations between Cyprus and Turkey.
// Invitation to international organizations and personalities to take on the role of mediator between Cyprus and Turkey.
//10.Exploitation of the new geostrategic data (energy, natural gas) for the formation of strong civil-military alliances with countries of the region, in order to reverse the negative balance of power.
//11.Supporting the struggles of Turkish Cypriots for liberation from the political, economic, social and cultural control of Turkey.
//Freedom and peace cannot exist without democracy and social justice, without respect for human rights, culture and the environment.
// Our goal is to build a free multicultural society with dignity and respect for Man and his Rights!
2.FOREIGN POLICY
2.1 General Positioning
//Our foreign policy should be adapted to the new realities of international developments by developing, strengthening and maintaining new and strong alliances based on the convergence of mutual short-, medium- and, above all, long-term interests.
//Therefore, we believe that the following strategic steps become an immediate necessity: 1.The submission of an application for membership of the C.D. to the Partnership for Peace.
//2.Investing in the greatest possible and effective participation in the institutions of the European Commission and Council of Europe fora and other European decision-making bodies, with both the number and the quality of our participation increased, and abandoning the empty chair policy due to budget cuts.
//3.Developing close, sincere and mutually beneficial alliances within and beyond the European borders in all areas, with particular emphasis on the following: Economic Technological Military Military Research and Development Cultural and Tourism
//4.Strengthening our engagement within the International Organizations in which we participate in order to cultivate strategic alliances for future use.
//5.Exploitation of natural gas by creating alliances for the benefit of our country
//and ensuring peace in the region.
//6.We propose the creation of a non-governmental body, which will assume the responsibility of promoting the well-intended interests of the Republic: national, political, social, economic, cultural, academic, scientific, promotion of bilateral relations, etc.
// This body will consist of volunteers who will offer their knowledge and skills to assist the work of the Republic of Cyprus at international level and will build bridges of communication with organised groups of expatriate Cypriots and friendship groups of Cyprus abroad.
// The aim will also be to coordinate with the relevant state bodies for the promotion of the official international policy of the Republic of Cyprus.
// The body will undertake to ensure our participation in European forums and other international decision-making bodies, with an increased number and quality of our participation, both for official and lobbying purposes.
//7.To denounce and demand immediate withdrawal from all international conventions,
//which turns Cyprus into an inhuman European concentration camp for migrants and asylum seekers and a protectorate of foreign powers.
//8.The deletion of the term citizenship from all official documents of the state, for all indigenous indigenous Greek Cypriot citizens of the Republic of Cyprus
// and the reintroduction of the term citizenship and nationality.
//It is not meant to translate the term citizenship in English into nationality such as: identity card, birth certificate, passport.
2.2.Global Ecological Movement
//The development model followed has as its main objective the maximization of profits, without taking into account all the negative impacts on nature and human beings.
// It is this model that for decades has been depleting natural resources, dangerously polluting nature with its waste, creating millions of unemployed and condemning a significant part of humanity to hunger and misery.
//We believe that it is our duty to connect with the Global Ecological Movement as well as to inform, raise awareness and mobilize Cypriots, in the context of an international mobilization with key objectives:
//1.respect for the autonomy and independence of each people and movement
//2.support of the global anti-war movement
//3.to participate in international mobilizations and stop the course leading to the global economic and environmental crisis
//4. to engage and lobby for funds for environmental protection in poor countries
//5. participation in international economic "embargoes" on environmental, social and humanitarian grounds for ecological purposes.
// Public awareness is a key requirement
//6.the struggle against Globalization that does not respect people, societies and nature.
2.3.European Green Party & World Green Party
//We were founding members of the European Green Party (EGP) when the 2004 Rome Congress took place, which evolved into the European Federation of Green Parties, of which we had been members since 1998.
//The European Green Party is made up of the Green Parties of the countries of the European continent, not just the European Union, and is based in Brussels;
//It is the European party of the Green Group in the European Parliament and represents the European continent in the Global Greens.
//YoE is a member of the respective youth organisations of the two organisations, the Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG) and the Global Young Greens (GYG).
//We are a long-standing participant in the information and election campaigns of the European Green Party and are committed by the Manifesto as a co-sponsoring party.
2.4 TTIP International Trade Agreement
//In February 2014, a new effort to create a free trade area between the EU and the US was officially launched.
// Previous attempts to negotiate a TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) agreement failed due to coordinated social reactions of European scope
// TTIP is an attempt to re-establish and extend the institutional sovereignty of markets instead of laws passed by national parliaments.
// In 2013 the European Commission approached the major international companies and asked for their proposals in relation to the intention to open negotiations to this end.
// Since then there have been hundreds of meetings with lobbyists, company representatives but very few with NGO representatives.
// Moreover, there is no access to the drafts of the agreement, as the negotiations are conducted in complete opacity.
//In contrast, the big multinational companies, on both sides of the Atlantic, have direct and "responsible" information.
//There are big questions since the European Union has shown unorthodox opacity on this issue.
//We believe that the lack of transparency that governs this particular body constitutes an abuse of its powers and a violation of fundamental democratic principles of operation, leading to its political delegitimization.
// Even the European Parliament has no access to the documents coming from the US.
//Unfortunately, many bilateral agreements have already been signed between states (InvestorState Dispute Settlements or ISDS) that give companies the right to sue states for implementing policies that are against their interests.
//These lawsuits are filed with the World Trade Organization through mediation, not in an international court.
//Under the free trade agreements signed by the US, this status is lifted.
//A company can take a state to court to claim compensation when the state has taken measures in favour of the interests of its citizens that result in a reduction of the company's profits.
//For example, when the Egyptian government decided to raise the minimum wage, Veolia (the French private water company) sued because it was reducing its profits.
// The three-member "independent court" meets behind closed doors.
// Its judges will be drawn exclusively from the ranks of corporate lawyers; there will be a fixed list of corporate lawyers from which each state will be obliged to choose one to represent it.
//Of vital importance for the US is the fact that in order to export natural gas and oil and need international trade agreements of this form.
// Once signed, it will open the way for related exports to the EU, which changes the balance of the EU's energy dependence on Russia.
// Despite the efforts of negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic to conclude the process with as little publicity as possible, the TTIP issue has begun to take shape and reactions are manifesting themselves at different levels.
// Official voices challenging parts of the treaty are growing, while academic studies directly question the alleged economic benefits and note that in no country where such agreements have been signed has an increase in investment followed.
//The movement that is constantly growing in the EU countries and in the US states is particularly dynamic and, as those active in it testify, is characterized by a diversity to an extent that we have not seen for many years.
//Suffice it to think that beyond what concerns geopolitical planning or the institutional core of the EU, TTIP touches the political agenda as a whole: food, public services, patents that extend unchecked from seeds and medicines to collective knowledge and culture, the surveillance and commercialisation of our personal data, the end of US-style labour rights, where even the creation of a union can be prosecuted, constitute inflammable material.
// We stand with the pan-European movement against TTIP and join our voices with all green parties around the world fighting against transnational free trade agreements.
// We supported the citizens' initiative that has so far gathered 3.3 million signatures from all over the European Union, demanding the withdrawal of the negotiations on this free trade agreement,
// and we believe that the Republic of Cyprus must resist the continuation of these negotiations that will directly affect the interests of our country's small and medium-sized enterprises.
2.5 Global mobilisation against climate change COP21 objectives
//On 13 December 2015, a very important International Agreement on Combating Climate Change was reached.
// Humanity has decided to make every effort to limit the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
// This decision therefore means that countries are willing to take much more drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than they have committed to so far.
// The turning point in the negotiations was the move by the 4 (US, China, EU and Canada) to support the demand of the least developed countries and civil society for the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, which seems to have "unlocked" other parts of the agreement, in fact acting as a catalyst for the agreement as a whole.
// States, realizing that today, and despite the INDC's (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), i.e. the voluntary pledges of 146 states submitted in October 2015 at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the planet would continue to be on a trajectory of a global temperature rise of (at least) 2.7 degrees Celsius, agreed to a periodic process of monitoring and reviewing the targets.
// So in 2018, we will have the first global dialogue to record exactly where we stand globally in our joint efforts to reduce our emissions.
//This will be followed in 2020 by a review of the INDCs based on this inventory, a process that will be repeated every 5 years.
// Perhaps the biggest obstacle in the negotiations was the issue of transparency in the periodic reviews of the performance of states.
// The major developing countries saw such a possibility as a loss of national sovereignty, and as a result they strongly resisted the efforts of the EU and the US in particular, to establish a common, uniform system of monitoring and recording of emissions of each state.
// The language of the final text is certainly weaker, since all the options for consequences of non-compliance were removed, but more importantly, the end goal was achieved
// But the biggest gain of the deal is the commitment of developed countries to pay at least $100 billion a year to less developed countries to take mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change
// China and India have played the card of "differentiating" the responsibilities for climate change and will only voluntarily participate in the financing.
//The agreement includes a global climate change adaptation target that is linked to the objective of keeping global temperatures below 1.5oC.
//The importance of mitigation in reducing the need for climate change adaptation measures is underlined.
// The corresponding article particularly encourages cooperation between states and requires states to engage in a planning process for adaptation to climate change.
// These national plans should be periodically updated and communicated by States as part of their national contributions (INDCs) and the five-year reviews of progress in the implementation of the agreement at the global level.
// The issue of addressing the reversible and irreversible impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable countries of the world (Small Island Developing States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs)) has for the first time been given a separate article in the agreement of the 21st World Climate Conference.
// This recognition is of particular political importance for those countries that are most affected by climate change, having contributed very little to the creation of the problem
// The price was the assurance (in the text of the decision and not in the agreement after all) that this recognition would not be accompanied by lawsuits in international courts from vulnerable countries to the developed countries, which are the ones basically responsible for the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so far.
// Of particular concern is the fact that there is no clear reference in the agreement to the priority of Green Climate Fund funding for these countries.
// The Citizens' Ecological Movement has welcomed the signing of this very important transnational agreement and calls on the Republic of Cyprus to be among the first states to sign this agreement.
// The Paris Agreement will be open for signature in New York from 22 April 2016, Earth Day, to 21 April 2017 and, like the Kyoto Protocol, will enter into force 31 days after ratification by at least 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
// So it is equally important for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward this bill for approval by the House of Representatives as soon as possible.
// As the Citizens' Co-operation Movement we have no illusions. We know that it will take a huge effort and mobilisation from all of us to first implement, and then strengthen the Paris Agreement in every country, in every city, in every neighbourhood, in every home, business or workplace.
// The mobilisations of citizens around the world before the start of the COP gave us all hope.
//But much more is needed from many more people, especially in our country with a government that does not seem to understand the historical context, let alone the opportunity it offers, for the recovery of both our economy and the environment.
//We already have experience from the two failed climate conferences.
//The Kyoto Protocol was signed in December 1997 but only came into force in February 2005 and the negotiations to create a successor situation after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol's margins resulted in the Copenhagen Climate Treaty, which ended so ingloriously in December 2009.
//The Paris conference at least managed to unite all countries
//and in particular it was agreed that their commitments would be reviewed every five years, while progress on National Commitments would be regularly monitored using common scientific tools, despite the disappointing absence of specific targets on fossil fuel use and the non-inclusion of legal commitments for the North.
2.6 Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals
//The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the international development goals adopted at the United Nations Millennium Conference in September 2000.
// All 189 UN member states (now 193) have committed their national contributions to these global goals, with a deadline of 2015.
// Due to the different needs of each country, the targets were not equal, so in 2012, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon proposed something new.
//Establishes the agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a target of 2030 as a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals.
// During this period countries are invited to work on seventeen points, which are as follows:
//1.Eradicate extreme poverty in any form anywhere
//2.Eradicate poverty, ensure food security and promote sustainable agriculture
//3.Improving health and the level of sustainability for all ages
//4.Achieving international equality in education and promoting lifelong learning programmes
//5.Promoting gender equality
// and the empowerment of women
//6.Free access to clean drinking water and sanitation to all and for all
//7.Ensuring access to clean energy
//8.Promoting economic development
//9.Building innovative business structures
//10.Reducing inequality among other countries
//11.Creating sustainable cities, without integration issues
//12.Ensuring sustainable development.
//13.Reduction of Climate Change
//14.Maintaining the sustainability of the oceans and seas
//15. Protecting the natural environment from the various shots around the world
//16.Promoting peaceful coexistence among all citizens of the world
//17.Empowering young people through actionable situations
//We fully endorse these proposals and believe that they should be immediately included in a Strategic Framework to be developed through a process of Democratic Dialogue with the participation of civil society and the relevant government departments and independent organisations of the Republic of Cyprus.
// When developed, a specific implementing body should be designated, such as the institution of the Environment Commissioner, in order to have a coordinated authority to promote implementation.
3.DEFENCE
//The defence of every country is the alpha and omega for its existence and survival.
//It is the cornerstone of building trust and security of its citizens for prosperity, progress, social and economic development
// The Republic of Cyprus has every reason to strengthen and develop its defence armour,
// taking into account the problem of occupation for more than forty years by the Turkish invader.
// Not only do we have forty thousand occupying troops against us, but we also have a Turkey against us which can at any time transfer as many troops as it wants to occupy our entire country.
//As long as there is occupation and danger for the homeland, it is imperative that there is a continuous strengthening of the defensive armouring in order to constitute a shield of protection and security for all Citizens on the one hand,
// and on the other hand to act as a deterrent to any foreigner who encroaches on the sanctuaries and sacred objects of the Cypriot People.
//This will only happen with the fundamental reorganization of the National Guard.
//Therefore, and watching with anguish the gradual degradation and even impoverishment of the Defence of Cyprus with the consequent maintenance of the mentality of the defeated minds, the following is implied without unnecessary discussion:
//1.Establishment and operation of a National Defence Council away from any party or political considerations.
//2.The National Defence Council, to be staffed exclusively by experts who will have the knowledge and experience to develop and design a long-term defence armour programme.
//3.Regardless of the party or parties in power, all will be obliged to follow for defence purposes the programme designed and prepared by the National Defence Council.
//4.Insist on the complete demilitarization of Cyprus from all foreign troops
//5.To create a Defence Fund that will be administratively owned and therefore managed directly by the National Defence Council in cooperation with the Ministry of Defence and the head of the respective Think Tank, under the direct supervision of the President of the Republic.
//The Defence Fund will be included in the general budget of the State but will be an autonomous Defence Support Fund, with its revenues deposited in a separate account and not in the fixed fund of the State.
//6.Immediate initiation of contacts with potential interested allies within the framework of our common Defence interests (Greece, Israel, Russia, Russia, France, Partnership for Peace).
//7.Immediate upgrading of the Common Defence Area Doctrine with the inclusion of the new allies.
//8.Gradual full professionalization of the National Guard through the formation of a professional flexible military force.
//9.If the conditions allow it, there will be a simultaneous gradual reduction of compulsory service, within the framework of a correct and productive reorganization of our Defence Armour in both animate and inanimate material.
//10.To promote the compulsory conscription of women to fill positions in logistics, Civil Defence, Red Cross where and when necessary.
//With the modernization of the E.F.
//and the conscription of women will also make it possible to reduce the military service of men.
//11.To get to the root of the serious issue of flight tourism that has been observed in recent years.
//12.Develop a programme in cooperation with the Ministry of Education to introduce a course at all levels of education on the love of the homeland and the importance of protecting it from those who seek to destroy it.
// To cultivate and consolidate the sense of philanthropy through the educational system towards young people.
//13.Effective implementation of community service in response to the need to safeguard the right of conscientious objectors.
//14.Strengthening the psychological support services for soldiers and promoting institutions of self-organization and expression for soldiers and police officers.
//But the defence case is not exhausted or limited to military armaments.
//In most cases the mistake is made of considering the amount of expenditure on military equipment as an indicator of defence capability.
// Cyprus can make more effective use of its high percentage of educated citizens in the formation of a reliable, smart and technologically advanced defence.
//On the other hand, the increase in defence capacity is directly related to the involvement of all citizens in appropriate programmes, which, together with the acquisition of skills, experience and organisation, contribute to the forging of a spirit of militancy and collectivity.
//The utilisation of the female population through conscription programmes that respect the specificity of the social role of women is expected to contribute to this area.
4.SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEMOCRACY EQUALITY
//In order to sustain life on our planet, sanitation must begin with human society itself.
// We want to hope that we can build a new society of people that is not expressed by aggression and rivalry.
// This can be achieved through the establishment of democratic institutions that guarantee the full implementation of human rights.
// The freedom of the individual to be respected.
// The right of expression of individuals or groups to be fully guaranteed.
//Equality of citizens - regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, social or income level, culture, mental or physical disability - must be expressed through the provision of opportunities and rights to all.
// To make the above a reality, we will fight for: 1.the universal and not the selective application of laws, which creates inequality among law-abiding citizens.
//2.the protection of the privacy of citizens,
// Rejection of electronic enveloping and interference with citizens' personal data.
/ / Ensuring the confidentiality of telephone conversations.
//3. the abolition of violence and abuse of power by the police,
// limiting the activities of private security groups (securities) through the establishment of an adequate legislative framework
//4. the institutionalisation of referendums in a way that promotes direct democracy.
//Replicating the European "citizen initiative" in Cyprus law, so that a number of citizens' signatures oblige the government and the House of Representatives to promote legislation
//5.Eliminate all forms of discrimination against ethnic or religious minorities, people with special needs or characteristics and the sick (e.g. AIDS)
//6.Formation of social institutions and technical infrastructure for people with disabilities.
// Implementation and further modernisation of legislation on facilities for persons with disabilities, their integration into society and the avoidance of institutionalisation and social exclusion.
//7.Radical suppression of the bribery, corruption and complicity that undermine the development of society
//and a successful legislative prohibition on the practice of bribery by individuals, organisations or political parties and the corresponding punishment.
//8.Immediate measures to combat bureaucracy, including the application of new technologies and appropriate lifelong training of civil servants.
//9.Develop and implement a comprehensive reform of the Public Administration.
//Reallocation of the number of civil servants based on the needs of the new conditions.
//Consolidation of the civil rights of civil servants.
//10.Strengthening the services of the Commissioner for the Environment, the Commissioner for Administration, the Commissioner for Human Rights and the Commissioner for the Protection of Personal Data.
//Expansion of the competences and strengthening of the Audit Service and the Internal Auditor.
//11.Creation of the institution of the Consumer Commissioner.
//12.Abolition of the over-privileges of politicians (e.g. police guards).
// Abolition of consecutive terms of office in any public office (setting a maximum number of terms).
/ / Implementation of an institutional framework on financial security and incompatibility.
//13.Promote legislation on the operational framework of opinion polls (credibility, solvency, timing of elections).
//14.Promote regulations that require the media to promote and treat all political parties, groups and citizens equally
//and protect journalists working in accordance with the principles of journalistic ethics.
//Modernisation of Public Broadcasting.
//15.Implement effective legislation for the operation of political parties and the financial support of all political organisations.
// Promote legislation that makes it illegal to accept contributions from foreign financial institutions to Cypriot parties and that obliges parties to declare where their financial resources come from and how they are spent.
//Promoting horizontal voting
// and the establishment of proportional representation.
//16.Establishment of a new electoral law on proportional representation.
// We are convinced that the introduction of the new electoral law will be the beginning of a qualitative upgrade of the representation of the interests of the people in Parliament and the elimination of corruption and corruption in most political parties.
//17.De-partitioning of public life through the legislative application of criteria for participation in the boards of semi-governmental organisations.
//Departitization of the Public Service Commission and the Educational Service Commission.
//18.Legislative guarantee of the right to information and access to information of public services.
//19.Strengthening Civil Society.
//The key tool for achieving these goals is the direct involvement of citizens.
//The establishment of institutions of direct democracy.
//The establishment of public consultation procedures and the operation of "civil society" (and not politicians) is the only safeguard of freedom and democracy.
5.WOMEN EQUALITY
//The participation of Cypriot women in decision-making centres, in political and public life, remains extremely low not only compared to other European countries but also compared to poor third world countries.
// The very small number of women in Parliament, the Council of Ministers and local government is a substantial democratic deficit, as half of the population is underrepresented.
//Too few women in managerial positions in both the private and public sector.
//At the same time, the absence of women limits the quality of political life and deprives it of a more holistic and human-centred approach.
//The pay gap between men and women in Cyprus (22%) is still one of the largest in the European Union (average 17%, with 7 countries below 10%).
//Women constitute the majority of persons below the poverty line in Cyprus as well as globally.
// At the same time, violence in all its forms affects women of all ages and social classes the most.
//The most brutal violation of human rights does not only affect womenvictims, it undermines and traumatizes the whole society.
// The extent of violence in Cypriot society has not yet been recorded in comprehensive surveys, but the Council of Europe's figures are indicative: 20.25% of women have suffered physical violence at least once, while 12.15% face violence in their homes on a daily basis.
//Most tragic is the impact of domestic violence on children, with 1 in 5 children having experienced some form of sexual violence in their lives.
// The exploitation and trafficking of women has not yet been effectively addressed in Cyprus.
// The recognition of refugee status to maternal refugees is an obligation of the state.
//Since the Turkish invasion, the Cypriot state, under various pretexts, does not recognize as refugees the children of female refugees, but only of male refugees.
//A key historical point is the legislation on the population register passed in 2002 on the population register, which recognized as refugees only those of ancestral origin despite the opposition vote of the Environmentalist Movement.
//The root cause of all these phenomena is the deep-rooted notions of inequality and power structures against women.
//A practical obstacle, which limits the equal participation of women in all sectors, is the difficulty of combining family life with professional and wider public life.
// We welcome the action plans adopted by the Cypriot state to combat domestic violence,
// to promote equality in education,
// and to combat trafficking in human beings.
// We expect the implementation of the action plans with the necessary coordination and resources from the government.
// The Movement of Ecological Citizens' Co-operation actively contributes to the implementation of the national plans.
// To promote equality we propose: 1.Measures for equal participation of women in decision making: in the political and social arena there are equal players of women and men, but at this stage, with the accumulated effects of centuries of inequality, temporary compensatory measures are needed to address discrimination.
// We therefore propose the introduction of 50-50 quotas in the boards of public and semi-public organisations, in electoral ballots and in senior management positions.
//Adopting a strategy to promote women in public office.
//Providing technical training for women to participate in politics.
//2.Measures to eliminate inequality in employment:Improve and implement legislation guaranteeing women's rights to equal pay and equal treatment at work.
//Strict application of the legal framework concerning labour law and collective agreements.
//Horizontal introduction of a minimum wage for those professions that have not set a minimum wage through a collective agreement.
//Improve legislation on the prohibition of dismissal of pregnant women, with increased penalties and effective enforcement.
//Systematic information of women on their rights guaranteed by legislation and collective agreements, so that they are able to claim them effectively.
//Training programmes for the integration or reintegration of women into the labour market.
//Immediate opportunities for recruitment and career development.
//Awareness-raising for children to choose non-traditional "female" and "male" professions, through school career guidance.
//3.Reconciling family and professional life:Extending maternity leave from 18 to 20 weeks, with full pay, in line with new European standards (European Parliament legislative resolution of 20 October 2010).
//Improving the functionality of parental leave, for mothers and fathers, with full pay for 2 weeks (currently parental leave is not paid).
//Improving childcare and elderly care structures, at affordable cost for the working mother and strengthening the role of local government.
//Expansion of the institution of all-day school.
/ / Flexible working hours and creation of part-time work opportunities.
//Support for distance working to promote its dissemination.
//Support for large families, by increasing benefits and introducing tax relief.
//More substantial support for single-parent families.
//Development of community gyms, clubs, sports and green spaces for healthy activities for children.
//Creation of a safe network of cycle paths, pavements and pedestrian walkways for the safe movement of children.
//Expansion and improvement of the school bus system.
//4.Preventing and combating all forms of violence against women:Implementation of the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Combating of Violence in the Family, by taking measures in the 5 main axes that have been identified
//Addressing the phenomenon of violence, starting from education: changing behaviour patterns and stereotypical roles, empowering children by developing social skills and resistance to violence and discrimination.
//Develop and implement a media code of conduct against violence and gender stereotypes.
//Support and protection of victims of domestic violence.
//Monitoring the problem of violence through scientific research and the development of a complete statistical database.
//Awareness raising and training of professionals (teachers, doctors, nurses, police, judges, etc.) and the general public.
//Improving the implementation of legislation on domestic violence, including repressive and treatment programmes for perpetrators.
//Effectively addressing the problem of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings.
//The phenomenon was not reduced with the abolition of the special visa for "artists" but rather changed its form and their sexual exploitation was transferred to cafes and beer bars.
// Imposition of criminal liability on the client in cases of prostitution offences.
//5.Protection of children from all forms of violence: Protection of children from physical, sexual or psychological abuse and neglect.
//More effective staffing of Social Welfare Services, so that there is an immediate response to incidents of violence against minors.
//Immediate measures to prevent violence and other mental disorders through the cooperation of the Mental Health Services of the Ministry of Health and the Welfare Office with the Ministry of Education and Culture.
// Protecting children from scenes of violence on TV.
/ / Strengthening the service of educational psychologists.
/ / Strengthening public hospitals with child psychologists and child psychiatrists.
//6.Other policies to promote gender equality:We support the amendment of the legislation governing Family Law, so that spouses who happen to be guarantors of their ex-spouses' loans are not victimized.
// Upon the issuance of the divorce, both the property and the debts of the couple are divided.
//Taking over maintenance obligations from the Welfare Office in cases where it is demonstrably impossible.
// Immediately promote the amendment of the Law on Population Registry to delete all provisions that create gender inequality.
6.YOUTH
//Youth is the hope for the future of the country on which all the visions and aspirations that were not realized by the previous generations are invested and projected.
//Thus, youth bears a great burden, it must realize the aspirations for a better tomorrow and fill in the gaps and shortcomings of the past,
//but at the same time it must find its own way, set its own goals and priorities.
// In today's Cypriot society we live in, it is not difficult to recognize a confusion of identity, external patterns and culture becoming established
//and the new generation, more flexible, moving towards new ways of expression, becoming aware of new techniques and possibilities (e.g.(e.g. use of e-mail),
// but also becoming captive to virtual reality, the individualism of our times and the race to acquire power and material goods.
//To all this is added the burden of a semi-inhabited homeland and the narrow framework within which one can work towards the vision of a free and unified state,
//not to mention the destruction of the natural environment and the ecological nightmare that looms over our heads.
//In this climate, the youth must acquire the tools to claim a better tomorrow for themselves and for the next generations.
//Priority must: Gain a voice and get involved in decision-making centres;
//Fight against the buffoonery that makes the process of finding a job a humiliating and degrading experience for young people;
//Gain new role models and get actively involved in civic and voluntary groups.
//Combat insecurities, self-doubt and self-destructive paths with addictive substances
//Get a comprehensive and all-round education (with a reduction in non-education)
//and receive advice on studies and careers.
//To be educated about the environment in which they live (integration of environmental education in schools)
//and to be informed about the global environmental situation (climate change, hunger, globalisation, human rights abuses, development model)
//The major chapter of unemployment and underemployment that afflicts the young people of Cyprus must be opened in an open and honest social dialogue
//and priority must be given to employment and training issues.
//As the Movement of Ecologists and Citizens' Co-operation, we support the work of the Cyprus Youth Council over the years;
//We adopt its resolutions and working documents as documents that have emerged through processes of consultation with the wider youth movement of the country, with the participation of both political and non-political youth organisations, and we hope that they will continue to broaden the areas they deal with in the future.
//We consider the work of the Cyprus Youth Organization very important but we believe that it should broaden the participation in its board of directors to include a representative from all parliamentary parties;
//At the same time, we believe that its direct involvement in the processes of drafting strategies and bills related to youth issues should be strengthened and promoted, and that it should not be limited to the management of national and European funds for youth organizations' actions.
7.UNEMPLOYMENT
//Unemployment rates in Cyprus have increased in recent years to a very alarming level.
//Based on the monthly report of the Statistical Office, in February 2016 there were 46,000 registered unemployed, of which 23% were young people under 30 years old and 49% were women.
//The effects of the economic crisis have created an unbalanced working environment and exploitation of workers.
//Cyprus' human resources, which are characterized by high levels of education, constitute a wealth for the country and a factor that, if properly utilized, can contribute to the development of the economy and society.
//We believe that work is a right and not a luxury.
//We stress that unemployment is also underemployment
// We adopt the recommendations of the Youth Council of Cyprus' Policy Paper on Unemployment.
//Specifically, we believe that: 1.There should be a clear targeting towards development, through structured cooperation between the public and private sectors and proper utilization of existing resources in development projects.
//2.To invest in research and innovation, amounting to at least 3% of Cyprus' GDP, based on the relevant European Directive.
//3.Promote policies for the development of the green economy (renewable energy sources, recycling, waste management, ecotourism, etc.),
//which will contribute to the protection of the environment
//and job creation.
//4.To upgrade the Vocational Guidance in order to provide pupils, parents and students with information and guidance according to the real needs of the labour market.
//5.Promote further recognition and certification of professional qualifications for the registration of various professions by competent bodies, such as the Human Resources Development Authority.
//6.Adopt the recognition and certification of skills, especially those acquired through non-formal and informal learning.
//7.Promote the expansion and upgrading of policies related to reconciling family and work, in order to reduce the proportion of women forced out of the labour market.
//8.To support the upgrading of the offered programmes and projects of continuing education and training based on the needs of the labour market and the accessibility of those interested in them.
//9.Implement plans to promote and encourage youth and female entrepreneurship by providing incentives, including tax incentives, reducing bureaucracy, and providing parallel training to enable their business plans to succeed.
//10.To link the financial support of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) with the employment of unemployed people.
//11.Utilize unemployed people in public benefit projects, so that they can gain experience and acquire new skills at the same time.
//This way the unemployed can become active.
//12.To better promote and use the European Programmes, both for development purposes,
//as well as support for young unemployed people
//13.To upgrade the institution of the Public Employment Services, while decentralizing the provincial departments.
//Creation of a specialised service for young unemployed people.
//14.Promote the creation of the institution of Employment Counsellors to advise, among other things, on ways in which someone can be reoriented professionally.
//15.Improve access to information on the labour market, including employment opportunities in other EU Member States or in third countries.
//16.Strengthen the protection of workers through information on basic labour legislation and the creation of a complaints authority.
// In this field, both the Guilds and youth NGOs, as well as secondary and higher education institutions can contribute.
//17.Adopt measures to subsidise vocational training for long-term unemployed people to gain work experience and qualifications.
//18.To provide opportunities to gain professional experience during secondary and higher education, through the institutionalisation of internships for the acquisition of professional experience.
//During the traineeship, the protection of young people from exploitation by employers should be ensured
//19.Take measures to combat illegal and undeclared work and introduce stricter penalties for employers.
//20.Modernising the education system to combine the transition from education and training to the labour market.
//21.Create post-secondary schools offering technical and other vocational training diplomas to high school graduates who do not wish to obtain a university education.
//22.Modernise the system of recruitment and evaluation of teachers to ensure the provision of quality education and give young people the opportunity to work in this sector.
//23.Not to extend the retirement age, in order to avoid burdening new entrants to the labour market and delaying the promotion of deserving employees to administrative positions.
//24.Introduce policies to shield and protect the rights of young people in the workplace.
//25.To continue the use of young unemployed people in polling stations during the electoral procedures.
//26.Introduce policies to encourage the employment of people with disabilities and people from economically vulnerable groups of the population.
//27.Ensure the promotion of equality in the workplace and non-discrimination against young women or mothers in favour of unemployed men because of their existing or impending family responsibilities.
//28.Further promotion of programmes related to training and employment in the energy and especially gas sectors.
8.ECONOMY
8.1 Basic Principles
//We believe that the economy should be treated as part of sustainable development;
//Resources should not be wasted at the expense of future generations;
//The economy should be managed without dogmatism and standards but with the overriding aim of raising living standards without encouraging consumerism.
//We do not support the adoption of a liberal model of an open economy, as promoted through the Memoranda of Understanding with the Troika of the European Union, the World Bank and the European Central Bank;
//The government should intervene in the management of the Cypriot economy for the purposes of social solidarity and equal development without turning the state into a businessman;
//The government should require the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments in the preparation of projects.
//Το περιβάλλον αποτελεί εθνικό πλούτο που χρήζει προστασίας και σωστής διαχείρισης προς όφελος όλων.
//Για αποκατάσταση των περιβαλλοντικών ισορροπιών χρειάζεται η επιβολή περιβαλλοντικού τέλους.
//Τα έσοδα αυτά θα πρέπει να ξοδεύονται αποκλειστικά για τη μείωση των αρνητικών επιπτώσεων στις επηρεαζόμενες περιοχές.
//Economic aggregates are not an end in themselves and economic growth is not independent of social growth but must go hand in hand in a balanced way.
// Η οικονομική ανάπτυξη να αποτελεί την κινητήρια δύναμη για στήριξη της
// "The measure of all money is Man" (Protagoras 490-420 B.C.) First of all and above all is Man and not money. These words were spoken by Protagoras two and a half thousand years ago and we fully endorse them.
//Money, must serve the Economy, the needs of Man.
//But the needs of Man must not depend on money.
//That is, the necessities, what must be done in society and in every human society, must be provided by money.
//Money must not influence the planning of the necessities, that is, the needs of Man.
8.2 Rectifying the Economy of the Memorandum with the Troika 2013
//In our present political situation, the dominant element in any socio-political analysis and social proposal is its economic dimension.
//The long-lasting policy of successive governments focused its efforts exclusively on the temporary maintenance of monetary liquidity in the economy, ignoring the fact that a large part of the citizens depended on sectors of the economy that were particularly susceptible to external factors, such as the provision of financial services, the construction industry or tourism.
//This lack of strategic long-term planning and vision is the main reason for the collapse of our economy.
// Despite the haircut and the destruction of our economy in 2013, with all the consequent effects on public and private life and the disruption of our social fabric, it seems that many decision-makers have not changed their minds.
//Neither the current government nor the majority of political parties have understood the urgent need for a complete change of our economic model, in order to avoid future repetition of the same mistakes.
//They did not seize the opportunity created by the crisis to make a 180-degree turn and introduce new economic models and practices.
//Even as far as public finances are concerned, no substantial restructuring has been done to promote the rational management of the state apparatus, the reduction of operating costs and the acceleration of structural changes.
// The economic crisis, which has been intensifying since 2008, is a reality that dominates social and political developments.
// Of course, more important than the fluctuations of the stock markets and the course of the big companies, are the effects on the lives of ordinary people, where numerous jobs have already been lost and even more are threatened by the development of the crisis.
// The answers to the financial crisis are neither easy nor given.
// In Cyprus, the crisis has not yet caused spectacular failures of financial institutions, as in other countries.
//Its development, however, directly affects the so-called "real economy", which has much greater weaknesses than most European countries.
//The government, the Minister of Finance and the ruling party are celebrating that the economy is doing well.
//They are celebrating because they went to the markets, they are celebrating because they borrowed to pay back the loans.
// Instead of celebrating the loans, let's get serious and reflect on reality and not on the cooked numbers that prosper.
//As the Movement of Ecologists and Citizens' Co-operation we propose the following: 1.The evaluation, promotion and demand by legal means of an audit of the total debt of the Cyprus State by a board of experts and lawyers.
//2.To support the audit and denounce the Memorandum and the loan agreements, which are considered illegal, invalid and contrary to the interests of the Citizens.
//3.To promote studies and cross-cutting movements aimed at eliminating the external and general public debt of the country and the legislative establishment of balanced state budgets.
//4.The defence of the rights of borrowers by the Banking Institutions.
//5.The creation of a public institution/state bank that will take over all real non-performing loans, in order to prevent the selling off of the properties of the Cypriot people to international banking institutions and loan sharks.
//This newly established bank will undertake the actual control of a specialised service in order to determine the amount of the non-performing loan that can be serviced according to the actual financial situation of each borrower.
//The amount remaining to remain as frozen debt.
//An annual check of the financial situation of each borrower.
//We further call for the freezing of all truly non-performing loans until the creation of this entity, in conjunction with the recovery of the real economy.
//6.The immediate establishment of a legal framework by the State with regard to loans in Swiss francs in order to restore them to the exchange rate of their issuance.
//7.To prohibit by law the sale of the assets of the Republic of Cyprus such as the semi-governmental organisations.
//8.To substantiate and denounce all bills that are contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus for the disposal and rescue of private companies such as banking institutions such as: a.Theft from the haircut of deposits. b.Theft of savings from securities holders. c.Recapitalization from public finances for the benefit and rescue of the former People's Bank.d.Recapitalization from public finances for the benefit and rescue of the Co-operative Movement.e.Divestment of the people's assets for the alleged rescue of the banks.f.Sale of loan packages to foreign companies of foreign suspected interests and to domestic companies operating as satellites of foreign interests or with predatory intentions aimed at
//9.The claim by the State for the abolition of the privileges of the Banks at the expense of our People.
//10.The claim of the State for the application of Article 26 of the Constitution and other constitutional provisions protecting the People.
//11.The fight against usury and the bleeding of the People from the predatory disposition of their rulers.
//We call for the inclusion of credit institutions in the legislative framework governing usury and the strengthening of the law on unfair clauses that violate consumers' rights, so that citizens can find justice more quickly and out of court.
//It is our conviction that in order to reverse our current economic situation and bring true economic vitality to our country, there must be a fundamental change.
// The Public Debt remains disproportionately large in relation to Cyprus' GDP and we believe that, despite the exit from the Memorandum, we remain at risk unless specific measures are taken to reduce it.
// To this end we propose the following: 1.The change of the development model with a shift to the primary and secondary sector of the economy - agriculture, livestock, fisheries, crafts and industry.
//2.Take measures to mitigate the over-dependence of our economy on the tertiary sector, which is particularly vulnerable to exogenous factors, such as the tourism and construction sectors.
//3.The introduction of new technologies that are environmentally and human friendly.
//4.Supporting research and technology by utilizing young scientific staff and innovative technologies.
//5.The introduction of environmental policies in the context of a sustainable and circular economy that creates thousands of green jobs.
//6.Addressing the real cost to the economy of the mismanagement of our natural resources.
//7.The introduction of measures to protect natural resources, water, forest land, etc.
//Accelerating the transition to the digital economy and the application of new technologies.
//9.Utilisation of the academic potential of public and private universities for the formulation of strategic economic policy and macroeconomic objectives.
8.3 Tax Reform
//1.To review the general tax framework in order to abolish unnecessary indirect taxes;
//2.To reform the Real Estate Tax in order to provide tax exemption as an incentive for agricultural and livestock use, the installation of RES on unused land parcels and for those parcels located within Protection Zones and Natura 2000 areas;
//3.To provide tax incentives to encourage the creation of new jobs
; //4.Undertake a concerted campaign to combat tax evasion and avoidance;
//5.Reform the Income Tax and modernise the way it is collected;
//6.Introduce a Digital System that allows the interconnection of records to check the assets of natural and legal persons, identifying undeclared income;
//7.Identify undeclared assets and bank accounts abroad, within and outside the European Union.
Small and medium-sized enterprises
//1.The incorporation of measures to protect small and medium-sized enterprises from unfair competition;
//2.The introduction of stricter measures to ensure that employers comply with the terms and conditions of employment of their employees;
//3.Special regulation to ensure the labour rights of shop and hotel employees, particularly with regard to the issue of working hours and working on public holidays;
//4.The abolition of the use of vouchers against wages by employers.
Public sector reform:
//1.To abolish the right to collect more than one pension due to appointment or election to state office.
//2.Introduction of a shift system in all jobs involving inspections.
//3.Strengthening supervisory and administrative institutions
//4.Regarding promotions, we believe that once the issue of the ownership of the organisation has been resolved, they can be promoted if and when deemed necessary on the basis of a human resources study and a cost/benefit analysis of such a decision.
//These weaknesses were created over time by: 1.Reliance on "easy money" (such as the stock market, real estate), as well as on an over-inflated private consumption, which in recent years has been based on excessive borrowing.
//2.The disproportionately central role of the construction sector as the "engine of the economy".
//3.The very high level of public debt, which remains unabated as a short term solution to the situation is emerging without real and lasting answers on how to reduce deficits and how to recover the economy.
//4.Over-reliance on sectors directly affected by the international crisis, such as tourism and construction.
//5.The over-reliance on imported energy (oil and gas), energy waste and a polluting energy model
//6.The alarmingly increasing rate of pension expenditure, both for civil servants and social security, which, as indicated by actuarial studies, could be catastrophic in the medium term.
//7.The absence of effective protection of natural resources in areas such as water, forest land, natural areas and biodiversity.
//8.The delay in the transition to the digital economy, and in the application of new technologies.
//The government's policy so far focuses exclusively on the temporary maintenance of monetary liquidity in the economy, ignoring the fact that a large part of citizens depend on almost doomed jobs in construction or tourism, which threatens to drag down a large part of the rest of the economy.
//It does not take advantage of the opportunity created by the crisis for the rational management of the operating costs of the state apparatus
//and the acceleration of structural changes to lead to a fairer society.
// The gap between the private and public/public sector is widening and tends to create two tiers of citizens, those who enjoy high wages, privileges and job security and the rest who are plagued by unemployment and poverty.
8.4 Green Economy and Development
//In addition to measures to reduce the fiscal deficit, the countries hit hardest by the crisis have turned to the New Economy and new growth sectors, focusing on Green Growth.
//At a time when "Green Growth" is becoming a central issue in the economic policy of all national governments and the European Union, the absence of a coherent, cohesive and ambitious framework for "green growth" in government economic policy is a negative impression.
// The central issue is therefore the creation of new quality and decent jobs in sectors that promote sustainability, in order to provide a way out for those who lose their current jobs.
//Development projects should contribute to economic and environmental sustainability, be based on the use of new technologies and activate human potential.
// We have proposed and submitted specific proposals such as: 1.Investing in the digital economy through the full computerization of the state machine and cheap and affordable broadband, which should be the major development project.
// It will bring about economy, efficiency and a more meritocratic operation of the state apparatus
// and will create thousands of employment opportunities for young people.
//2.Investments in renewable energy, which are in any case necessary and urgent for energy security, for tackling climate change and for the transition to the post-oil era.
//3.The shift to sustainable transport and public transport since in recent years, the transport sector has had the most uncontrolled increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
// Without a decisive shift towards public transport, it is impossible to improve the situation.
//4.The creation of a residential environment with a substantial quality of life with small and large public works that can provide new jobs, upgrading the quality of life of citizens and even improving their economic prospects
//5.The rational management and protection of water resources
//6.The change of orientation in tourism, towards new forms such as agrotourism, ecotourism, etc.
//The economy is not limited to indicators and numbers, but focuses on the well-being of every citizen and the responsibility of all of us towards future generations.
//It is therefore worth trying proposals that go beyond the philosophy of the current social and economic system.
8.5 Taxation and Pensions
//The taxation of citizens must be fair
//and protect the low paid.
// Ecological or sustainability criteria must also be taken into account.
// Tax evasion must be severely combated and punished as it undermines the economy of the state.
// Indicatively, we should: 1.Revise the legislation on tax evasion.
//Taxation should be proportional to the presumptions of living.
//2.To abolish the right to collect more than one high pension.
//3.Tax all allowances of officials.
// The amount of benefits should not be included in the calculation of the pension amount.
//As regards the pension system, the sustainability of the Social Security Fund should be immediately ensured so that future generations are not left exposed to pension risks.
// A total change of the pension system is needed.
8.6 Privatisations and shareholdings
//With the current management regime of the Semi-State Organizations and Enterprises, neither the consumer nor the public interest is served.
//All semi-governmental organizations are necessary and necessary to be modernized, decentralized and strengthened.
//1.As a position of principle, we reject any form of privatization.
//Privatization is an alienation of state wealth and is not the solution to the problem of the Semi-State Organizations.
//2.Incase this is not feasible, then we are ready to discuss an alternative proposal that provides for the shareholding of these companies, with the basic condition that the government should be in control by retaining the largest percentage of shares;
//3.A percentage of shares should be held by the employees and the rest should be allocated to the private sector
; //4.Efforts should be made to attract foreign investors to strengthen domestic economic vitality;
//5.It is necessary to draw up plans for mapping a course of radical restructuring and reform of all semi-public institutions and companies.
8.7 Stock exchange
//The stock market institution has been transformed from a dynamic role in promoting the economy to a gambling mode due to the lack of proper management and the necessary institutional framework.
// The strengthening and full independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission is needed.
//Institutional amendments to the Law are required to promote the stock exchange institution, transparency and the confidence of the investing public.
//The following should be done: 1.Legislative regulations should be made that do not allow direct or indirect links between brokers and investment companies.
//2.Encourage institutional investors to invest substantially in the CSE.
//3.Lower interest rates to make stocks more attractive in the long run.
//4.To establish, as a matter of policy, that the stock exchange periodically publish the intrinsic value of each company per share, confirmed by its auditors.
//5.Expedite the promotion of the Investment Services Firms Bill on issues such as the licensing of investment advisors and portfolio managers, their qualifications and the necessary
//6.To substantially strengthen the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission and make it fully independent from the government and any interventions.
//7.Privatise the CSE and make the state no longer responsible for its operation.
//8.Expedite the investigation of the Investigative Committee on the CAC.
//9.Expedite the procedures to the Attorney General's Office to investigate the complaints made by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
8.8 Tourism
//The importance of tourism for our country is of paramount importance for economic, national and social reasons.
// Based on the above, and much more, there is an urgent need for the preparation of a long-term national plan for the development of the tourism product, which should cover both foreign and domestic tourism.
//For decades we have warned that uncontrolled tourism development with emphasis on increasing quantities and numbers, without evaluation of the real benefits, would result in the deterioration and degradation of the tourism product and the Cypriot environment and would kill the "chicken that lays the golden eggs".
//Unfortunately we have been confirmed.
//As much as the need for environmental protection and the need for balanced development of all sectors of the economy based on the available natural resources and human potential of the country was emphasized, these needs were ignored.
// The tourism sector was constantly growing and became the mainstay of the economy.
//At the same time, however, unbridled tourism development has eroded and destroyed the unique natural environment that was mainly what made Cyprus an attractive tourist destination.
//Today, even if belatedly, there are voices from others to take urgent measures to save the tourism industry
//and to address further environmental degradation.
//We recommend: 1.A planned restructuring of the tourism sector and the preparation of a ten-year strategic plan, which will promote different types of tourism with reference to the benefits derived from it, but also taking into account the environmental costs.
//Promoting other types of alternative tourism, such as: Rural tourism Winter tourism Sports tourism Therapeutic tourism Cultural tourism (theme parks, international festivals, museums, interactive activity centres) Cultural tourism and special interest tourism.
//2.Staffing the Board of Directors of the CTO and the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism with scientists trained in ecology and alternative forms of tourism activity.
//3.Definition of strict tourism zones with criteria relating to environmental and social characteristics of the areas.
//4.Environmental upgrading of the operation of existing tourist units in terms of energy saving, biological treatment facilities, waste disposal, noise pollution, installation of Renewable Energy Sources units and general micro-environmental management.
//5.Cessation of gratuitous subsidies to hoteliers.
//6.Review of the way the CTO allocates and manages the funds it spends on advertising abroad, aimed at mass tourism, and focus on features that promote the specificities of Cyprus and escape the vicious circle of competition with other similar markets.
//7.Creation of an Environmental Upgrading Fund to mitigate the ecological damage caused by tourism activity.
//Revenues will come from the proportional burden on businesses in the tourism sector, through the imposition of a green tax.
// Charging the ecological costs of tourism activity (depletion of natural resources, environmental destruction, desalination and air pollutants from golf courses, etc.) to entrepreneurs in the sector.
//The proceeds from this fee can be used to improve the environment, which will again benefit those who pay it.
//8.Compulsory escort of tourist buses by licensed tour guides, especially for buses carrying tourists in the occupied territories.
//9.Creating infrastructure in the hotel industry for people with disabilities, handicapped people, disabled people, etc.
//10.A clear policy change of the CTO that focuses on the protection of the remaining natural environment of Cyprus.
//11.Allocation of funds from the CTO for the protection and conservation of nature, mainly in areas that attract Special Interest Tourists and Rural Tourism.
9.INTERNAL GOVERNANCE
//It is now known to all that the institutions of the State have been damaged to the most serious degree, leading the people to a complete lack of trust in them on the one hand and to the disparagement of politicians and other state officials on the other.
This finding alone is a mortal wound to the foundations of democracy
//and therefore a policy of radical institutional reforms is required immediately so that the 1960 Constitution can be adapted to the requirements and needs of the 21st century and the directives of the EU.
9.1 Unified DevelopmentsUrban Planning
//The construction of large projects is often the cause of ecological disasters in our country.
//Most large or small projects (motorways, ports, ports, building complexes, etc.) have been designed and executed without any care for the environmental impact.
// Many projects suffer from grand idealism, i.e. they have been done with criteria of sensationalism and populism rather than functionality and economy.
//There is great waste and frequent irregularities and scandals, while the operating costs of major projects are not taken into account in the initial planning (energy, maintenance, etc.). Examples of uneconomic projects with irreversible and serious environmental impacts are the proposed Paphos - Polis Chrysochou road, the Limassol Marina, Eleftherias Square, etc.
//We recommend the following measures for rational urban development: 1.Dense, mixed development of cities and settlements.
//2.When changes are made to urban zones, plans for the extension of the public transport network and the cycle/pedestrian network should be made at the same time.
//3.To create settlements, streets or neighborhoods where there will be no cars.
//4.Rational location of government services.
//5.Preparation of environmental impact assessment studies before the final design of traffic infrastructure projects.
//6.Repeal outdated government plans to build highways in forest and residential areas: Cancellation of the planned extension of the Academy Avenue through the Athalassa and Pedagogical Academy national forest parks
//7.Create zones where only low-emission vehicles will be allowed to circulate, especially in city centres.
//8.Imposition of higher road taxes for cars - including trucks - that emit high levels of pollutants into the atmosphere or even a complete ban on the circulation of such vehicles.
//9.Incentives should be given for the withdrawal of all old vehicles.
//10.Create pedestrian streets in shopping centres and traditional squares in towns and villages.
//11.Disseminate teleworking and teleconferencing in the culture of business and the public sector.
//12.Changing the way we drive to safer and greener, more environmentally friendly
//with respect for pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers.
//This will be achieved by introducing traffic education in school curricula and by organising public information and education campaigns on these issues.
//13.Introduction of staggered working hours for different sectors of workers and for schools.
//14.Measures to promote the use of electric, hybrid and low-consumption cars.
9.2 Quarrying activities
//The over-expansion of quarrying activities has led to a number of serious environmental disasters.
//Many quarries operate near or within areas of outstanding beauty or natural importance (forests, gorges, canyons, rock formations, bat habitats), near residential areas or archaeological sites.
// Still, in several cases, the damage remains after the end of quarrying operations.
// Unfortunately, it seems that due to the "essential" function of quarries in the whole construction system, very little has been done to control quarrying activities in an effective way.
//We recommend: 1.Inventory of quarrying zones throughout Cyprus by preparing a comprehensive Island Plan and the creation of a long-term strategic quarrying plan.
//2.A full and comprehensive environmental study of any project, as a necessary condition during its design and before its implementation.
// Checking the implementation of the terms of the environmental study.
/ / Implementation of environmental liability legislation.
//3.Objective costing of quarry materials based on the impact of the specific activity on the environment (natural, cultural, residential).
//4.Transparency and public presentation of the initial proposals for any project
//5. Change the legislative framework controlling quarrying activity.
//6.Strengthening of the Mines Service, so that it operates efficiently.
//7.Recycling of aggregates to reduce the amount of quarrying.
//8. Full implementation of the law that provides for the restoration of the natural environment where quarrying activities are terminated and return to the original owners of the land.
9.3 Sustainable Development
//The complex concerns of global society in relation to the environment and natural resources, biodiversity, health and quality of life have led to the concept of sustainability, or more simply sustainability.
// It was preceded by the experience of the intensification of production and competition, especially after the industrial revolution and the overexploitation of natural resources which, in the colonial era, led to the plundering of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Third World and the wars for oil, water, etc.
//This model of development is still applied in many less developed countries.
// The development model followed in Cyprus after independence could not have been wiser than the international trend in the preceding years.
//If such an excuse is acceptable for the first years after 1960 and for the years after the Turkish invasion, it is unacceptable that the development plans of successive Governments continued to move in the same, outdated framework which may feed the conventional economic indicators with positive figures, but as a rule stress and alter the environment.
//The great importance of the tourism sector is dictated by economic data, but the orientation of economic policy towards mass tourism with the exclusive aim of high numbers of visitors and beds without a real analysis of the benefits for Cyprus has led to the squandering of environmental resources, undermining the prospects even for tourism itself.
// The degradation of agriculture, with the change of land use, urbanization and the reduction of industry to small-scale manufacturing activity, bodes pessimistic for the future.
//Directions for agriculture and industry need to be redefined in today's competitive and environmentally sensitive international climate.
//There is an immediate and urgent need to understand and adopt the model of sustainable management based on the ecological use of resources to serve the real needs of society
// and the ability to serve future generations.
9.4 Local government
1. Size
//We agree with the findings of the study regarding the excessive fragmentation of local government authorities and the need to create new local government structures;
//We believe that the promotion of a new institutional framework for the consolidation of existing structures through the clustering of local government authorities is in the right direction.
//We do not agree that city municipalities should definitely be consolidated into a single municipality
//but we are convinced that the establishment of an independent committee to examine each case and come up with proposals after consultation with the authorities involved will be able to reach reasonable conclusions.
//We want to make it clear that this independent committee should be composed of both representatives of the executive and representatives of local authorities
//We consider it essential that all political parties be represented on this committee, through their elected representatives.
//We believe that not only population parameters should be taken into account in determining the geographical regions of the new municipalities, but also geographical and historical ones;
//But the researchers should give an estimate of what they believe to be the smallest (population) size that they believe can be viable for the case of Cyprus and the independent committee should take this estimate into account when coming up with the new municipalities.
2.  Separation of primary and secondary local government
//We consider it appropriate to maintain most municipal and community councils as an institution for ensuring subsidiarity, but without the supportive structure they currently enjoy and without the powers and responsibilities they currently have.
//We believe that in this way every citizen is guaranteed access to a representative body to raise issues that fall within the sphere of local government, which will undertake to mediate to the responsible municipal council to promote them
//We believe that this consensual proposal will also be able to resolve the threats identified by the experts in their report for this option (delay in decision-making and reduced capacity in the units to be set up in the countryside) and we hope that it will be taken seriously.
3.   Responsibilities
//The Movement of Citizens' Ecological Cooperation agrees in general with the recommendations of the experts regarding the transfer of responsibilities to the level of local government;
however, we express our disappointment that they did not propose the transformation of one of the most anachronistic institutions of the Republic of Cyprus, that of the provincial administrations.
//We have always envisioned the establishment of a secondary organ of power, which would be an evolution of the current provincial administrations,
//with democratically elected municipal councils
//and a corresponding administrative structure, but expanded to include the administration of all the powers that scholars have identified as being best served at the local level.
// We believe this is a weakness of the proposed plan and would like to see more bold scholarship on this point.
// In terms of the devolution of powers proposed in the plan, we agree with most of the recommendations so we will only comment on issues where we have alternative or supporting suggestions to offer.
// The suggestions below are illustrative and not exhaustive.
// We reserve the right to submit full proposals subsequently
A) Environmental Impact Studies
//We agree with the experts that the responsibility for the examination of MIPs for small projects can be transferred to the local government level.
B) Strengthening the role of traffic wardens
//We agree with this proposal but we believe that it will only have a chance of success if the demotic traffic police officers are converted into interchangeable personnel, who will move regularly between municipalities.
C) Urban Planning
//Without a centrally prepared Island Plan, defining with pan-Cypriot strategic objectives the areas that will be available for building development,
//that must be preserved to ensure agricultural and livestock production
//and that are suitable for industrial development, there can be no hope for a substantial improvement of the economic model of Cyprus.
//And without an Island Plan, the transfer of urban planning responsibilities to the local level will be problematic if not dangerous.
D) Public Transport
//We are very positive about further involvement of local government in public transport issues.
//But we want to emphasize that the geographical limitations of our island require that public transport is under the control of a central body.
// An example of the problems that arise when there is no clear division of responsibilities between the various stakeholders is the failure to install the "smart" bus stops, which would have played a key role in the success of the Public Transport Strategy.
//As a result of the piecemeal implementation of this strategy, today we have bus stops that have no infrastructure whatsoever, only a sign.
E) Waste management
//We agree with the proposal to transfer responsibilities for this issue to local governments, but we believe that the Environment Department and the Labour Inspectorate must ensure the supervision of the correct implementation of the legal framework governing this issue, with a specific accountability framework.
F) Water Supply and Sewerage Boards
//The proposal of the scholars on this point is not entirely clear, we would like them to be a little more specific as to which recommendations of the MANRE report they adopt and how they see the transition period in this respect.
//As the Citizens' Ecological Movement, we stress that it is absolutely necessary for the Ministry of Interior to proceed immediately with the implementation of the findings of the study requested and carried out for the merger of water supply and sewerage services some years ago;
//We believe that, in addition to the economic advantages of this move, there will be many similar environmental advantages that an island that regularly suffers from water scarcity must take into serious consideration
; //In general: Theaim of the new municipalities should be to decentralise as many competences as possible in order to better serve the well-intentioned interests of the citizen
//We understand that the transfer of powers should begin gradually so that there are no negative consequences in the exercise of these functions.
///It is equally important, however, not to lose the momentum that has been created and will assist in the transition to the new institutional framework.
// Below we set out our positions on issues that we believe need to be addressed in parallel if the process of local government reform is to be successful.
4. Degree of Autonomy & Financial Arrangements
//For us, the above two issues are inextricably linked and we would like to comment on them together.In order to create substantial autonomy for local government authorities, it is necessary to institutionalise their subsidy with a specific percentage from the state budget and to distribute the funds on the basis of an agreed formula to the local government authorities.
//Only in this way can the necessary support in terms of human resources and technical infrastructure be ensured to enable them to fully cope with their upgraded role;
// At the same time, however, the chronic financial problems facing local governments should be resolved and they should be given the opportunity to start with a clear financial balance sheet.
// The state should take over all outstanding loans of the local governments
// These loans were essentially repaid by the state grant anyway and if the restructuring is to have a chance of success, the new local government units should be able to operate under the most auspicious conditions.
//Of course, structures of transparency and strict accountability must be ensured by these authorities, both to prevent them from becoming over-indebted again and to combat corruption, favouritism and the violation of citizens' rights.
A.Strengthening internal audit procedures
//More rigorous and thorough internal control procedures should be established for both the new municipalities and the proposed local councils.
// To ensure the independence of both existing and new internal audit functions in local authority structures, we believe that they should be placed under the administrative control of the Internal Auditor and that this internal control should be carried out by the State Internal Audit Service.
// The rotation of internal audit officers should be ensured at regular intervals to ensure their objectivity and independence over time.
//In addition, we believe that the Internal Audit Service should assume responsibility for checking the legality of decisions taken by the municipal councils.
//We believe that the process of checking the legality of these decisions by the Ministry of Interior so far fails to prevent the abuse of power, no corrective measures are taken when mistakes are made, and above all, the infliction of huge financial losses from wrong decisions, which the innocent taxpaying citizen is then called upon to cover, is not prevented.
// The findings of the Internal Audit must be submitted to the collective bodies of the respective institutions for information and corrective action, and if this is not done within a reasonable period of time, then they must be sent to the Auditor General with notification to the competent Minister and the Attorney General's Office.
B.Strengthening the role of the Auditor General.
//The institution of the Auditor General should be further strengthened so that it can meet the increased demands of auditing the financial statements and operations of existing and emerging local authorities;
//The role of the Auditor General's office has so far been very constructive but more can be done if it is able to produce its reports in a shorter time frame
// and if the executive authority takes immediate corrective action in relation to its recommendations.
C.Establishment of Accountability of elected officials
/ / / It is necessary to finally institutionalize the legal and criminal liability of elected representatives of local government.
// We do not believe that it will be a disincentive to take up elected positions. On the contrary, it will be an incentive for people who understand the responsibility of their decisions to seek election.
5. Mode of operation (points 5.1 and 5.2)
//We believe that any revision of the way the ATAs operate must necessarily include the dimension of digital governance.
//Local authorities must be directly accessible to citizens and the most basic way to do this is by posting notices and minutes of municipal and community council meetings on their respective websites.
//We reaffirm once again that the Movement of Citizens' Ecological Cooperation fully supports the efforts to promote reform in local government and we hope that the renewed efforts of the Ministry of Interior to reform local government, under its new political head, will be successful.
6. Management of existing human resources
//The study finds that the new institutional framework will reduce the human resources employed in local government.
//We agree with the proposals set out to address the inherent problems that exist in relation to administrative and labour personnel in local government,
// but they have not proposed any measures to manage the people who will be effectively redundant from this process.
//We think that estimates should be given on how many fewer people they think will be employed
// and to provide parameters for an early retirement plan.
// One thought is that existing employees in local government should be considered as interchangeable staff to facilitate the movement of employees to where there is a real need (within the same administrative province unless they request another move).
//We reiterate our proposal for the creation of a central body responsible for the recruitment, promotion and transfer of officials (perhaps a development of the independent body that will be established to determine the new municipalities) to address both partisanship and the general favouritism that has been found to exist in local government.
7. Ensuring the legitimacy of institutional changes
//We believe that the proposed changes should be put to a referendum.
// We propose to take advantage of the upcoming European elections and put the framework that will be shaped before the people to ensure a harmonious transition to the new institutional framework.
//We believe that it is a basic right of citizens to have a say in serious institutional changes that directly affect them.
// The experts' proposals make reference to issues affecting local government and are included in the reports prepared for the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment and the Ministry of Health.
// We would like to express our dissatisfaction that the study was delivered in English, because the use of English instead of Greek was an obstacle to the full understanding of the contributions of the scholars, and we reserve the right to return to some issues, because we may have misinterpreted the text.
// We hope that the final study, despite the tight timeframe, will be delivered to us officially translated into Greek when it is completed.
// We also recall that the terms of reference given by the government to the experts for the study and the minutes of the experts' meetings with the minister are still pending, as he committed himself in our meeting.
9.5 Immigration Policy
//We believe that the Republic of Cyprus has been hopelessly delayed in drawing up a strategic plan to deal with the problem of economic and political refugees.
// The issue was not addressed on the basis of respect for human life and dignity,
// taking into account the specific conditions of Cyprus.
//An integrated strategy must be based on the following key principles: 1.Hosting and supporting refugees until their departure from the country in humane conditions.
//2.Acceleration of the procedures for the examination of the applications of economic and political refugees for the reduction of accommodation costs
// and the risk of illegal residence in Cyprus.
//3.Modernization and modification of the immigration policy so as not to violate the International Conventions and the European acquis.
//4.Taking measures to combat nationalism and racism, as well as against the intimidation of foreign students in schools and other public, common areas.
//5.Establishment of a policy to solve coexistence problems.
//Promote psychological and social support for foreigners in order to integrate smoothly into the social environment of our island.
//6.Many problems are created precisely because of the ghettoization of various groups of migrants (e.g. in Nicosia within the Walls, Larnaca)
// and the state refuses to address the problem directly and decisively and to accept the magnitude of the problem.
//A political decision must be taken on a strategy to deal with this phenomenon.
//7.Strict application of the legislation governing the renting of premises (shops and restaurants most of the time)
//and to take strict measures against the owners of the premises that rent them out.
// We propose to carry out regular checks on the number and living conditions of migrants in guesthouses
//and the intervention of social welfare services to protect the rights of minors and women.
//8.We support a benefit policy that covers the basic needs of applicants and recognised refugees
//without provoking the justified feelings of the locals, nor is it an incentive and lure to attract new economic migrants.
//9.Better implementation of border and Green Line security measures.
//10.Achieve bilateral agreements with surrounding and other countries from which migrants originate on preventive measures and on measures for refoulement.
//11.Promote European policies of return (especially with Turkey) and burden-sharing of migrants' presence.
//12.Promote European policies to remove the causes that drive these people from their homes and are the real root causes of the migration problem.
//Immigration policy should take into account that our country is under occupation.
//The real needs of the Cypriot economy should be assessed, especially in times of economic crisis and its potential for receiving migrants.
//There should be a limit to the number of migrants that a small semi-inhabited country can accept.
//Unfortunately none of these have been taken into account to date.
//Strict conditions must be set for the residence of migrants and community workers, e.g. learning the Greek language within a regular period of time for a smoother integration, legal employment, respect for the society where they live, etc.
//Stricter legislation to crack down on illegality, both for migrant and community workers and by employers.
// Regular audit of private employment agencies, study of the criteria for employing migrants and definition of occupations where there is a real demand.
//Horizontal implementation of collective agreements, whether it is a Cypriot or a foreign employer, in order to combat illegal employment and the replacement of Cypriots with cheaper labour.
// Protection of legal foreign workers from the exploitation of employers and "traders".
//The promotion of equal pay
// and the establishment of equal professional and social rights so that the rights of local workers are also protected.
// The numbers of domestic workers are too high.
//The money is a lot and nowadays, circuits have been created to exploit both their arrival and their stay in our country.
//The redefinition of the policy as recorded is not sufficient (economic growth, etc.).Barriers should be put in place so that only those who are really in need (elderly people, people with disabilities, etc.) are licensed.
//To be completely banned for those who bring in domestic workers for the purpose of running the household and use them as servants.
// This will open up jobs for locals.
// Foreign migrants approaching Cyprus through Turkish occupied Cyprus is a completely controlled and directed situation by Turkey.
//We should demand from the European Union that Turkey accept their immediate return to the occupied territories or else we should veto any agreement between Turkey and the European Union.
//In the meantime, those who come through the occupied territories should be automatically and directly driven through the barrier of Ledra Palace to the occupied territories.
//A campaign can be undertaken in countries of origin (e.g., newspaper advertisements) that Cyprus is not their choice because things have become stricter.
//Additionally, an exhortation not to pay the circuits because in most cases they are exploited and abandoned.
// Protection of the rights of political refugees. One of the major problems created by the situation is that the uncontrolled flow of foreigners and the indiscriminate reaction of society deprives the genuinely persecuted and fugitives of the support and protection they need and deserve.
//Combat trafficking in persons more vigorously.
//Stop the licensing of female artists.
// Beat the trafficking rings.
//Trafficking in persons also constitutes the action of certain lawyers (there is a legislative gap to combat this form of trafficking).
//Require the European force FRONTEX to patrol the northern, southern and eastern borders of the Republic of Cyprus.
// Suitable accommodation for the reception of asylum seekers and for the "detention" of those whose applications have been rejected and are awaiting deportation or refoulement.
10. TRANSPORT
10.1 Introduction
//In the transport sector, Cyprus holds yet another sad record in Europe.
// We are the country with the highest percentage increase in greenhouse gas emissions from transport during the period 19902008.
// Specifically, the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from transport in Cyprus (mainly private cars) during this period was 180% while the average in Europe was not more than 20%.
//In recent years, due to the economic crisis, greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union have stabilized.
//This sad performance should be a serious concern for us.
//The Cypriot traffic management model has led to the big vicious circle: more cars - bigger roads - even more cars, with the well-known negative consequences.
//The traffic problem in Cypriot cities has been exacerbated in recent years, causing a number of problems, such as: Substantial disuse of the road network due to traffic congestion; inconvenience, stress and loss of time; environmental pollution from car exhaust fumes; spending a large part of the Development Budget of the Republic of Cyprus every year on road works without rational traffic management.Waste of tens of millions of pounds every year as a result of excessive fuel consumption and wear and tear on vehicles; road accidents, causing huge human, material and social damage.
//The above problems are mainly due to the untimely implementation of the planning law, local plans and traffic infrastructure projects in cities,
//the anarchic development of cities,
//the lack of a specific policy to encourage alternative more environmentally friendly means of mass transport for the population
//and the pressure to expand development areas resulting in scattered development and dependence on the private car.
10.2 Traffic management measures
//1.Staggered working hours: Staggering the starting and ending hours of the different sectors of workers and schools can contribute in the right direction;
//2.More efficient use of the main roads, with strict enforcement of traffic regulations, especially with regard to illegal parking;
//3.Adopting a policy to encourage alternative soft modes of transport (public transport, cycling, walking) and constructing cycle paths and pedestrian walkways;
//4.Increasing the use of special route buses (e.g. to schools, industrial areas, etc.) to reduce the need for extensive use of private cars in the city;
//5.Allocate public transport priority lanes for buses, taxis and cars with three or more passengers, for fast passenger transport, without widening roads at the expense of existing sidewalks and yards;
//6.Reorganize traffic lights with systems that give priority to public transport and fire and ambulance vehicles.
//7.Launch a broad public awareness campaign and take institutional measures to raise the level of road and environmental awareness of citizens;
//8.Study the creation and operation of intercity public transport systems: trains, trams between cities;
//9.Ensure the safe movement of disabled persons;
//10.Promote ecodriving.
10.3 Measures for the development of public transport
//1.A well-organised network of urban, interurban and provincial public transport services must be built to meet the modern needs of Cypriot society, so that citizens can be served safely and reliably to the extent that they do not need their private car for their travels.
//2.Post timetables at public transport stops, publish information leaflets available at airports and other public places as well as on the internet, so that both the local population and visitors have the necessary information about all means of public transport.
//3.The network should have the infrastructure to serve all persons with disabilities,
// as well as people on bicycles.
//4.There should also be strict supervision of the companies providing public transport to ensure the uninterrupted operation of an efficient transport network that is dynamic to serve the ever-changing needs of passengers.
//5.Priority should be given to public transport when regulating traffic.
//6.To strengthen the institution of the school bus
//7.Public transport routes should also serve workers in industrial and craft zones.
//8.Create park & ride stations at the entrance of cities, where people can leave their cars and use buses to get to work in the city.
10.4 Measures to protect the rights of pedestrians and disabled persons
//1.Strict measures against illegal parking;
//2.Very strict fines for parking on the pavement, in disabled parking spaces and near pedestrian crossings
; //3.Create safe pedestrian crossings on all streets at distances of no more than 300 metres apart, regulated by traffic lights with traffic lights and audible signals for the blind
; //4.On dual carriageways, install dividing islands;
//5.Implement speed control measures on all roads passing through residential areas;
//6.Construct pavements everywhere, especially in areas where small children are being handled;
//7.Pavements are for the exclusive use of pedestrians. Take immediate legislative and other measures to keep pavements free from any obstructions;
//8.Create safe networks of cycle paths in all towns and villages;
//9.Create dedicated cycle/pedestrian networks for safe passage and access to primary and secondary schools for students;
//10.The above requires proper planning and adoption of a long-term sustainable strategy in the vital area of transport.
10.5 Measures to reduce pollution
//1.Adoption of modern methods of technical control of cars in a way that minimizes emissions of pollutants;
//Troubleshooting the problems created by the removal of the catalyst of unleaded petrol;
//2.Special provisions in the road projects under study, for the movement of buses, bicycles and pedestrians;
//3.Design and construction of modern bus stops and stations;
//4.Review of existing road network route plans through sensitive residential and commercial areas in the light of environmental impact studies;
//5.Design and construction of extensive and functional networks of cycle paths in all cities.
//6.Construction of sidewalks on all streets for safe and comfortable pedestrian and wheelchair traffic;
//7.Completion of urban traffic infrastructure projects;
//8.Ensuring that traffic infrastructure projects are compatible with local conditions;
//9.Promote a specific policy to develop the use of bicycles.
//10.Establish a special lane for bicycles on main avenues and interurban roads.
//11.Improve road surfaces.
//12.Create bicycle parking areas on the periphery, at the starting points and stops of urban transport.
//13.Creation of bicycle rental stations for short trips in city centres;
//14.Extensive network of cycle paths;
//15.Solutions to reduce the price (e.g. loans, subsidies) of bicycles;
//16.Strict observance of traffic rules by car drivers.
// Combat uncontrolled parking of cars in the street or on the sidewalk
//17.Instill traffic behaviour in car drivers.
// Improve the training and examination system for learner drivers.
//18.Implement a quality of life planning law.Strict implementation of the planning law as a means of rational development.
//Unregulated development leads to an aggravation of the problem and makes it more difficult to take corrective measures.
//19.Rational zoning of government offices and public spaces.
//Refuse the plans for the concentration of government buildings in Egomi.
//20.Conduct Environmental Impact Assessment Studies before final design of traffic infrastructure projects;
//21.Policy that promotes soft and mass transportation (bicycle, bus, tram, walking) in a way that will substantially improve the quality of life of citizens.
11.JUSTICE - INSTITUTIONS
11.1 Introduction
//The whole system of justice has been ailing for many years, resulting in the creation among the Cypriot people of a low sense of trust in the institution of justice.
// Justice, we all say, should be blind.
// What we have observed for many years is that it is blind only to the financially weak, and only sees and protects the few, the financially well-off, resulting in the disdain for the institution of justice by the Cypriot people.
// The corruption and influence that exists today in all levels of the judiciary is the result of the involvement of the big parties and not only, who want to have a say and control in all appointments in all levels of the judiciary.
11.2 Establishing strict criminal and civil liability
//In no case, a state official can avoid justice by hiding behind either immunity or an overly flexible rule of good administration.
//Our position is based on the principle of democracy as expressed by the International and European Courts, namely: Every citizen of the Republic of Cyprus is entitled to enjoy the principle of democracy, namely: EQUAL RIGHTS and EQUAL DUTIES.
//1.Withdrawal of immunity: All elected rulers, including the President of the Republic, must respect the institution or institutions they serve based on the obligations arising from the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Cyprus.
//2.Justice:With a view to the better and more efficient operation of our judicial system, the invocation of the Law of Necessity should be lifted and the Constitution should be reapplied as it stands.
// Hence required:The reconstitution of the Constitutional and Administrative Court
//The re-establishment of the Supreme Court with the jurisdiction of an appellate court for civil and criminal cases
//The establishment of a Court of International Commercial Disputes
//The establishment of a Court of First Instance for the imposition of direct penalties on offenders .
//Transparency in the recruitment and promotion of members of the security forces so that the best are promoted.
//3.Provision for the holding of a referendum at national and local level, such as local government, on all important issues relating to the survival and living of the Cypriot people as a whole, as well as at local level.
//4.Establishment of a provision that, in the case of a referendum where the result of the citizens' will is different from the decisions of their representatives, they should be immediately recalled and elections should be called.
//5.The demand for limiting to two consecutive terms the election of all the representatives of the People to the various offices. President of the Republic, Member of Parliament, Mayor, City Councillor, Community Mayor and Community Council Members.
//6.To limit the appointment of all state officials to two terms. Ministers, chairmen and board members of semi-governmental organisations, community leaders.
//7.Conducting audits of natural or legal persons and organisations exercising authority in the field of politics, administration and the economy of the country.
//8.To demand the punishment of the embezzlers of public money and the confiscation of their assets.
//9.To promote and demand the compulsory accountability of those exercising public political power and managing public money, at the end of their duties, putting all their assets as security until the acceptance of accountability.
//10.To demand an audit of the "behind-the-scenes" of the movable and immovable property of all those who have served as: presidents, ministers, ministers, members of parliament, mayors, municipal councillors, general directors of ministries, presidents of semi-governmental organisations and members of the boards of directors of semi-governmental organisations, from 1974 onwards.
//Until the audit is completed and a final court decision is issued, in case of judicial involvement, to request the temporary freezing of the real estate and movable assets involved.
//11.To call for an investigation in every direction, from 1974 onwards, to search for and impute administrative, civil or criminal - even those that have lapsed - responsibilities for the bankruptcy of Cyprus, with exemplary punishment for all those found guilty.
//12.The demand from the Parliament to finally open the Cyprus file.
//This is a shame and a dream for all governments and all parties from 1974 until today, who did nothing to assign responsibility to the perpetrators of the modern Cypriot tragedy, the results of which we live and live until today.
//It is an insult to the fallen and those who have suffered that justice is not done in time.
//It is a minimum tribute to the families of the victims, but also an obligation to the country to restore the historical truth, before it is too late, because in the course of time, one by one people pass away, both from the side of the victims and from the side of the culprits.
// and not to wait for the historian of the future, a hundred or two hundred years from now, to bring the truth to light as he wants, serving his own purposes and goals.
//13.The requirement for the formalisation, recognition and publication of all inheritance-trust accounts which exist and have been created for the benefit of the Republic of Cyprus and in general for the benefit of all Cypriots since December 21, 1961 with the participation of the Republic of Cyprus as the 74th member-shareholder in the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development, known as the World Bank, with a participation and contribution of 15 million dollars and the acquisition of 0.017% of the share capital of the said bank and the other affiliated The International Finance Corporation (IFC) since March 2, 1962 as the 61st shareholder member; the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) since April 12, 1988; the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) since December 25, 1966 as the 23rd shareholder member.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 21 December 1961 with the participation of the Republic of Cyprus as a shareholder member with a participation and contribution of $11.25 million and the acquisition of 0.017% of the share capital.Today the participation and contribution amounts to $158.2 million with 0.07% of the share capital.These organizations established under the Bretton Woods Treaty made on July 22, 1944 and ratified on December 27, 1945 by all the parliaments of the forty-four (44) founding member states.
//14.To investigate and hold accountable, all serving Presidents, Ministers of Finance, Governors and members of the Central Bank, Permanent Ambassadors to the United Nations of the Republic of Cyprus, who knew, signed and confirmed and confirmed every year since 1966 to date, the annual balance sheet of all these hereditary trust accounts which are for the benefit and use of the Indigenous Indigenous inhabitants of our country and have concealed and conceal their existence to this day.
//15.The use of these accounts, of any amount deemed necessary, after the audit of the public debt, for the repayment of all actual legal obligations of the Republic of Cyprus to third parties and the disengagement from the Memorandum and from any creditors.
//16.The use of these accounts, of any amount deemed necessary for the economic development of our country,
//as well as for the overall well-being of the Cypriot Indigenous Indigenous Cypriot inhabitants through the development of public utility projects.
//17.The requirement for the creation of a security mechanism, with properly trained personnel, technology and infrastructure, so that all Citizens of the Republic of Cyprus feel and are safe in their personal homes, schools, work and generally in all public places.
12.AGRICULTURE LIVESTOCK FARMING
12.1 Introduction
//The contraction of agriculture was the result of both the Turkish invasion and the development model that placed a one-dimensional emphasis on tourism and the sale of holiday homes (real estates development) and the removal of import restrictions due to the European course.
//Other reasons for shrinkage are the continuous effort for quantitative growth and the emphasis on monoculture, e.g. potatoes, vines, olives and citrus fruits.
// The result of this trend is that the majority of the products produced are of poor quality: a) large amounts of chemical residues from the use of pesticides, b) new varieties that taste and nutritional properties are not related to the corresponding traditional ones.
//The chain effects of the use of fertilizers, pesticides and biocides on land, water, air and health are a concern for society as to their necessity.
// We believe that the aim should be to maintain and expand the non-intensive (extensive) agriculture that exists on the island in order to preserve the agricultural mosaic that is very important for biodiversity, the good condition of the soil, not to pollute the water, etc.
// To do this, a restructuring of the incentives given through CAP subsidies is needed, and systematic implementation of legislation regarding prohibitions (e.g. grubbing up of bushes, etc.).
// Opportunities are also given through the implementation of the Multi-Compliance with regard to subsidies from the first pillar of the CAP
// and the implementation of legislation for the protection of birds (Birds Directive 2009/147/EC) and habitats (Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC).
// The lack of a serious and long-term policy and the relatively "non-existent" legislation create a big problem in the livestock premises.
// This is a problem which will exacerbate the reactions of the residents affected by the operation of livestock farms in large numbers.
// All intensive livestock farms should be assessed against environmental legislation to ensure that they meet all environmental criteria (which many certainly do not currently meet), including waste management.
// In addition, they should also be evaluated in relation to legislation concerning animal welfare which also several seem to be inadequate.
12.2 Agriculture
//We recommend the following:  1.The allocation of substantial funds for research, the introduction of know-how and the financing of applied programmes of organic farming and ecofarming;
//2.Setting standards, control and labelling of clean products;
//3.Continuous information and incentives for organic farmers;
//4.Informing the public about the importance of consuming such products (organic farming) and the important role of seasonality.
//5.Until the vast majority of agricultural products produced are clean, the aim should be to reduce pesticides and fertilizers immediately.
//6.Removing all pesticide selling outlets from residential areas (towns and villages).
12.3 Livestock farming
//1.Our society, if it wants to continue to have meat in its diet, should pay the real cost of meat;
//2.All farms producing livestock products must necessarily have all the means to reduce environmental pollution to a minimum (biological stations, buildings, etc.);
//3.What we say about agriculture in relation to "clean" products also applies to livestock products.
//In this sector, however, in addition to plant food, which should be free of pesticide residues, particular attention needs to be paid to the area of antibiotics and certainly to abstaining from administering hormones and other drug mutants.
//4.Parliament should amend and complete the legislation and take measures for its implementation in relation to the operation of livestock units in designated areas,
//as well as for social control by all stakeholders;
//5.Elaborate a policy for the utilization of livestock effluents.
12.4 Protection of the countryside
//The main objective is the revitalization of our villages (mainly the mountainous ones) not only as places for short trips or holidays but as living daily places for their permanent residents.
//1.The basic precondition is the safeguarding of economic life.
//2.Agrotourism can be a source of livelihood for some villages.
//3.Substantial incentives and facilities are needed for the implementation of ecological forms of economy and bioculture.
//4.A number of infrastructure projects that need to be done as well as financial incentives for young couples will encourage young people to return to the villages (e.g. subsidies for accommodation in mountain villages).
// The prerequisite, however, is the discharge from bourgeois ideology and the consolidation of human values.
//5.Informing rural farmers not to grub up traditional fruit trees or uncontrolled spraying of weeds.
13. INDUSTRY
//In 50 years of independence, successive governments have failed to create the right infrastructure for industry, both in terms of technology and in terms of preventing environmental problems.
// Moreover, today there is a shortage of labour force (especially of skilled labour) since on the one hand the orientation of the educational system and on the other hand the prolonged and almost exclusive subsidy of tourism, did not allow the creation of wage and other incentives for workers in the industrial sector.
// The industrial sector should be addressed on the basis of a practical acceptance of the need for a balanced development of all three sectors of the economy,
//in the perspective of sustainable development and taking into account environmental, social and cultural costs.
// In this direction, the institution of the Environmental Impact Assessment should: 1.
//2.To ensure the operation of industrial units on the basis of correct quality and environmental procedures, by employing the appropriate scientific and technical personnel, installing environmental control systems and effectively addressing the problem of air emissions and liquid and solid waste.
//3.Implement a comprehensive policy in relation to the management of toxic and other hazardous waste.
//4.Promote closed system waste management procedures with priority given to minimisation, reuse and recycling
//5.Promote the design of environmentally friendly (or more environmentally friendly) products, using appropriate technology and the parallel creation of reception areas for processing and recycling or energy recovery from waste and other materials discarded after first use.
//6.To promote the use of renewable energy sources in industry as well.
//7.Avoid overexploitation of local natural resources for the sake of exports (e.g. cement)
// and to avoid the establishment of industries that create nuisance and pollution
//8.Provide incentives for "clean" technologies.
//9.Expand the Industry Support Plan for pollution prevention.
//10.Incentives should be given to recycling plants, provided that the whole process is realistic and without other environmental impacts.
// In cases where this is not feasible, the possibility of cooperation with neighbouring countries and export to them of the materials to be processed/recycled should be exploited.
//11.Incentivise small industries to set up in communities where this can be done using local labour and local materials (decentralisation for revitalisation).
//12.To promote the cooperation of the University of Cyprus and the Cyprus University of Technology with the industry to investigate problems that exist and study ways to adapt the solutions offered.
//13.To create appropriately staffed and equipped laboratories to fill existing vacancies and cover additional needs.
//To create the appropriate infrastructure to ensure that their reliability assessment is correct.
//14.To create the necessary metrological infrastructure taking into account the specificities and needs of Cyprus.
//15.To strengthen the field of applied research in order to stop the simple introduction and adoption of ready-made solutions that are not always realistic for the Cypriot reality.
//16.To make effective use of local scientific potential and stop the massive import of foreign experts.
//17.Promote without further delay the creation of a high-tech industry.
14.ENERGY
14.1 Introduction
//Energy is the basic basis for the organisation of life at various levels;
//It is directly related to industry, transport, the domestic economy and generally enters into all aspects of the economic and social life of a place;
//Energy policy is the key to development plans and the social models towards which an organised society is directed.
14.2 Energy Policy
//1.Dependence of the energy sector on imported primary energy (currently oil, in the future natural gas).
//2.Irrational pricing policy and inability to introduce new forms of ecological pricing.
//3.Continuous increase of energy to meet mainly non-productive needs.
//In Cyprus, household energy consumption is very high and reflects the neo-pluralistic behaviour in our lives.
//The country's heavy dependence on oil undermines the economy and leads to tragic dead ends as we head towards the end of the oil era.
// The extraction of Cyprus' potential oil and gas reserves should be accompanied by the application of strict environmental protection standards.
//More forms of development that take into account renewable energy solutions should be encouraged.
//In no case should the use of nuclear energy be considered as an option.
//Research and scientific institutions (University of Cyprus, CUT, CUT, ETEK, Productivity Centre) and government agencies as well as political organisations and groups should be involved in order to design and operate as many on-site energy production units as possible based on Cyprus' conditions, such as photovoltaic and solar thermal parks, wind farms and others.
//The above mentioned institutions should participate in the strategic planning of our country on energy issues.
//We recommend: 1.To create an Energy Strategy Council.
//2.To cultivate awareness of our energy behaviour (lighting, televisions, radios, electrical appliances, heaters, water heaters, etc.).
//3.Have an energy policy in relation to vehicles or factories with high energy-consuming machines.
//4.Promotion of energy saving in all sectors (e.g. desalination).
//5.In construction, there should be a regulation for a higher thermal insulation coefficient in new buildings with similar incentives for old buildings.
//6.For a local energy production based on local data with the potential for decoupling from exogenous factors, aiming at the European Acquis of 20% of total energy to be produced from renewable sources by 2020.
//Exceeding the stifling targets set by Cyprus for the development of Renewable Energy Sources (13%) and setting at least 20% as a target for 2020.
//7.Saving 20% of total energy by 2020 by implementing a higher building insulation factor.
//8.Creating energy conscious citizens through continuous information campaigns and through programs and sponsorships.
//9.Information and labelling of electrical appliances with energy consumption and efficiency indicators and consumer education.
//10.Restoration of the Renewable Energy Grant Scheme
//and special incentives for solar systems (5000 solar roofs project for needy / large families).
//11.Reintroduction of the plan to scrap polluting and energy-intensive old cars.
//The ecological proposal is a proposal for a society with lower energy consumption and a renewable energy economy
// In 50 years of independence, successive governments have failed to create the right infrastructure for industry, both in terms of technology and in terms of preventing environmental problems.
// Moreover, today there is a shortage of labour force (especially of skilled labour) since on the one hand the orientation of the educational system and on the other hand the prolonged and almost exclusive subsidy of tourism, did not allow the creation of wage and other incentives for workers in the industrial sector.
//The industrial sector should be addressed on the basis of a practical acceptance of the need for a balanced development of all three sectors of the economy, in the perspective of sustainable development and taking into account environmental, social and cultural costs.
//To this end, the institution of the Environmental Impact Assessment should: 1.Be applied to industry, in a substantial way.
//2.To ensure the operation of industrial units on the basis of correct quality and environmental procedures, by employing the appropriate scientific and technical personnel, installing environmental control systems and effectively addressing the problem of air emissions and liquid and solid waste.
//3.Implement a comprehensive policy in relation to the management of toxic and other hazardous waste.
//4.Promote closed system waste management procedures with priority given to minimisation, reuse and recycling.
//5.Promote the design of environmentally friendly (or more environmentally friendly) products, using appropriate technology and the parallel creation of reception areas for processing and recycling or energy recovery from waste and other materials discarded after first use.
//6.To promote the use of renewable energy sources in industry as well.
//7.Avoid overexploitation of local natural resources for the sake of exports (e.g. cement) and avoid the establishment of industries that create nuisance and pollution.
//8.Provide incentives for "clean" technologies.
//9.Expand the Industry Support Plan for pollution prevention.
//10.Incentives should be given to recycling plants, provided that the whole process is realistic and without other environmental impacts.
// In cases where this is not feasible, the possibility of cooperation with neighbouring countries and export to them of the materials to be processed/recycled should be exploited.
//11.Incentivise small industries to set up in communities where this can be done using local labour and local materials (decentralisation for revitalisation).
//12.To promote the cooperation of the University of Cyprus and the Cyprus University of Technology with the industry to investigate problems that exist and study ways to adapt the solutions offered.
//13.To create appropriately staffed and equipped laboratories to fill existing vacancies and cover additional needs.
//To create the appropriate infrastructure to ensure that their reliability assessment is correct.
//14.To create the necessary metrological infrastructure taking into account the specificities and needs of Cyprus.
//15.To strengthen the field of applied research in order to stop the simple introduction and adoption of ready-made solutions that are not always realistic for the Cypriot reality.
//16.To make effective use of the local scientific potential and stop the massive import of foreign experts.
//17.Promote without further delay the creation of a high-tech industry.
14.3 Nuclear
//From its birth, the Ecological Movement has taken a clear position on nuclear issues. It opposed the view that wanted to divide them into war and peace.
//The movement grew after the Chernobyl accident, where it became clear that the danger of nuclear weapons is enormous.
//In our region a number of countries (Syria, Egypt, Israel), with Turkey being the most dangerous, are promoting nuclear projects.
//As the Ecological Movement we have an obligation to continue the struggle for the global abolition of nuclear weapons and the denuclearization of the Mediterranean.
14.4 Consumer rights
//We recommend: 1.To promote ecological agriculture and the creation of decentralized food production units, with the main purpose of quality and not only the increase of production, emphasizing the seasonality of products.
//2. Effective testing of perishables for pesticide residues, lead, etc.
//The current model of development and consumption is in question as it undermines the ability of our natural environment to provide the essentials for every household: clean water, clean air, fertile land and a variety of species.
//There is therefore a need to shift towards a consumption model that limits destruction, avoids overconsumption and the disposal of inappropriate products, reduces waste and its toxicity, improves the efficiency of water resources, energy for domestic use and road traffic and creates ecological awareness.
//Consumer awareness of what products contain, how they are produced, packaged, transported, sold and disposed of is essential. (e.g. toxic cleaning products can be replaced with non-toxic ones).
// The packaging can be recyclable and/or biodegradable.
//Product selection should be based on the criterion of being 'environmentally friendly' or at least less harmful.
// The preparation of an eco-labelling standard, its implementation and monitoring, together with continuous information and education and energy labelling, will equip consumers to make "green" choices.
//1.Consumer education for proper consumption, limitation of consumption, reuse, recycling.
//2.Provide relevant and timely information and information on products and services (CFC's refrigerators, air conditioning systems).
//3.Environmental assessment in comparative research and studies.
//4.Formulation of a policy for the disposal of household waste (medicines, batteries, recyclable materials, organics, toxic cleaning materials).
//5.Ecological and energy labelling.
//6.Provide alternatives to ensure the right to choose.
//7.Provide data on exhaust pollution near sensitive areas e.g. schools, restaurants.
//8.Regulating the media and advertising; effectively controlling misleading advertisements and claims and promoting patterns and models of over-consumption.
//9.Promote the ban on plastic bags (e.g. plastic bags given out in shops and supermarkets) which is now in force in many countries of the European Union, such as Italy, England, Belgium, as well as countries in the rest of the world such as Kenya.
// The ban on free bags within a short period of time has brought about major changes in consumer behaviour.
//There should be a relevant lesson in the very first grades of primary school that will orient children to the principles of proper nutrition and respect for nature.
// School canteens to have natural products in their canteens.
/ / / Also, advertising of products that are proven to be particularly harmful when consumed by children should be banned.
//People's health is precious, irreplaceable and worthy of respect.
//Insurance organisations have an obligation to inform and contribute to the prevention of diseases.
// An information, awareness and prevention policy on nutrition is necessary because we should be guided by the logic of prevention rather than cure.
// It is proven that such a policy has the effect of reducing the cost of healthcare while promoting the initiative of citizens to take responsibility for their own health in their own hands.
// For this reason, information centres for citizens on nutrition issues should be created and strengthened, including the learning of healthy nutrition on a practical level.
//To organise seminars to educate and inform those involved in the production and marketing of healthy foods and to make choices based on environmental criteria for all products.
//1.To create without delay the institution and the position of the Consumer Commissioner.
//2.Establish quality control at all stages of production of food and other materials.
//3. Establish regional testing laboratories.
//4.Complete the legislation on consumer protection.
//5.Modernise and orientate food legislation towards consumer protection and the production of truly healthy food.
//6.Strengthen ecological food production units.
//7.Strengthen and make the Competition Protection Committee (CPC) more flexible and faster in its decisions.
//8.Implement the legislation on the cap on basic consumer products.
//9.Implement the proposal of the Ecologists for the separate labelling of genetically modified foods.
15.EDUCATION
15.1 Introduction
//Pedagogy, inside and outside educational institutions, is called upon to make use of knowledge, history and culture and, by cultivating critical thinking and research, to consolidate existing knowledge and produce new knowledge, to create culture.
//In essence, education, by building on yesterday, creates today and opens the way for tomorrow, serving the vision of society.
//These objectives presuppose that the educational process is essentially democratic, based on respect for the individuality, national and cultural specificity of each member/group, and that it supports the cultivation of a humanistic and ecological consciousness.
//Our finding is that our education, regardless of the substantial contribution of educational institutions and individuals, does not meet the specific needs of the country;
//This is due to the lack of vision and the fact that our society has overturned human and cultural values.
// It has promoted imitation, xenomania, over-consumption, profit maximisation and commercialisation as models and 'values'.
// The blossoming para-education is called upon to fill the gaps in the content of educational programmes and their distortions.
15.2 Public Education System
//In order to improve our educational system we propose: 1.
//2.Establishment of positions for the promotion of educational researchers within the school units where the teachers in question will have both teaching and research duties.
//3.We support the establishment of the Academy of Education Executives
//4.To review the objectives and role of Vocational Education and Apprenticeship System.
//5.To create institutionalised institutions and a flexible and effective body for the definition of objectives and continuous monitoring of the curricula and their adjustment in the context of the needs of the place and the developments in the European area.
//6.Provide funds for functional and aesthetic upgrading of the school premises.
//7.Promote new architectural designs for school buildings that are energy efficient and aesthetically attractive.
//8.The operation of the University of Cyprus, the Open University and the Cyprus University of Technology is undoubtedly a significant development for the country.
//Admission to these educational institutions should be based on rules of equality and with examinations that are the same for everyone and not in a way that would undermine the principle of equal treatment.
//9.Funding of environmental awareness programmes through the possibilities provided by the EU.
//10.To establish incentives for teacher training according to the educational needs of each teacher.
//11.Appoint psychologists and sociologists in schools, not only to solve problems on the spot but also to teach courses in their speciality.
//12.To give all teacher candidates in Secondary Education and Technical Education the opportunity to receive pedagogical training before their appointment, with specific pedagogical subjects during their studies as was previously the case, if they wish to pursue the field of education.
//13.To protect the autonomy of the Universities while ensuring their connection with the specific needs of the country.
//14.To actively support the Open University, after its operation has been cleaned up and made compatible with the principles of open education.
//15.To ensure academic freedoms through a democratic function and dialogue within the University Community, with the institutionalized and effective participation of faculty and staff.
//16.To ensure full transparency in the recruitment and promotion of the administrative and teaching staff of Higher Education Institutions.
//17.We support the National Lifelong Learning Strategy 2014-2020.
15.3 Education and environmental awareness
//In a rapidly changing world, with small and large environmental and other problems in Cyprus, a renewed education and a lively, genuine, consistent education must be promoted.
// An environmental theme has been defined in schools which, fortunately, has not been limited to the framework of a single lesson but, rightly, extended through a set of lessons.
// Environmental awareness is the basic foundation for the formulation and promotion of any environmental policy.
//The establishment in society of values opposed to extreme consumerism and the development of quantitative factors, concerning quality of life and sustainability, remains the main concern of the environmental ecological movement.
//It is essential to acquire a comprehensive environmental sensitivity, because no measure of environmental protection or ecological management can and should not be based on coercion and imposition, but on substantial social consensus and acceptance.
//Environmental awareness-raising bodies should be everywhere.
// Of particular importance is the role of the media, which, while they have so far shown a great deal of sensitivity when it comes to the environmental movement's highlighting of environmental scandals, have generally proved to be weak in promoting real efforts to investigate, present and consistently promote the problems.
// We propose: 1.Funding of environmental awareness programmes through the possibilities provided by the EU.
//2.Promoting incentives for the overall engagement of citizens and the media on environmental issues.
//3.Creating a real framework for environmental education in educational institutions, in cooperation with environmental volunteers and environmental experts.
//4.Removal from textbooks of references that glorify the development model being followed (e.g. mass tourism, genetically modified, nuclear)
//and the addition of an environmental approach to the curricula and artistic activities for children e.g. music, art.
//5.Possibility of further training of teachers on environmental issues.
//The objectives and role of Vocational Education and Apprenticeship System should be reviewed.
//2.To create institutionalised institutions and a flexible and effective body for the definition of objectives and continuous monitoring and adjustment of the course within the framework of the needs of the place and the developments in the European area.
//3.Provide funds for the functional and aesthetic upgrading of the school premises.
//4.To provide funds from the state to build classrooms in schools and equip them so that they can be used for creative activities for students.
//5.To establish incentives for teacher training.
//6.To give teachers the opportunity to be trained in communication issues in order to be more effective in their work.
//To win someone, and therefore the student, you need to keep your distance from your system of perceptions, to put yourself in the student's shoes and understand him.
//7.To reduce the "violence" exerted by the school on students
// and to increase students' participation in decision making that affects them.
//8.Appoint psychologists and sociologists in schools, who will not only solve problems on the spot but also teach courses in their speciality.
//9.To enable all prospective teachers of secondary education and technical education to receive pedagogical training before their appointment, in accordance with the principles of adult education, under humane conditions, without having to leave their possible jobs and without having to travel several kilometres from their place of residence to their place of teaching, without having to suffer the inconvenience of having to travel several kilometres from their place of residence to their place of teaching.
//10.To protect the autonomy of the Universities while ensuring their connection with the specific needs of the country.
//11.To actively support the Open University, once its operation has been rehabilitated and made compatible with the principles of open education.
//12.To ensure academic freedoms through a democratic function and dialogue within the University Community, with the institutionalised and effective participation of faculty and staff.
//13.Ensure full transparency in the recruitment and promotion of the administrative and teaching staff of Higher Education Institutions.
15.CULTURE
//1.Separation of the Ministry of Education and Culture into two independent and autonomous units.
//The creation of a Unified Body for Culture, and the creation of a Cultural Planning Office in the Ministry of Culture.
//2.Organization and staffing of Culture by specialized scientists and experts according to the fields it will handle: e.g.Department of Antiquities, Department of the State Library, Department of Monuments Registration and Archiving, Department of Archiving, Preservation and Promotion of Popular Tradition, Department of Museums and Galleries, Department of Contemporary Artistic Creation Archiving, Department of Literature and Translation, Department of Publications, Department of Music and Dance, Department of Applied Arts, Department of Public Relations and Enlightenment, Department of Cinema and Theatre, etc.

//19.Establishment of an independent Cultural Authority.
//20.Theatrical production subsidy programmes with transparency and meritocracy.
//21.Application of the international treaties on geographical names.
//22.Promote the necessary coordination of all the competent bodies and the creation of mechanisms for direct intervention, protection and effective revival of our traditional heritage and essentialization of the role of the Handicraft Service.
//3.To undertake on a systematic and broad basis the education and awareness of the public about the value of our architectural heritage.
//24.Implement procedures for the effective control of building development in traditional residential areas and programmes for their effective revitalisation in terms of quantity and quality.
//25.Implement the provisions of the legislation concerning the protection of cultural heritage, by the Executive, the Local Government and any competent authority.
//This legislation incorporates the provisions of the International Conventions on Cultural Heritage to which the Republic of Cyprus itself is a signatory.
//26.Redevelopment and reconfiguration of public open spaces and creation of buildings to ensure quality and responsibility in their composition and construction and operation.
//Projects produced by the State itself must be equally subjected to quality and integrity control of operation and integration into the environment.

//The monuments should be respected and maintained.
//28.Promote legislation providing for the expropriation of areas of natural beauty, antiquities and cultural heritage sites.
16.ARCHAEOLOGIES
//The destruction of the culture and character of the island has a huge cost on the education and training sectors of the island.
//The field of modern Folk Art is completely neglected and in a few years the few remaining examples of authentic folk tradition will disappear.
//The responsibility for the destruction of the antiquities and consequently of the culture and character of the island lies with the legislature and the Government, which decide on the development plans of the country and place the preservation of our archaeological sites, the development and improvement of our Museums, as well as the preservation of our folk art in secondary importance.
//The existing legislation is inadequate and only suits development as the technocrat understands it.
//The perpetuation of a legislation that not only does not protect but also does not help or support the true needs of tradition and culture will bring about the destruction and alienation of the island with mathematical precision.
//1.The Department of Antiquities should be placed under the Ministry of Culture, which should be established without delay.
//2.The Ministry of Culture to become a substantial entity.
//3.To enact laws that cover the practical needs of archaeological/historical sites (maintenance, signalling, control).
//4.Establish a framework of legislation and create a body for the protection of Cultural Heritage (Ecclesiastical and Architectural)
//5.To enact laws governing excavations, their maintenance costs, publications, etc.).
//We also recommend: 1.Repatriation of all Cypriot antiquities through the established international regulations and conventions.
//2.The protection of our exposed antiquities and their dignified enclosure.
//3.Extension of museum visiting hours.
//4. Creation of thematic museums in selected communities.
//5.Increase of the resources of the Department of Antiquities and scientific staffing of the Department both in the central and provincial offices and museums.
//6.The inclusion of the preservation of our cultural heritage among the most important objectives in the five-year development programme.
//7.The appropriate staffing of the Department of Antiquities so that it can respond to the educational and social role that can be promoted through the Museums, which must popularize the subject of archaeology.
//Museums should also take an active role in the preservation of all our cultural heritage, both built, written and oral.
//8.The definition of protective rules, numerical limits for visitors, code of conduct in order to protect archaeological sites which should not be a cheap product for sale.
//9.The introduction of a Tax and the creation of a Heritage Fund. Only with the imposition of such a measure will it be possible to carry out in time the work of conservation and maintenance of archaeological sites that has been so delayed.
//The pace of destruction is such that it does not allow the introduction of other measures that would depend exclusively on government funds.
/ / / It is necessary for the government to intervene in the ratification of the tax and the arrangement of interdepartmental agreements so that the Department of Antiquities, as the appropriate body, has the flexibility to use the revenues and be able to plan for future projects for the improvement and maintenance of archaeological sites.
//10.The creation of a "Heritage Conservation Committee" as an advisory body consisting of archaeologists, historians, artists and select members of the private sector, whose mandate will be to supervise the Department of Antiquities and the Fund, work closely with the Department and work to raise public awareness of the conservation and preservation of antiquities.
//11.The participation of archaeologists and historians in the councils that decide on the tourism policy for the development of the area, and in general those that draw up the five-year development programmes.
//12.To prevent any projects that degrade and commercially exploit the tradition of the place, the ancient monuments and culture in general.
//13.The prevention of activities that may damage in any way the archaeological or historical sites of Cyprus (construction of the Nicosia Municipal Hall, construction of the House of Representatives, Eleftherias Square, hotels, restaurants etc. on or next to archaeological and other cultural heritage sites).
//14.Require that every archaeological site should have a guide who guides and informs visitors about the history and culture of the site.
//15.Separation of the Ministry of Education and Culture into two independent and autonomous units.
//The creation of a Single Culture Body, and the creation of a Cultural Planning Office at the Ministry of Culture.
//16.Organization and staffing of the Culture Department by qualified scientists and specialists according to the areas it will handle: e.g. Department of Antiquities, Department of the State Library, Department of Monuments Registration and Archiving, Department of Archiving, Preservation and Promotion of Popular Tradition, Department of Museums and Galleries, Department of Contemporary Artistic Creation Archiving, Department of Literature and Translation, Department of Publications, Department of Music and Dance, Department of Applied Arts, Department of Public Relations and Enlightenment, Department of Cinema and Theatre, etc.
//Premium all of the above sectors with significant funds to promote their specific objectives.
//17.Close cooperation between the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Energy, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism.
//Representation and promotion through the above ministries of contemporary Cypriot artistic creation.
//18.Establishment of a higher school of Fine Arts (Department of Painting, Sculpture, Byzantine Iconography, Ceramics, Engraving, etc.).
//19.Establishment of a State Higher School of Music and establishment of a professional choir as decided 5 years ago.
//20.Establishment of an Opera Organisation and the construction of an opera house or a Music Hall or a Cultural Hall, with its own opera school in accordance with international standards.

//33.Establishment of an independent Authority for Culture.
//34.Theatre production subsidy programmes with transparency and meritocracy.
//35.Application of the international treaties on geographical names
//36.Promote the necessary coordination of all the competent bodies and the creation of mechanisms for direct intervention, protection and effective revival of our traditional heritage and essentialization of the role of the Handicraft Service.

//38.Implement procedures for the effective control of building development in traditional residential areas and programmes for their effective revitalisation in terms of quantity and quality.
//39.The provisions of the legislation concerning the protection of cultural heritage shall be applied by the Executive Power, the Local Government and any competent authority.This legislation includes the provisions of the International Conventions on Cultural Heritage to which the Republic of Cyprus itself is a signatory.
//40.Redevelopment and remodelling of public open spaces and creation of buildings to ensure quality and responsibility in their composition and construction and operation.

//The monuments should be respected and maintained.
//41.Promote legislation providing for the expropriation of areas of natural beauty, antiquities and cultural heritage sites.
18. CULTURAL HERITAGE / ARCHITECTURE
//Years after the ratification by the Cypriot state of the European Convention for the Protection of Architectural Heritage, the historic architectural ensembles, unique symbols and testimonies of the historical continuity of the country, remain abandoned at the mercy of time and any small or large interests.
/ / / While in the northern part of our island occupied by the Turkish army, the looting and alteration of our cultural heritage is taking place in a conscious and methodical manner,
//In the free part of the island, the Cypriot state, despite its national and international obligations, is abandoning our architectural heritage in a constantly accelerating rate of deterioration that is now leading to its extinction.
//Besides the implementation of some piecemeal measures and incentives, both the Government and the Local Authorities fail to grasp the importance of the preservation of our Architectural Heritage for the country in the conditions it is going through,
// of this integral part of our culture, of our collective memory and identity.
//On the other hand, the modern architectural product is the result of the cultural product of today's man.
//The transformation of the cultural component of contemporary life is a necessary condition for a change in the contemporary built environment without diminishing the importance of the role of Architecture and all the Sciences and Arts in shaping the built environment and the level of quality and responsibility at which they operate.
//We recommend that: 1.The necessary attention be paid to the cultural issues of this place and that the importance of both the architecture and our cultural tradition in general be properly prioritized.
//2.Promote the necessary coordination of all competent bodies and the creation of mechanisms for direct intervention, protection and effective revival of our traditional heritage and the essentialization of the role of the Handicraft Service.
//3.To undertake on a systematic and broad basis the education and awareness of the public about the value of our architectural heritage.
//4.Implement procedures for the effective control of building development in traditional residential areas and programmes for their effective revitalisation in terms of quantity and quality.
//5.The provisions of the legislation concerning the protection of cultural heritage shall be applied by the Executive, the Local Government and any competent authority.This legislation includes the provisions of the International Conventions on Cultural Heritage to which the Republic of Cyprus itself is a signatory.
//6.Promote measures to ensure the creation of such public buildings and spaces that accept and do not exclude their citizen-users: whether they are public employees or students who need flexibility, creative communication in educational spaces, or disabled people who need ease of movement and contact, or any citizen who needs easy access to information and information.
//We also recommend the creation of welcoming waiting areas, ease of access and communication.
//7.Redevelopment and remodelling of public open spaces and the creation of buildings to ensure quality and responsibility in their composition and construction and operation.
//Projects produced by the State itself must be equally subjected to quality and integrity control of operation and integration into the environment.
//8.The cultural and architectural heritage is uniform throughout Cyprus (Ap. Andreas, Tekkes Larnaca, Fragoe Church, Armenomonastiron).
//The monuments should be respected and maintained.
//9.Promote legislation providing for the expropriation of areas of natural beauty, antiquities and cultural heritage sites.
19.SPORT
//Sport is part of our very life, so we should all have the opportunity to exercise.
//This will be ensured by: 1.creating open spaces for sports and recreation, the construction of a network of pavements and sidewalks with the necessary safe access, cycle path networks, the creation of open local gyms, by integrating sports activities into daily life, walking, cycling in daily commuting.
//2.With the equal treatment of men and women in sport.
//Men's teams get the lion's share of the funds in sponsorship and promotion.
//On the other hand, women's sport is used by the state to cover its debts or contractual obligations to the European Union and other organisations
.By the elaboration of a national multi-year program for the implementation of the saying "HEAL WITH HEAL WITH HEAL" by the creation of new sports facilities throughout the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, which will provide all assistance and support to all young athletes through organized nutritional and sports education programs, in order to achieve the maximum results through local, regional, national and international meetings, competitions and competitions
//4.By adopting a strategy to instil the principles of fair play in our young people
//5.By adopting preventive measures to combat violence on the pitch through special programmes in schools and through sports clubs and other sports bodies
.We insist on a fairer distribution of state funds in many sports and an end to deficit funding of football;
//7.Schools should also be provided with changing rooms and other facilities to encourage sporting activities of students.
20.HEALTH
20.1 Introduction
//One of the negative effects of the frightening change in living conditions, the refugeeisation and urbanisation of a large part of the population is the decrease in the adaptability of the human organism, resulting in an increase in chronic diseases (rheumatological, allergic and other autoimmune diseases).
//To overcome the deadlock of established medicine we propose: 1.Promotion of an Insurance Fund and a General Health System with universal participation of all the people, without leaving windows for exceptions.
//2.Democratic control of all procedures and limitation of doctors' self-reliance.
//Control of Private Medical Care Funds.
//3.Consistent implementation of a proactive environmental policy with enforcement and strict adherence to sanitary standards through appropriate planning.
//In matters affecting General Health, Environmental Impact Studies must be supplemented with Health Impact Studies.
//4.Creating institutions that promote and control the quality of medical education and care and at the same time give the masses the opportunity to participate in the formulation of state health policy.
//An important role in this can be played by patient and friend associations with critical knowledge about specific diseases.
//5.Creation of autonomous decentralized Health Centres in which medical and paramedical staff will cooperate equally with other specialists (social workers, psychologists, engineers, etc.) in order to apply preventive and advisory medicine and the comprehensive approach to the issue of General Health and the promotion of health education.
//6.Promotion and implementation of alternative and other forms of medical care and study to encourage folk/traditional medicine.
//7.Combating the social reasons that lead people to self-destruction through mass drug addiction, i.e.(i.e. addiction to legal toxins (alcohol, nicotine and psychotropic drugs) of epidemic proportions, by supporting the creation of rehabilitation/detoxification units operating with harmless, non-toxic, holistic methods based on collective community, social engagement and addressing the psychological factors leading to addiction.
20.2 General Health System GHS
//The health system that exists in Cyprus and the proposed General Health System represents the established medicine as opposed to preventive medicine.
//The current impasse in the health sector is due to the commercialization that exists in this sector.
//There is a huge gap between what is useful, sensible and economical for the Social Welfare System and what is profitable for a medical practice, for the Health Funds and for private hospitals.
//The political top, satisfying individual interests, has led to painful deadlocks in the health sector.
//Political leaders are not able to show a pioneering spirit in order to achieve the ideal medical care with the sparing use of available financial resources.
//The State, essentially wanting to withdraw from its funding obligations in this sector, proposes a Health System without changing anything essential in the philosophy of established medicine.
//We need to create a General Health Plan that sees people, social and environmental conditions as communicating vessels,
//with the aim of reducing and ultimately overcoming social inequality in this area as well.
//The substitutionary solution is that Health Care System that works without profit, that is able to take care of the weak and the needy, that can work really efficiently with low costs.
//In our conception, the Geysy must contain the following: 1.It must be a plan that provides full coverage to all residents of Cyprus.
//2.Contributions should be income-based so that the lower economic strata can be covered equally with the higher ones, and those who can contribute more to cover those who have less or cannot contribute at all.
//3.To take care of all patients, and provide all possible services.
//4.If they are not provided at this time in Cyprus to promote agreements with European companies to offer them to us.
//5.The Republic of Cyprus has made a very large investment in public hospitals and does not want this investment to go to waste.
//Private hospitals have shareholders who invest and expect profit.
//Cypriot democracy has invested in public hospitals and we want to safeguard our investment.
//6.We want to see cooperation between the public and private sectors to complement each other's services, but at the same time we want to ensure that the services already provided are not lost, if not upgraded by the public sector.
//7.Self requires synergy not only between private and public hospitals but also with NGO organisations that currently provide alternative treatments not offered by the public sector.
//8.We want access to alternative therapies, both homeopathy, reflexology, acupuncture and mental health therapies such as art therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy.
//Patients should have the right to choose which treatment or recovery they prefer and this means access to alternative treatments.
//9.Full coverage without abuse of power.
//10.Transparency and accountability when problems arise.
//11.Ensure transparency and legislation to allow medical malpractice to be prosecuted.
//12.It must be a system where the citizen has immediate medical coverage, overcoming huge delays and bypassing time-consuming consultations when there is an immediate medical need.
//13.Upgrading first aid services and access to rural areas.
20.3 Genetically modified organisms and products
//1.To ban all cultivation of genetically modified organisms on our island.
//1.To declare Cyprus a country free of genetically modified organisms.
//2.To ban the use and import of genetically modified feed and seeds.
//3.To promote ecological agriculture and organic farming.
//4.Topromote cultivation for livestock plants suitable for the production of feed free of genetically modified organisms.
//5.To implement the law we promoted and passed since 2012 that provides for the placement of products containing Genetically Modified Organisms on separate shelves in supermarkets and kiosks, etc.
20.4 Health in old age
//The health problems faced by the elderly do not receive the attention and interest that they should receive from the State and the Ministry of Health;
//The institutions that exist for the care of the elderly are few and inadequate to offer decent living conditions
//and are accessible only to people with high financial incomes (even in the new Nicosia General Hospital there is no geriatric ward).
20.5 Smoking
//Lung cancer is the leading cause of death and smoking is the biggest culprit;
//Nicotine addiction, and in particular smoking addiction among young people, is a problem that needs to be addressed immediately;
//The Ecological Citizens' Coalition Movement adopts the following conclusions of the World Conference on Lung Cancer held in Tokyo.1.Promote new methods to prevent smoking among children and thus prevent them from becoming addicted to nicotine.
//Increase the tax on tobacco products.
///2.Strict enforcement of the law prohibiting smoking in all enclosed public places.
///3.Public education and anti-smoking education on the harmful effects of smoking;
//4.Promote the implementation of legislation and awareness-raising in workplaces, learning and recreational areas, as well as the protection of passive smokers;
//5.Implement a General Strategic Plan to address the consequences of smoking.
20.6 Electromagnetic fields (EMF)
//Epidemiological studies abroad show an increased risk of leukaemia in children aged 14 and 15 living near high-voltage pylons and telecommunication antennas;
//With the possibility that the health of the person near EMFs is affected, the approach of prudent "prevention" is adopted, i.e. avoiding the proximity of people to EMFs;
//The placement of telecommunication antennas at a distance of less than 300 m from schools and places where children and elderly people are frequented should be prohibited.
20.7 Patients' rights
//With the evolving situations in the medical system, patients must be legally protected;
//The Movement of Ecological Citizens' Cooperation supports the faithful implementation of the legislation on the Charter of Patients' Rights, which must also practically guarantee the rights of all patients and upgrade their service by creating a service within hospitals to serve patients and reduce the inconvenience they suffer.
20.8 Heart diseases
//In Cyprus, heart diseases are the biggest reason for loss of life and the costs of care are enormous.
//Prevention will save lives and therefore we ask for the creation of local clinics at public expense with the aim of a) guiding and educating citizens on how to live a better life, b) teaching physical exercises to improve heart function and c) diagnosing heart diseases.
20.9 Cancer
//Cancer is increasing in Cyprus and worldwide, mainly due to environmental factors.
//It affects men, women and children of all ages and social classes and is now the leading cause of death worldwide.
//The Movement of Ecologists for Citizens' Partnership played a leading role in the adoption by the government of the national cancer strategy in Cyprus, after long discussions.
//Although it does not fully reflect the ecological approach to cancer, the national strategy emphasises prevention as the most effective and efficient method of cancer treatment.
//It also provides for actions in the areas of early diagnosis, treatment, palliative care and research.
// However, the government has not only failed to implement the measures foreseen in the national cancer strategy, but often acts contrary to the spirit and letter of the national strategy: for example, it allows the operation of carcinogenic facilities (e.g. petrol stations) in residential areas
//and "disappears" radiotherapy machines instead of equipping public hospitals, thus raising reasonable suspicions that it favours private monopolies.
// With the aim of substantially reducing cancer morbidity and improving the quality of life of cancer patients, the Ecological Citizens' Movement will continue to dynamically promote the implementation of measures for cancer treatment.
//1.Application of the precautionary principle to drastically reduce the exposure of the population to carcinogens
//2.Create a comprehensive cancer registry to support the design of cancer prevention and treatment policies.
//3.Operation of a tertiary oncology reference centre at the Nicosia General Hospital, since it is the only one that includes all specialties
//4.Creation of a specialized breast centre, based on the relevant European guidelines.
//5.Gradual creation of regional oncology units in public hospitals.
//6.Strengthening palliative care.
//7.Promotion of alternative treatments, scientifically documented
20.10 Poison Control Centre
//The lack of an organised Poison Control Centre in Cyprus is an unacceptable absence.
//The establishment and operation of a Cyprus Poison Control Centre is a priority for the Movement of Ecologists and Citizens' Co-operation.
21.PROTECTION OF THE MAN-MADE AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
21.1 Air pollution
//The main source of air pollution in Cyprus is emissions from public transport in the cities and certain industries (power plants, cement plants, brickworks, quarries, etc.) and dust in the atmosphere.
//Cyprus has a high rate of private car ownership and use and the total number of cars is increasing at a high rate.
//To date, no substantial measures have been taken to limit pollution from cars nor is there any comprehensive and systematic counting
; /// Cyprus also has high levels of suspended solids and consequently poor air quality
; //The operation of some air pollution measuring stations is a start which should be strengthened;
// We look forward to: Substantial operation of the Air Pollution Control Board;
//This advisory body (Government Scientists Environmentalists etc.) will develop programmes and recommend measures for control and mitigation of air pollution;
//2.Strengthening (resources and staff) of the Industrial Pollution Control Agency (Ministry of Labour);
//3.Expansion of the network of air pollution measuring stations in cities and the countryside;
//4.Promotion of traffic restriction measures/strengthening of alternative means of transport;
//5.Control of motor vehicles/control of exhaust gases on the road;
//Control and regulation of motorcycles;
//Implement legislation to ban heavy vehicles from entering city centres;
//6.Adoption of infrastructure measures (control of catalysts, dumping sites);
//7.Procedural policy measures to limit fuel use;
//8.Establish standards and methods for controlling central heating burners;
//9.Systematic research into the presence of lead and dioxins in foodstuffs due to air pollution;
//10.Measures to reduce air pollutant emissions from industry and livestock farms;
//11.Adoption of air quality standards in enclosed areas (offices, home offices, industry, sports grounds) and establishment of direct measurement mechanisms;
//12.Establishment of a special emergency response unit;
//13.Removal of nuisance industries, laboratories and other businesses (e.g. oil product disposal stations) from areas adjacent to residents and their relocation to rationally planned areas outside towns and villages, e.g. Astrasol.
21.2 Forests
//Forests are a basic natural wealth for the island.
//The largest percentage of forest areas (90%) is state land and the responsibility for its preservation belongs to the state.
//Despite the tireless efforts of the Department of Forests, forestry associations, other organized associations and citizens for the preservation of our forest wealth, unfortunately the existing legal framework governing the protection of state and private forest land is inadequate.
//We reduce the degradation of our forest wealth from: 1.Extensive forest fires.2.The conduct of incompatible activities in forest areas (quarries, roads, logging, rallies, aerial spraying).3.Climate change.4.The lack of an effective legal framework and adequate provisions and information on issues concerning sensitive factors of forest wealth (endemic plants, perennial trees).6.The allocation of forest land for roads, buildings and facilities (e.g. Athalassa Forest).7.The inappropriate planning in some cases and the implementation of public works by the Forestry Department itself.
//1.Substantial strengthening of the Forestry Department, especially those services that deal with the study and protection of the natural wealth (forest flora) of our country, in terms of personnel, means, infrastructure, etc.
//2.Development of research and the creation of a data - information bank.
//3.Upgrading the management of forests and protected areas.
//4.Carry out environmental studies prior to the preparation of the final design for any project in or near a forest area.
//5.Immediate registration and mapping of all forested private lands and information on the incentives available for their protection and good management.
//6.Intensify the information of agricultural land owners about existing financial incentives for their conversion to forest land.
//7.The restriction of the introduction of alien flora species in forest areas.
//8.Review of quarrying zones and quarrying privileges with the aim of the definitive removal of quarries from forest areas and the preparation of studies for landscape restoration.
//9.Taking measures against the erosion of mountainous forest areas.
//10.Expansion of forest cover by declaring gravel land as State Forests and its reforestation.
//11.Strengthening fire-fighting measures by increasing the number of direct fire-fighting stations.
//12.Recognition and support of voluntary firefighting groups and associations.
21.3 National parks and protected areas
//The legislation for the establishment and management of National Forest Parks and protected areas is inadequate and anachronistic and not in line with international standards.
//We do not believe that areas declared as such are governed by a comprehensive protection regime, since the competent authorities are weak and powerless due to the incomplete legal framework.
//We recommend: 1.Modernization of legislation in accordance with international standards (I.U.C.N., F.N.N.P.E.).
//2.Strengthening of the Forest Parks and Protected Areas Sector of the Forestry Department and staffing it with appropriately qualified scientific personnel.
//3.Conducting a programme and studies for the declaration of Forest Parks and Protected Areas.
//4.Conducting studies and programs for the management and protection of the above areas.
//5.Establishment of a management committee for Forest Parks and Protected Areas, where, in addition to the staff trained for this purpose, representatives of environmental organisations, local authorities and citizens will participate.
//6.Reconfiguration of the Commission for Nature and implementation of management programmes for Natura sites.
//7.Completion of the Natura 2000 network on land in 2011 and at sea by 2014.
//8.Completion of the Management Plans for Natura 2000 network sites, indicating the Conservation Objectives for the species and habitats of the sites, the permitted and prohibited actions and accompanied by financial measures for the implementation of the management and monitoring of the sites.
//As regards the Natura 2000 Network, it is noted that it includes both the Bird Areas (Birds) and the Habitats Areas (Habitats).
//9.Monitoring of sites and species present in Natura 2000 sites.
//10.Strict application of the Due Diligence procedure for projects and programmes that may affect the conservation objectives of Natura 2000 sites and provision of compensatory measures if the conditions of Overriding Public Interest are met.
//11.Implementation of management measures for Natura 2000 sites.
//12.Financial measures and funds for the implementation of management and monitoring in Natura 2000 sites.
//13.Campaign to inform the public about the benefits of the Natura 2000 Network and eliminate the negative myths circulating about the Network.
//14.Modification of the financial measures mainly from the Rural Development Fund in order to favour landowners within the Natura 2000 network and to manage their land in a favourable way.
21.4 Acamas
//The Akamas issue is one of the issues that the Cypriot ecological movement has been dealing with since the first day of its creation.
//The long delay in the implementation of a substantial protection plan for the area has resulted in the continuous gradual degradation of the Akamas environment,
//but also the justified reaction of the communities, since without a clear development framework it is very difficult to plan and design their future.
//The area must finally be protected, and this is the demand of all Cypriots.
//To this end, the following should be done: 1.Establishment of a management committee with the involvement of all interested communities and institutions for the practical implementation of the management plan.
//2.A substantive and nominal policy decision that excludes tourism development in the more sensitive coastal areas of Akamas, such as Toxeftra Lara and Fontana Amorosa.
//This will remove the pressures and pretexts that prevent a consensual solution from being found with the majority of the inhabitants of the area.
//3.We request the inclusion of the area to be designated as Natura 2000 in a national park.
//4.The enclosed parcels that will be created within the Akamas National Park should be expropriated in order to provide total protection of the peninsula within the park.
//5.We call for the effective protection of the peninsula with an appropriate management plan as a Natura2000 area.
//6.We demand full respect and implementation of the obligations of the Republic of Cyprus to the Aarhus Convention, which ensures the participation of citizens in decision-making processes concerning environmental issues and the right of access to information held by public authorities on environmental issues.
//7.We call for agri-tourism development in the area so that the communities in the area can have a better life
//and support for the promotion of traditional Cypriot culture.
//It is important to promote the area as an alternative destination for tourists visiting the island, not only to benefit the residents themselves, but also for Cyprus to be able to boast that it can offer many, substantial and alternative options to its visitors.
//8.We express serious concerns about a mammoth project planned to be built by a company of the former President of the Republic in Peyia, Paphos.
21.5 Fauna Hunting
//Animals feel pain, cold, heat as well as fear, distress and hunger so we must treat them with love, not treat them as ornaments without rights and protect them from disease, torture or abuse.
//We are against the exposure of animals in zoos and their use in circuses, dolphinariums or any scientific experiments for the pharmaceutical or cosmetics industry etc.
//As for the wild animals and the fauna of the area in general, it is drastically reduced in species and number,
// in the absence of comprehensive, scientific statistics on the population of wild species.
//Human beings have a moral obligation to oppose the capture, poisoning and killing of wild animals and the infliction of pain and suffering on them.
//Population control of the numbers of certain fauna species where necessary should be done by non-lethal methods but by controlling reproduction or other means.
//We consider the following to be unacceptable for the fauna of the area: 1.The possibility of legal or illegal hunting during most of the year.
//2.The mass killing of birds (especially during the nesting season) with modern technology.
//Figures from the Birdlife Association indicate that approximately 12 million birds are killed every year in various ways (legal and illegal hunting, poaching, nets, poisoning).
//We support efforts to tackle the illegal bird trapping that has plagued and exposed our country for years.
//3.The pollution of the countryside as a consequence of mass "warfare" from cartridge lead, bag litter, scattered empty cartridges and scrap materials, noise, fire starting.
//4.The Government's failure to comply with the contracts it has signed, as is the case with the practice of Spring Hunting.
//5.The commercial import of animals and birds for hunting and ornamental purposes.
//6.The sale of animals, birds, corals, shells etc. protected under the CITES Convention.
//7.The poisoning of wild animals e.g. foxes, reptiles and vultures.
//8.The behaviour of certain hunting organisations which perpetuate the unacceptable hunting behaviour of some of their members.
//9.The practice of breeding animals by the government hunting agency and releasing them into the environment to become future victims, without taking into account the fact that they have not acquired the skills to survive in the wild and without taking into account the impact on the environment.
//10.The public remains uninformed and therefore uninterested in our national fauna.We urge the government to promote public education in specific areas such as e.g. labelling, identification of different species of birds, the interdependence of different species and the food chain.
//11.Poor management of fauna habitats (e.g.Larnaca and Limassol Salt Lake with the expansion of the airport and the delay in adopting a management plan for protection).
//12.The extensive destruction of wild vegetation habitats due to fires and land clearance for agricultural or other exploitation (e.g. Lake Paralimni).
//13.Irresponsible use of pesticides on crops and aerial spraying.
//14.The unacceptably high number of licensed hunters and lack of strict regulations and criteria for obtaining a license.
//15.The illegal hunters.
//16.Protected areas are not usually selected according to scientific criteria, but are subject to bargaining with hunting clubs.
//We recommend: 1.Long-term planning with specific objectives, policy definition and the creation of effective implementation, control and monitoring mechanisms.
//2.Upgrading of the Game Service to a Fauna Protection Service, strengthened in scientific and other personnel to formulate thorough programmes for the protection of fauna and not "game".
//3.The fight against poaching and illegal bird trapping needs special support.
//4.Abandon any idea of allowing the hunting of wild boar.
//Keeping in full our positions in relation to hunting, as a totally unacceptable ecological activity in the way it is carried out in Cyprus today, and until we as a society manage to overcome the stage of inhuman and cruel treatment of Nature, we suggest taking measures to reduce hunting through legislative measures and environmental education.
//We are not anti-hunters, but we believe that the way and scale in which hunting is currently conducted is unacceptable, exposes us as a society with backward attitudes, and perpetuates a negative and antagonistic relationship between humans and animals.
21.6 SeaActs
//Our island's marine area faces various risks and interventions from: 1.Pollution from land-based sources (such as industrial or domestic waste, plastics, fertilizers and other wastes) and pollution from ships (such as oil, oil and other wastes).2.Exploitative fishing and uncontrolled fishing.3Construction of projects (jetties, breakwaters, breakwaters, marinas, etc.) without adequate study and without taking into account the chain reactions in marine ecosystems.4.Illegal beach encroachment (e.g. sand extraction, occupation of beaches for commercial purposes).5.Construction of the coast and/or destruction of the vital natural resource, by residential and tourist facilities.6.Lack of serious study of measures to protect marine and coastal ecosystems.7.Construction of vertical and parallel breakwaters.
//We recommend: 1.Substantial amendment of the law on beaches so that it is in line with the well-understood interests of all citizens and not with the personal profit of tourism and other businesses.
//2.Substantially strengthen the services involved in the control and protection of the maritime zone.
//3.Taking substantial measures for the redevelopment of coastal areas, especially in areas of residential and tourist development.
//4.Promote and implement a study of the coastal works already built (some may have to be demolished).
//5.Enforce serious legislation on beach pollution.
//Encourage initiatives by various stakeholders to avoid littering of beaches.
//6.Revision of the coastline contour.
//Redesignation and redefinition of the beach protection zone with measures for its observance.
//7.Adopt more effective fishing legislation and implement existing legislation.
//8.Implementation of international conventions to protect the Mediterranean Sea from both marine and land-based sources of pollution.
//9.More active participation of Cyprus in European programmes for the Mediterranean.
//10.Implementation of the Barcelona Convention on Integrated Coastal Zone Management.
21.7 Marines
//Marinas are seen as yet another spasmodic project in the course of the disastrous tourism development for the arrival of "quality" luxury tourism.
//The proposed number and sizes are yet another expression of the tendency towards gigantism which will inevitably alter the landscape aesthetically since it will be in contrast to the scale of the site.
//The economic viability is questionable, because, among other things, the huge environmental costs are not taken into account in the investment expenditure.
//The environmental destruction caused by the extraction of boulders for their construction and the ecological disturbance and degradation of the marine and submarine environment from pollution and changes in sea currents is very high.
//The existence of a number of safe anchorages to serve the basic needs of Cypriots and a number of foreign sailors is acceptable, but strictly under certain conditions.
//A study should be made of the potential number of sailors and their real needs in terms of the facilities that the anchorages will have.
//These safe anchorages should be built on a reasonable scale in or near existing harbours or in environmentally degraded areas.
//Use and mooring charges should be unsubsidised and fully reflect operating and capital costs; the latter should include environmental costs.
//At the same time, the deliberate and continuous degradation of Larnaca Marina must be stopped
21.8 Animal welfare
//Based on the situation in Cyprus so far, we believe that the Cypriot state and society cannot be proud of their stance on animal welfare and protection issues.
//On the one hand, the state is unable to adopt and implement bills that touch the essence of animal welfare, or even to implement the existing legal framework, and on the other hand, the Cypriot society does not seem to change its mindset on these issues
.// We therefore propose the following:   1.Revise the existing legal framework to strengthen the protection of animal welfare and introduce more severe penalties;
//2.Create an Independent Body/Agency for the Control and Protection of Animals;
//3.Create a Special Fund for this purpose, funded by annual subscriptions to the Municipalities, dog registration permits and donations;
//4.Fund public awareness programmes, cat and dog neutering programmes.
//5.Better control of euthanasia.
//6.Creation of a Central Service (animal control) which will operate 24 hours a day.
//7.Creation of a nationwide number which will refer to the neighbourhood police officer for handling complaints.
//8.Simplification of the procedures for issuing court warrants for entry into apartments and houses / amendment of the law to abolish court warrants (see the law on Thera).
//9.Increase of penalties for animal abuse and mistreatment.
//10.Promotion of law on breeders, animal shelters, pet shops.
//11.Reopening of the cat sterilization program.
//12.Prohibition of the use of electric collars.
//13.Abolition of the triple form for dog registrations.
//14.Abolition of the traces tax or reduction of it when it comes to sending an animal for adoption abroad.
//5.Creation of a legislative framework for animal funeral homes.
//16.Enrichment of the curriculum taught in schools in the context of environmental education.
//17.Introduction of information contracts when transferring animals about the particularities of the animal to be acquired and the quality of life it should provide.
//18.Creation of an Animal Park with the contribution of animal welfare organisations (on state land, voluntary labour supply, creation of cafes).
//19.Prohibition of importing animals that are not compatible with the ecosystem of Cyprus.
21.9 Water resources
//Water resources are limited and the variations in the distribution of rainfall are large.
//This is why the cost of water is very high due to the construction of dams, desalination plants and the transfer of water from one region to another (even from Greece)
//The construction of the dams has caused great damage to the environment and ecosystems.
// Also the over-pumping of groundwater results in the influx of seawater.
//However, the use of water (mainly in agriculture and tourism) is indiscriminate as if Cyprus' water resources are inexhaustible and are "donated" to us without the real environmental price and the tens of millions of euros fine that Cyprus pays to the EU.
//We recommend: 1.The strengthening of the Department of Water (which now operates under the heavy title "Water Authority") with personnel and means to be able to effectively deal with the additional responsibilities assigned to it.
//2.Protection of ground and surface waters from the potential for pollution by pesticides, sewage, garbage.
//3.Strict enforcement of regulations to avoid over-pumping of groundwater.
//4.Pricing of water based on the actual cost of water (including environmental costs) to prevent abuse.
//5.Improvement in irrigation methods for more efficient use of each water unit.
//6.Avoiding water waste in irrigation and proper management of treated wastewater.
//7.Not to supply water from dams and other government irrigation or water works for golf courses for any consideration when severe restrictions are imposed on the citizen and when there is always a risk of a prolonged drought.
//8.Reduction of significant losses from water supply systems.
//9.Rational use of water to avoid the need for desalination with all the environmental problems and excessive energy costs that this entails.
//10.Water projects only if ecosystems and sustainable development are safeguarded.
//11.Develop a timetable for changes in agricultural crops based on water data.
//12.Priority to environmental and not micro-political criteria.
21.10 Liquid waste management
//The Ecological Movement believes that the current fragmentary way of managing wastewater is not effective in achieving the objectives of: 1.Improving the standard of living mainly in urban and tourist areas
//2.The protection of the natural environment (groundwater, sea).
//3.The efficient reuse of treated water.
//Recommendations: 1.Prioritization of priorities based on environmental/social/techno-economic and not on party criteria.
//2.Accelerate the establishment of sewerage systems in all cities and sensitive areas.
//3.Standardisation of procedures so that projects are not delayed.
//4.Close monitoring of the operation of wastewater treatment systems for any pollution of the receiving water.
//5.Modernization of legislation within the EU framework regarding toxic waste, sludge management, transport of sewage.
//6.Fixed time frames for polluting industries to treat their waste.
//7.Imposition of a severe fine for damage caused by the discharge of industrial waste or sewage outside the authorised areas.
//8.Effective management of toxic waste water discharge.
//9.Utilization, to the maximum extent possible, of recycled water for agricultural purposes.
//10.Creation of an Independent Water Body.
21.11 Environmental Agency/Environmental Impact Studies
//The presence of environmental and ecological organisations is now a given and is an indispensable factor in the management of issues relating to development and the environment.
//We recommend: 1.Promoting the creation of an Independent Environmental Body that will have the ability to coordinate decision-making processes on an organized basis.
//The Independent Environmental Body will also enable environmental ecological organisations to actively participate in a positive and meaningful way in programmes and problem-solving processes.
//2.Detachment of the Department of Environment from the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment and its integration into the Independent Environmental Agency.
//3.Strengthening the state services dealing with the environment in terms of personnel and resources.
//The development of transparency procedures and a sense of independence among public officials, so that they can carry out their work unhindered.
//4.Establishment of substantial financial support for environmental and ecological organisations and the Federation of Ecological and Environmental Organisations of Cyprus, within the framework of an annual sponsorship and through specific action programmes.
21.12 Overconsumption
//The consumer as a recipient and as a generating factor in the creation of products and services has both rights and responsibilities.
//In order to improve the quality of life of every citizen consumer, it is necessary that the rates of consumption keep pace with the rates of regeneration of our environment and resources.
//It is necessary to adopt and put into practice the concept of sustainability, emphasising the concepts of waste avoidance, reuse and recycling.
//Every consumer should be able to choose products and services that are healthy and safe for themselves and the environment, in the short and long term, and for which they should be provided with the necessary information.
//Today's man, with the way he grows, prepares, preserves and packages food, endangers not only his health but also his very existence.
//At the same time, the way we consume food out of season and get carried away by advertising messages, results in overconsumption, wasting precious resources and creating huge amounts of waste, endangering our environment.
//Chemical substances used in all stages of production, processing and preservation of food often end up on the plate of the consumer, who is hardly aware of the effects they have on his/her health.Specifically, food, due to the way it is produced, can contain pesticide residues, heavy metals, radioactive residues, hormones, antibiotics and other toxic residues.
//Large amounts of "suspicious" chemical additives are used in their industrial processing.
//Finally, chemicals can be transferred from the packaging to the food.Many of these substances have been shown to be dangerous carcinogens or allergens and for most of them little research has been done on their safety for consumer health.
//The interactions between the various chemicals present in food that accumulate in the human body also remain unknown.
// The food industry has become one of the world's most powerful industries as a result of massive urbanisation and lifestyle change.
//Today there is a rapid increase in the consumption of processed foods compared to fresh, natural products.
//Due to processing, vital substances such as vitamins, trace elements and other nutritional factors, as well as fibre, are destroyed or removed.
//There is also an increased consumption of foods of animal origin (mainly meat), foods with high protein and fat content, as well as concentrated foods (e.g. sugar, white flour and their products).
//These bad eating habits and the low-quality processed foods that are stacked on the shelves of supermarkets are largely responsible for the degenerative diseases of modern civilization: obesity, tooth decay, arteriosclerosis, heart attacks, diabetes, cancer.
//The primary purpose of agriculture and food production is to provide consumers with healthy, high quality products.
