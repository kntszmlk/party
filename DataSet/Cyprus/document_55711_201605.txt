PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 2016 DEMOCRATIC ALARM
Friends,
On 22 May, Cypriot society will be asked to make a decisive choice: Whether the country will continue on the path towards recovery, tackling unemployment and other challenges of the real economy that offers a stable perspective for the country or whether it will return to the old practices and attitudes that caused the economic crisis and the deadlocks.We must continue on the same line that led us to exit from the Memorandum. Our fellow citizens have shown great maturity throughout the crisis. We all need to show patience to ensure the achievements that belong to Cypriot society as a whole. The sacrifices made by citizens must be put to good use. After all, what happened in the recent past is well known and these mistakes must not be repeated. A strong Democratic Rally in Parliament means a strong government in times of challenges, not only in the issues of the economy, but also in the effort to reunite our divided country.The exit of the country from the memorandum certainly does not imply a definitive exit from the crisis. On the other hand, we cannot, however, negate the sacrifices of our people and what it means for a country to come out of a memorandum. It means regaining credibility and national sovereignty. Today is a test of everyone's seriousness, responsibility and maturity. In the Democratic Rally, we choose the difficult path of responsibility rather than backtracking on the practices that led us to the edge of the cliff.
To change Cyprus, we must first change the mindset. We are determined to move forward and in this effort, we want the citizens to participate. Because abstention and detachment create space for negative phenomena such as the ones we are currently being asked to manage. Power in any form needs, and must feel, the constant scrutiny of citizens.Since the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, this three-year period has been the only period during which scandals of corruption and corruption have been brought to justice, whether they involve named individuals, politicians or other officials. This must be credited to the Government, but also to the independent institutions.Cypriot society no longer tolerates cover-ups. Most of the scandals that are being uncovered today happened five and ten years ago. We are taking a big, positive step in the right direction, which must continue until those who committed the biggest financial crimes are brought under the clutches of the law.   In the parliamentary elections it is not so much a question of whether the electorate will reward the Government and the Democratic Rally for preventing the worst and putting the Cypriot economy, with the sacrifices of all of us, back on the road to growth. Voters are called upon to send the message that Cyprus must not go back to the times of mismanagement, corruption and deadlock. We continue to pay the cost of past mistakes today, as the road remains difficult and uphill. Therefore, the sacrifices of citizens must not be wasted. Therefore, we must continue in the same line to ensure a stable perspective for the country.
CYPRUS
//The Cyprus problem is at the heart of the Democratic Rally's policy, as a problem of military invasion and occupation and human rights violations by Turkey in Cyprus.
//Our goal and vision is the liberation of Cyprus from military occupation and colonization,
// its reunification and the creation of conditions for the peaceful coexistence of Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Armenians, Maronites and Latins.
//The only option available for the resolution of the Cyprus problem was and remains the process of talks under the auspices of the United Nations, on the basis of the Bi-zonal Bicommunal Federation, as set out in the 1977 and 1979 Summit Agreements, the UN resolutions, the July 8, 2006 Agreement and as set out in the unanimous resolutions of the National Council of 1989 and 2009.
//The transformation of the Republic of Cyprus into a Federal Republic of Cyprus with one sovereignty, one international personality and one nationality
// and respect for human rights and the principles and values of the European Union are the basic preconditions for achieving a viable and sustainable solution to the Cyprus problem.
//The repeal of the Treaty of Guarantees
// and the restoration and safeguarding of the basic freedoms and rights of all legal residents of Cyprus, including the rights of free movement, establishment and property, must be enshrined in the settlement agreement.
//The policy of pragmatism and rational patriotism is the only one that can ensure the natural and national survival of Cypriot Hellenism in the land of its fathers.
//On the basis of these guidelines, President Anastasiades' efforts in the context of the ongoing intra-Cypriot talks are unreservedly based,
// to achieve with the synergy of the European and International Stakeholder
//and with the full support of Greece
//solution of the Cyprus problem, ensuring the functionality and viability of the Federal Republic of Cyprus, as the Republic of Cyprus will evolve.
//The settlement agreement of the Cyprus problem, which is sought to emerge from the negotiations, will only be valid if it is approved by referendums, both by the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot community.
ECONOMY
//Years ago we had a false prosperity while our country's image abroad was plummeting.
// On the one hand, as a state, we were spending much more than we had.
//On the other hand, our banking system has developed far beyond the borders and the country's capabilities.
//At the same time and in addition to these, the reluctance of the previous government to take the necessary decisions was added.
// We have experienced the denial of reality, ideological obsessions, indifference to the great challenges of the globalised economy and an attempt to hide the problems under the carpet and pass the bomb on to the next generation.
//In March 2013, the 15-day government of Nicos Anastasiades was called upon to make difficult, painful but necessary decisions.
// It is reasonable to complain that unprecedented measures have been applied in Cyprus in an attempt to send a message to the whole of Europe.
// But none of this would have happened if we had taken timely action.
//Nothing would have happened if we had listened when we demanded spending restraint and urgent action to address the problems.
//But the Cypriot people have once again risen to the occasion.
//He made hard sacrifices in anticipation of the reversal of what he suffered.
//Knowing how difficult the road was, the government of Nicos Anastasiades took the burden of responsibility on its shoulders.
//And despite the fact that we are a parliamentary minority government, we succeeded in the parliament to form the alliances that led to the passage of all the necessary bills.
//Exactly three years later, Cyprus came out of the memorandum.
//We have regained our dignity and our national sovereignty as a country.
//We became masters of our country again.
//It is widely accepted that the economic and fiscal recovery effort undertaken by Cyprus has yielded results far better than expected.
//And these results are due to a significant extent to the resilience shown by the Cypriot economy, especially in the services sectors.
//The collective effort brought Cyprus to record economic growth slightly below 2% in 2015, with positive prospects for 2016.
//In just two years, Cyprus has the highest growth rate in the last seven years.
//As a result, even the most skeptical observer can see that the Cypriot economy has not only stabilized, but is now on a growth track.
//Public finances have been tidied up without a single new tax being imposed, limiting a wasteful and inefficient state and the burden on the citizen.
//But the problems in the real economy are still there.
//The wounds have not yet healed.
// High unemployment and non-performing loans exist and require solutions.
// This is the challenge of the next day: to emerge from the crisis with a more modern and more effective state.
//Democratic Rally believes in the potential of the private sector.
//We know that sustainable growth will not come through increased government spending, but through private investment.
// We want our businesses to be active and profitable again.
//Because without winning, they cannot develop new sectors either,
//nor do they create jobs.
//We want to create a reliable environment to attract investment by fighting red tape,
//the provision of incentives and the full restoration of confidence in our country.
//Without trust and credibility, no foreigner will invest in our country.
//And without foreign investment there can be no rapid economic growth, prosperity and jobs.
//We know well that the results are not visible to all citizens yet.
//Alas, however, if we risk the sacrifices that citizens have made and laid a solid foundation for a better next day for our country.
//Also, if we confirm all those who fear that we will not manage on our own, without the Troika.
//We are determined to refute them.
//We will not risk the sacrifices of our people for temporary political gain.
//We will remain the permanent enemies of populism, reckless wishes and catchy slogans.
//We are building the best Cyprus and we are determined to succeed.
//Always in the front line, with responsibility, rationality and prudence.
REFORMS
//The main axis of the Democratic Rally's policy is reform at all levels.
//Our country is finally changing.
//Cyprus turns a page.
//We have proceeded with the huge reform of the Minimum Guaranteed Income by institutionalising the state's obligation to support every citizen and eliminating all forms of discrimination and inequality.
// At the same time, the number of public benefits has been rationalised and better targeted, so as to ensure a minimum guaranteed income for all those who really need it.
//We are moving forward in reforming the state for the citizen and the economy.
//We bring mobility to the wider public sector in order to achieve the optimal use of human resources.
//We link wage increases to the economic development of the country.
//We are changing the evaluation and the way the Public Service Commission operates.
//We are moving towards the implementation of e-government.
//We work to have quality education for our children.
//A new teacher recruitment process has been established, which will ensure that the most competent teachers are hired, rather than those who are older.
//We are still discussing the implementation of a new evaluation system for our teachers.
//A system that will link the evaluation of the school unit and teachers to the educational programmes and the results produced.
//We want to finally give the right to private school graduates to claim admission to the Public Universities of the country.
//We start health care reform with the patient at the centre and not the interests.
//We support the administrative and financial autonomy of state hospitals as a basic prerequisite for the transition to a General Health System.
//With a focus on the citizen, we are striving for reform in local government.
//We reduced the military service, modernizing our army, because we care about our young people with the aim of creating a flexible and effective semi-professional army with a 14-month service.
//We maintain the prospect of meritocratic advancement for all executives
//and we welcome the establishment of procedures that prevent any interference in the issues of placements, transfers, facilities in the National Guard, both for conscripts and permanent personnel.
//Modernising agricultural production.
//We promote the system of faster and better quality justice.
//We are completing the process of awarding the Limassol port activities to strategic investors, creating new, huge prospects for our country.
//We are working methodically and in full cooperation with Greece on the great energy opportunity that lies ahead of us.
// Building strong alliances across the region.
//And at the same time, we reduce the financial burden and the burden on the citizen, reducing a wasteful and inefficient state.
//Modernising semi-public organisations
//and we remove those who have completed their cycle.
//We are working on radical, game-changing reforms, knowing that the results are not yet visible to all citizens.
//But alas, if we risk all these sacrifices that we have made and have laid the solid foundation for a better next day for our country.
//We will not risk the sacrifices of this people for any temporary political gain.
//We are building the best Cyprus and we are determined to succeed.
//This is our mission today. To create a confident and hopeful country.
//An ambitious country that will take off without leaving anyone behind.
Position of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the Workshop entitled "The Reduction of Military Service" Wednesday, 16 March 2016, CNP Insurance Holdings Auditorium, 6.00pm
Friends, I would like to welcome you to today's debate.This is another Democratic Rally of the Democratic Rally aimed at the Cyprus of the next day.
//But today's event has something very special.
//Our issue today is one of those for which our people can feel proud of Cyprus.
//Optimism for the future of our country.
//We are here to discuss the radical reform of our country's defence capability.
// The restructuring of the National Guard, its equipment with modern means, the creation of a semi-professional army, the reduction of military service.
//One of the many issues that, while being discussed for decades, our state has been reluctant to take the initiative.
//One of the important changes that shield our country, upgrade it qualitatively and at the same time offer to society and the economy, both in the short term and in the long term.
//I want to congratulate the Minister of Defence and the government for managing to translate this great goal of Nicos Anastasiades' programme into action.
// Christoforos, with systematic work you have shown that Cyprus can become a better country, if we believe it and work hard to achieve it.
//I would like to thank the Vice Rector of the University of Cyprus for his presence here and his contribution to the discussion of the implications of this major reform.
//To him, however, I want to express my appreciation for the University's reflexes and flexibility to immediately create the structures to enable the soldiers who will be discharged next January to make beneficial use of the semester that will follow.
//The same goes for private universities, which I am sure will make sure to adjust their programs so that not a single day is lost for the National Guardsmen who will be fired.
//I would also like to thank the President of the Youth Organization Panagiotis Sentonas and the President of the Coordinating Committee of Students Mario Prokopiou, both for their presence and for the responsible work of the institutions they represent.
//I would also like to thank the representatives of private universities who were invited to participate in today's debate but unfortunately could not do so due to other commitments.
//Dear friends, I will not tire of repeating that Cyprus is a small country, but with unlimited potential.
// It is our geographical location and our European status.
//It is the remarkable ability of our people to have economic and other dealings with the outside world.
// It is our ability to negotiate and build alliances with our neighbours, whether they are Arabs or Jews.
//This country, in any case, needs a modern, reliable and flexible army to be able to respond to the great and ever-changing challenges of our turbulent region.
//Most importantly, however, is the need to have a credible deterrent force
//if, by all means, we have an upsurge of Turkish aggression.
//And I want to be clear about something.
//We are putting off an intense and systematic effort to resolve the Cyprus problem, which seems to have a serious chance of succeeding.
// We have a window of opportunity that is also created because of the international situation.
//For some, this should be a reason to leave the National Guard untouched, in its declining course.
//Some others are annoyed that we are investing again in the military's strength, in which nothing was invested from the time of the Clerides government until today.
//I agree with both approaches.
//A country with the European, energy and regional challenges of Cyprus cannot have a flexible and modern military force.
//And this strength and capacity, Cyprus should have it
//and after the honourable compromise on the Cyprus problem that we all want has been reached.
//Under other terms and conditions of course.
//Friends and Friends, In order to achieve the restructuring of the National Guard, very serious studies were required.
//Critical consultation and cooperation between the Ministries of Defence and Finance was required.
//And for this I would also like to thank the Minister of Finance for his positive contribution.
//Most importantly, it required the political decision and the will of the government and all of us, not to backtrack on the course of necessary changes that for so many years the political system either cowed or was unwilling to carry out.
//The reform and reorganization of the National Guard will make Cyprus a more reliable country.
//Our young people will have immediate benefits, since those already enlisted will be discharged in January after 18 months of service, while those who will enlist in July will be the first to serve 14 months.
//With the recruitment of 3,000 soldiers, we will be able to reduce unemployment.
// While the economy will be able to benefit in the medium term, if a whole generation will be able to throw itself into production and creation a year earlier.
//There are still some details pending. Such as whether the last conscripts to serve 24 months can have some form of more relaxed treatment in the latter stages of their service, so as not to feel a sense of injustice.
// What will happen to the few recruits of the 2015A ESSO.
//How conscripts who are already entitled to reduced service, such as children of large families or children who have lost parents, will be treated.
//The Minister is here and we hope to have answers.
// But whatever they are, it doesn't change the big picture.
//And the big picture is that right now, after all we have been through, our mission is one: To protect the sacrifices of our people and to build a better next day for our Cyprus.
//To finally give a stable perspective to our country.
// To return the smile and optimism to our people.
//We can do it!
//We want to achieve it!
//Reforms like this one in the army show the way.
//A road we are determined to go down!
Thank you!
Presentation by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the event entitled "The future of professional services and the financial sector in Cyprus" Wednesday, 10 February 2016, Administration Building, Hellenic Bank, Nicosia.
Dear speakers,
Friends,
//It is a great pleasure and honour to be with you tonight at the event co-organised by the Democratic Rally and the Young Scientists Organisation on "The future of professional services and the financial sector in Cyprus".
//Timely issue concerning a key sector of our economy.
//The timeless importance of professional services and the financial sector is even more highlighted today as Cyprus' exit to the markets and investor confidence mark the completion of the Cyprus programme in March.
//It is widely accepted that the economic and fiscal recovery effort undertaken by Cyprus has yielded results far better than expected.
//And these results are due to a significant extent to the resilience shown by the Cypriot economy, especially in the services sectors.
//Friends and Friends, The collective effort brought Cyprus to record an economic growth of slightly less than 2% in 2015 with positive prospects for 2016.
// In just two years Cyprus has the highest growth rate in the last 7 years.
//The resilience and professionalism shown by the services and financial sector, especially after the country was hit, with the broader financial sector at the centre, demonstrates their unparalleled importance to our economy.
//And further underlines the importance of the sector for the future, in a global environment with trends towards the development of innovations in the sector.
//Fintech start-ups, businesses in the emerging sector known as financial technology, for example, are changing the game and creating new perspectives globally.
// A trend that Goldman Sachs puts at $4. 7 trillion.
//Investment in the sector has tripled in one year to just over $12 billion, with Europe contributing 215% of this increase.
//Europe moving at the pace of the Digital Single Market with countries like the UK appointing special envoys for this purpose.
//Cyprus in the vital service and financial sectors has expertise, talented human resources and resilient, visionary businesses.
// Necessary ingredients to be able to take advantage of global and European trends and developments.
//Ladies and Friends, But to achieve economic growth, to provide a fertile environment for creation and prosperity,
// The important steps towards the total reform of the state must become even more tangible.
/ / / We must courageously move forward with radical reforms of mindsets and processes.
// To continue the policy of reform and change even when we are not under the memorandum process.
//Our aim is to simplify procedures, reform vital public services, such as the Registrar of Companies, particularly through e-government and smart government, and by making use of the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding with Estonia.
//Reform that will help upgrade the sector and serve our goal of making Cyprus more competitive.
//But who better to share the vision and legislative framework in these sectors, and to express their views on how to preserve and develop these sectors than the distinguished speakers at today's event.
Friends,
Dear guests,
//I look forward to your statements and the discussion that will follow and I wish the event every success.
Address by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at an Event against Discrimination "Discrimination Zero Hour "Monday 21 March, Leventis Gallery, Nicosia, 6.30 p.m.
Honourable Ministers,
Special guests,
Dear friends,
//It is a great pleasure to be here today at this event organized by the Democratic Rally, dedicated to the right of every human being to a life without discrimination.
//Today, being the "World Day Against Racism", gives us the opportunity to focus our attention on social issues: Claiming an equal place in society, ensuring dignity and respect, fighting discrimination and eliminating exclusion.
// Friends, All people are born equal and should have the same rights.
// Unfortunately, not everyone believes this.
//Some consider human life an object and classify it into categories.
//Discriminate and separate people according to their colour, gender, origin, profession.
//The phenomena of discrimination, social racism and xenophobia are based on prejudices and negative perceptions.
//Racism in its various forms is considered a violation of the fundamental human right to equality.
//This lack of respect and tolerance towards the "foreign" and the "different" is a characteristic element of our time and our society.
//A society of moral relaxation and crisis of values.
//Diversity is not a disadvantage. It is a characteristic.
// We cannot blame someone because they are a foreigner, because they are fat or ugly, because they are disabled or have different sexual preferences, or because they believe in a different God.
// Every human entity is unique and important.
// Dear all, Unfortunately, all forms of violence do not discriminate in terms of social status, educational level, income level, nationality and age.
//Many struggles may have been fought for human equality and undeniable victories won, but efforts for a fairer and more civilized world must be continuous.
//We must all of us, on an individual and collective level, try to fight racism.
// To enforce equality and strive to ensure that all people have equal opportunities.
// Government and society must actively and effectively tackle discrimination
// and to ensure that justice is done on the basis of human rights.
//The emphasis should be on educating young people with tolerance and acceptance as the main pillars of education.
//Humanism should be cultivated and democratic consciousness should be nurtured.
/ / But for us this is not enough. We must hold fast to our commitment to the principle of abolishing all forms of discrimination wherever it comes from.
// We owe respect for the laws and international treaties and, above all, for human dignity.
// We must remain committed to respecting the human rights of all persons regardless of their origin, religion or sexual behaviour.
//Supporting every initiative that promotes and fosters a society where human values are the foundation of a modern civilized society, we have the power to escape from the fear of the diversity of our neighbors.
// Diversity, instead of being a source of conflict, can lead to the creation of a spirit of broad understanding and respect.
//We are moving forward dynamically, developing structured actions and institutionalizing state obligations to support every citizen and eliminate all forms of discrimination and inequality.
//Equality and respect for difference can create a world that is just and institutionalised with democratic values, but above all civilised.
//Friends and friends, The message of today is respect for the diversity of each of us,
// equal participation in social life
//and the fundamental right to equal opportunities, equality and equity.
//We are not all the same, but we are all equal.
Speech by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the presentation of the candidates of the party "We are the Stable Perspective of the country" Sunday, 10 April 2016, International Fair
//Friends and Friends, Today we are entering the final stretch of the parliamentary elections.
//We present to the Cypriot people a ballot paper of quality and perspective.
//From candidates ready and determined to contribute to the upgrading and progress of our country. //I
would like to thank each and every one of our candidates.
//I feel confident in them.
//The Democratic Rally's ballot paper consists of men and women from the whole spectrum of society.
//Worthy fellow citizens who can take the country forward.
//To be the stable perspective for Cyprus.
//And we all know the difficult task ahead of us until May 22nd.
//Dear friends, I want to address today separately our candidates, the Synergy world, but also the whole Cypriot society.
//First of all, to the 55 chosen competitors who together we will fight the battle of the parliamentary elections from the front line.
//I want them to have it deeply engraved in their consciousness that the Democratic Rally is a vibrant and pioneering political party.
//We are the party that not only allows, but seeks political trend and differentiated opinion;
//But we are also the political force with clear positions on the Cyprus problem, the economy and reforms.
//Woe betide us if, in the course of the elections, we get carried away by populism;
//Woe betide us if, in our attempt to win the positive word of a few people for the sake of a few votes, we jeopardise the enormous sacrifices that these people have made in recent years.
//Woe betide us if we single-handedly undermine the titanic work of this government and this party.
//It is the need for this country to stay on the right track.
//We are addressing the citizens with candour.
//We are not going into this election with hidden agendas.
//We are fighting this battle with crystal clear positions.
//We are fighting this battle with confidence and certainty.
//With faith in the work that the government of Nicos Anastasiades and this party has brought to this country.
//But also with confidence in the perspective that we are reopening for our Cyprus.
//Friends and Friends, Members, Voters, Friends of the Democratic Rally,
//We are here today to renew our mission.
//We should go to the parliamentary elections even more modern, even stronger, even more credible.
//I stand before you with feelings of gratitude for your contribution to what we have achieved over the years.
//We have always been the party that took on the tough stuff.
//We were never afraid of the enormous challenges that our country had to face.
//We achieved national reconciliation after the national catastrophe of 1974 with Glafkos Clerides.
//We have achieved the accession of Cyprus to Europe, the greatest victory ever achieved by the Republic of Cyprus.
//A huge success that we owe again to our historic leader, Glafkos Clerides.
//Today, with Nicos Anastasiades, we are achieving the salvation and the rebirth of our country.
//We are achieving the reversal of the dramatic facts that the left government and its policies had created.
//Friends and friends, I have always been open to all of you.
// I don't want to or am not going to hide today either.
//I am well aware that in our efforts in recent days to faithfully implement our statutory provisions, false images have been created.
// Which, together with the unfortunate and unnecessary introversion, annoyed and bittered the proud Coalition world.
// I recognize the bad image that has been given.
//This bracket, however, closes for good today.
//The only thing we keep is the attitude of responsibility, altruism and personal transcendence shown by our colleague and friend Christos Pallis. This is the true Synergistic ethos.
//Friends and Friends, From today until May 22, we have to defend our policies and ideas.
//The stable perspective of this country.
//We have to defend the responsible and serious management that was done to save Cyprus from bankruptcy.
//Which led to the recovery of our dignity and national sovereignty.
//Because, yes! Cyprus is once again sovereign and reliable.
//Proud and equal!Thanks to the responsible leadership of Nicos Anastasiades.
//Thanks to our efforts, we were achieving the necessary majorities in Parliament.
//Majorities needed for Cyprus to go through the pitfalls of the Memorandum.
//Cyprus is becoming more reliable today than ever before. Both economically, nationally and regionally, but also on a European level.
//Our small country has become an example of a modern feat!
//It is this feat, as a result of the sacrifices of our people, that we are called upon to defend and protect in the elections.
//This is a course we will not risk.
//As well as the course of economic recovery.
//Friends and friends, We see again the same forces that brought us disaster, defending the same magical solutions of yesterday.
//Those who sent 70,000 of our fellow citizens into unemployment blame us for the fact that under our watch unemployment is decreasing.
//Those who pushed thousands of families to the social grocery stores dare to blame us because today this number has been drastically reduced.
//Those who cut wages and pensions blame us because we have not yet had time to restore the losses they caused.
//Those whose policies have led thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises to close and destroyed the middle class are now asking for the change.
//They are the ones who wanted Cyprus isolated.
// They are the ones who proposed the reintroduction of the pound.
//But the rest. Those who warned us about the tax storm that would follow the Memorandum.
//All those who, instead of recognizing what the whole world admits, are reminiscing about the sinful past.
//And they blame us for not bringing it back.
//They are the same people who, this time last year, pointed out to us the need to follow policies that were attempted in Greece.
//They asked us to tear up the memorandum. And when the tearing up of the memorandum in Greece brought a third and worse one, they were silent.
//They are the ones who brought us the Troika.
//And now that we've kicked her out, they're doing everything they can to bring her back.
//We will not allow them.
//Now that the sacrifices of our people have begun to bear fruit,
// we will not let them destroy them.
//We will not let Cyprus slide back into disaster!
//We will remain the force of responsibility.
//And that, my friends, is the stakes of this election. Whether Cyprus will continue on the path of responsibility and stable prospects, or whether it will turn back.
//Back to policies that do not account for public money.
//And they waste it at the expense of every citizen and every next generation.
//This is the dilemma facing every thinking citizen of this country.
//Friends and Friends, Unfortunately, many of our fellow citizens who share the same views as ours, are today in favour of abstention instead of defending this policy.
//They are our fellow citizens, victims of previous policies.
//Citizens frustrated by small and minor issues that have occurred.
//But also many young people, who - rightly to a large extent - choose this way to protest because the policies of the past have sent them into unemployment.
//I want to address these people, but also the entire Cypriot society.
//We have paid in this country in the worst way for wrong political choices.
//Not all parties are the same.
//Every vote has a direct impact on our lives and the course of our country.
//In the upcoming crucial elections, the Cypriot people are called upon to choose.
//And before him he has two choices. The path of a stable perspective. And the other that takes us backwards.
//And it is on the vote of the people that the stable course will depend.
//Woe betide us if we let the children take Cyprus back!
//The abstention is turning us back.
//Dear friends, we know that we have not reached the end.
//There are still major problems.
//But we are on the right track.
//We have consolidated public finances.
//We have stabilized the banking system.
//People are returning to work.
//Businesses are being born again.
//We are making changes and reforms everywhere. //We are making
changes that will make life better for every citizen.
//We are attracting foreign investment that revitalizes economic activity and brings growth.
//We are building alliances everywhere that finally take advantage of our country's geographical position.
//We have regained the hope and the prospect of a proper solution to our national problem,
//which will finally unleash the great potential of our country.
//These are the great things!
//These are what we are fighting for!
//These are what we must defend!
//For the stable prospects of our country!
//Ladies and friends, In a few weeks we have parliamentary elections.
//Our goal is one and only and clear: A strong Democratic Rally for an even stronger government.
//To strengthen political stability.
//To put the troubled era that some have led us into behind us for good.
//Now is the time to take another leap forward.
//To take the lead in a new course for our country.
//We have much more to do! In the economy. On the national issue. In the reforms.
//We are present at the appointment of history, to pull the country forward. //To
give solutions to the problems.
//To build the best Cyprus.
//A Cyprus of high expectations. //A Cyprus
that creates. //A
Cyprus with a strong economy. //A Cyprus
that produces decent jobs.
//A Cyprus with a regional role and geopolitical importance.
//A country that is ambitious and will take off, leaving no one behind.
//This is our goal. To help each of our fellow citizens to realize their own dreams.
//This is the Democratic Rally. Let's move forward together!
//Come together to make the vision come true.
//The vision of a free, united, and proud homeland!
//We are the stable perspective of this country!
//Together, we will take Cyprus forward!
Presentation of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the discussion with students at the University of Cyprus "Connecting Universities to the market" Friday 4 March 2016, 11.00 am - University of Cyprus, Nicosia
//Friends and friends, It is with great pleasure that I am among you at this original event that directly concerns your future.
//Dear students, you are the future of our country and it is our obligation to formulate structures and create tools that will give you the necessary skills to conquer the future and make your dreams come true.
//Our proposal concerns the broader Interconnection of Universities with the Market, the standards applied in other countries that constitute good and effective practices.
Career Fair or Career and Entrepreneurship Fair
//We encourage our universities to create their own network with businesses, which they make available to students in the final year;
//This way the first contact with the labour market will be made by organizing a Career and Entrepreneurship Fair;
//By opening the process to the business world, which will offer jobs to students who have the necessary qualifications from the undergraduate level.
Signing a contract with undergraduate students
//To go forward, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.
//We may well learn lessons from good practices of universities in other countries.
//We offer employment and contract signing to undergraduate students, based on specific criteria, such as field of study, academic performance, skills, and through specific procedures such as interviews, psychometric tests, etc., to be agreed with the employer.
//This will be another incentive for you students to achieve academic excellence and enhance your professional profile,
// while for businesses it will be an opportunity to strengthen their human resources with qualified executives who have the potential for advancement.
// At the same time it is a way for our Universities to upgrade their degrees in the market.
//More specifically, the Career and Liaison Offices need to be strengthened to carry out this task.
//In addition, their tasks include preparing students for personal development and labour market integration, networking and contacts with businesses through presentations, exhibitions, competitions, company visits, market integration either for internships or full-time employment.
//Empowerment should be both at the level of infrastructure such as effective data management systems, financial support for the implementation of actions, but also training where necessary, and adequate staffing.
Offer preparation and training courses
//We recommend the inclusion of courses for strengthening students' competences in specific areas, which are expected to strengthen the profile of young people in order to make them more easily absorbed by the market.
Specifically, we propose courses related to strengthening students' competences in research and innovation,
//as well as youth entrepreneurship and its promotion, in the curricula of degrees in specific areas.
Compulsory experience courses
//In the context of the undergraduate curricula, we recommend the extension of the institution of internships in as many fields of study as possible, both in local companies and in foreign companies.
//Specifically, the methodology must be extended to 2 areas: Firstly, as regards internships in local enterprises: we recommend the integration of internships in the curricula
// and support the programmes by paying a fee to the student and the company that will accept him/her.
//In addition, the creation of a specific institutional framework is required in order to restrict the employer from exploiting the student for a long period of time without any allowance, as well as to oblige him/her to determine the content of the internship.
//Secondly, regarding internships in foreign companies, we suggest that this be done through Erasmus placement, or the IESTE programme, with the help and contribution of the Labour Department (EURES) to help students find internships abroad.
Audit and redesign of practice in the professional licensing sectors
//We consider it necessary to redesign and better supervise those sectors that, in order to be registered in the professional registers and to obtain the right to exercise the profession fully, require a previous training of a few months;
//This training should be able to start from the undergraduate level and be completed with the acquisition of the degree.
//It is not possible to keep young graduates out of the labour market for a period of about a year or so, or to exploit them, as has often been observed;
// Moreover, universities, wishing to boost the absorption of their own graduates into the labour market, should develop their capacity to place their students in their respective companies.
Accelerating the ability of universities to exploit marketable ideas
//For us it is imperative to create the appropriate institutional and legal framework, so that ideas that can be generated either by you, the students or by academics, in academic institutions, can receive the necessary support to turn ideas into companies.
//In this way the country enjoys added value and a return on its investment in research and innovation.
//Our proposal for a broader linking of Universities with the market aims to support and equip you to conquer the future and make your dreams come true.
//It is not just a prospect with the potential to place Cyprus in the high-tech countries.
//It is the duty of the state to give you the tools, but also the opportunities to use them, so that our country can become innovative, competitive and innovative with growth in sectors with high added value.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Presentation of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr.Averof Neophytou at the event entitled "Paphos 2017 - Workshop on Culture and Tourism" Tuesday, 29 March 2016, Athena Beach Hotel, Paphos, 5.00pm
Honourable Ministers,
Honourable former EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth
Dear friends,
Special guests,
//I would like to thank you for your presence today at the Workshop we are organizing on Culture and Tourism.
//Tourism has always been one of the most important industries in our country;
//Our small country attracts millions of tourists every year who come to enjoy its incomparable natural beauties, for the most part;
//Friends and Friends, as I said in the workshop we organized on tourism, as far as the country's tourism policy is concerned, we have largely focused on a sun and sea model for decades.
//But all the neighbouring Mediterranean countries have sun and sea, and the Cypriot tourism product is less competitive than others in the wider region, burdened by higher costs.
//Dear Friends, The proliferation of new technologies and new media offers new possibilities and opportunities in the development of tourism activities and power in the hands of the tourist to choose, and to be informed.
//Current trends in the international tourism environment and the intense competitive conditions require renewal and diversification of the tourism product,
//orientation of the destination in the international market,
//exploitation of opportunities and specific targeting of promotional actions.
//In such an environment, Cyprus, in order to be able to compete, will undoubtedly have to upgrade and enrich its tourism product;
//Differentiate it;
//Ensure the quality of the services provided;
//It is necessary to promote other advantages of our country, apart from the sun and the sea;
//Culture is a comparative advantage of our country that we have left largely unexploited.
// Beautiful Cyprus with its rich culture has all the guarantees and ingredients that can differentiate its tourism product and add value.
// Cyprus' culture is a unique identity that can add value to the tourism product.
//To achieve this, we must develop and allow synergies to develop that will give our tourism product comparative advantages.
//Dear Sir, the role of the CTO in the new setting must also be changed by transforming and upgrading it into a sub-ministry of tourism and focusing on the promotion of our tourism product.
//The reform of the role of the CTO in the new setting must include coordination and consultation with both the Cultural Services of the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Department of Antiquities in the Ministry of Transport as well as with the relevant Ministry of Energy, Trade, Industry and Tourism.
//The management of tourism in the new data must not remain in a bureaucratic organization nor in monolithic and vertical policies;
/// Horizontal policies are required to the structures for upgrading the tourism product with the spearhead of the comparative advantages of our country such as culture.
//The targeted promotion of the country's comparative advantages as a tourist destination, through multiple and appropriate channels, calls for modern concepts and attitudes.
//The need to modernise the CTO is imperative in order for it to be able to achieve its objective, which is none other than the promotion of Cyprus as a tourist destination.
//Dear friends, Pafos Cultural Capital 2017 inextricably links tourism with culture.
//Pafos has been a cradle of culture since ancient times as the most culturally rich area of Cyprus.
//A culture that it did not choose to highlight and instead spent half a million euros every year on organizing various Operas.
//It could very well organize for example the "Aphrodite Festival" and highlight the culture of Paphos and Cyprus,
//The fact that Paphos will be the European Capital of Culture in 2017, can be the opportunity and the trigger for Paphos as a cultural "spearhead" for this new positioning of our tourist product. //It
will certainly contribute to this if some of the projects of Pafos 2017 are permanent infrastructure projects that contribute to the promotion of the cultural face of Cyprus.
//With smart policies and incentives, the tourist face of Cyprus and the differentiation of our tourist product in quality and with a focus on culture can bring multiple benefits, such as the extension of the tourist season, attracting higher quality tourism.
//The impact of the title of European Capital of Culture will be seen through the increase in tourism thanks to the improvement of infrastructure and the development of the city,
// but also through the increase in local income from tourism-related sectors.
//European Capitals of Culture are popular destinations and the variety and quality of their cultural programme acts as a catalyst for cultural tourism.
//Pafos has a great cultural heritage and many attractions to showcase.
//Including the ruins of the temple of Aphrodite, castles, theatres, fortresses, tombs and the famous mosaics of the Roman period, which are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
//The first capital of Cyprus during the Hellenistic and Roman era, Paphos is once again the capital, only this time with the official title of European Capital of Culture.
//Friends and Friends, Tourism has always been an important part of our economy and can become even more important.
//The competitiveness of our tourism product is a national affair and closely linked to the prosperity of the country and the real economy.
//It is another area where we need to move forward with radical reform;
//Revise the regulatory framework and courageously reorganise and abolish unnecessary and bureaucratic procedures;
//Differentiate our tourism product strategically to add value.
To build a better and more competitive Cyprus.
//In this effort no one is left out. Local authorities and the private sector tourism industry have a role to play.
//Friends and Friends, I look forward to your comments and the discussion that will follow and I wish the event every success.
Thank you. Bless you.
Address by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the event of the DISY Secretariat for Intercommunal Cooperation "Cyprus: Prospects and Problems of the Economy "17 March 2016, Journalist's House, 7.00 p.m.
//Dear friends, distinguished guests, It is with great pleasure that I am attending tonight's event of the Democratic Rally's Secretariat for Intercommunal Cooperation, entitled "Cyprus: Prospects and Challenges of the Economy".
//An admittedly topical issue, as we are going through a promising period, but also a period full of challenges, as far as the prospects of reaching a permanent and viable solution to the Cyprus problem are concerned.
//The challenges will not stop on that blessed day when the two communities approve an agreed solution.
//Without exaggeration, we can say that on that day they will start!
//The solution should work.
//And may the United Republic of Cyprus do justice to the visions and hopes of our people for a better tomorrow.
//From time to time we follow or participate in various discussions on the economic data of a possible solution.
// With some claiming that a possible solution will bring economic disaster and others that the next day it will rain money.
//If anything has changed in this new effort, it is the realization that economic data is important for the successful implementation of a potential solution.
//We express our satisfaction because this is also perceived by the international community.
//We are very positive that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are taking responsibility for studying this parameter.
//It is therefore important that we all work together to ensure that the solution meets the concerns of both communities.
//Creating benefits for all,
//be functional and economically viable
// and lay the foundations for significant economic growth.
//This is what we are trying to achieve.
//This implies that the economic parameters of the Solution must be considered and decided during the negotiation process.
//With all due respect to those who say that we must first get to the solution and then look at the economics of it, I believe that this approach is wrong.
//We should also look at the economic data at the same time so that we know that a potential solution is feasible to implement.
//This is a basic programming rule.
//The economic challenges of a possible solution could be grouped into three main pillars: First: The money that will be required to settle the property.
// That is, compensation for those properties that will not be returned to the rightful owners, within the criteria to be agreed.
//The Planning Bureau estimated in 2004 that 65% of the cost of a possible solution would be related to compensation for Greek Cypriot property in the TC component state.
//But today the facts have changed.
// It is currently already agreed that property owners will have a choice between restitution, partial restitution, monetary compensation, exchange and compensation in real property in the constituent state in which they wish to live.
//As a result, the financial resources required for compensation will be significantly lower as many displaced owners will be able to choose the form of compensation required.
//Turkey will undoubtedly have to assume its financial responsibilities in this matter.
//As well as the international community should contribute generously.
//However, we are under no illusions. We do not believe that they will give us tens of billions of euros to solve the property issue.
// But we need to further reduce the cost of cash compensation through the options I mentioned earlier and through the agreement on territorial adjustments.
//This can be achieved through the interconnection of the property and the territory.
//This is the position of the Democratic Rally, this is also the position of the President of the Republic, whom we support.
//The return of as many refugees and properties under Greek administration as possible will, by definition, reduce the cost of reparations.
//It has been estimated that land revaluations that would allow 50% of the displaced to return to their homes under the Yekaterinburg administration, would correspond to 25 billion euros worth of property to be returned to the rightful owners.
//Reducing the cost of compensation accordingly.
// Hence the President of the Republic's effort to return as much high-value property as possible under the Greek administration.
//Tuition, the remaining properties which will be subject to the partial or full compensation treatment will be of a much lower total value than those returned under Yekaterinburg administration.
//Second. The cost of creating infrastructure and necessary development projects in the areas under territorial readjustment.
// Here you will allow me to express a different, perhaps different, view from the prevailing one.
//Investment in infrastructure will ensure economic growth throughout Cyprus
//and will create thousands of jobs across the economy.
//Both communities will benefit and at the same time the living standards of thousands of displaced people will be raised.
//Where others see costs, we see opportunities and investments.
//The reconstruction of Famagusta is not a cost.
//The extension of roads is not a barium.
// Nor the creation of sewage, water and irrigation systems and the reconstruction of dilapidated houses.
//It is a development agency that, through a proper investment framework, can create wealth and prospects.
// The European Union has a number of development funds that we can and should use for this purpose.
//Third The running costs and the structure of the federal state and the constituent states.
//I want to be clear on this point. We have not rescued our country from an economic disaster, with the sacrifices of our people, only to bring back the Troika in a few years.
//And let not my reference be taken as negative for finding a solution.
//We are consciously committed to the struggle for the reunification of our homeland.
//This is only possible if the solution is viable and workable.
//And it must also be economically viable.
//The integration of two separate economic models, whether it concerns government spending and social benefits, or the banking and services sectors, should be done in a way that sets common fiscal targets and strong supervision.
//So that one state does not become a weight on the other, or on the federal structure, but together they create prospects for development.
//Moreover, a serious and fiscally stable United Cyprus will be able to take full advantage of the benefits of reunification and attract serious institutional investors.
//At the same time, an economic balance must be found in the economic sustainability of the solution, with priority given to the implementation of the agreement so that all federal structures are in place and all provisions of the agreement can be implemented smoothly.
//Dear friends, I will not go into the economics of the solution, because I am sure that our distinguished guests will do so adequately.
//Tonight I want to send a message to all Cypriots, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, that the maintenance of the current status quo is not sustainable; that it holds many risks for their future.
//Time is a luxury that neither community has.
//After 4 decades of separation, most refugees no longer have any memories or experiences of our common life together.
// In a few years most of those who have experienced it will either no longer be with us or will be seniors.
//At the same time, of course, we should stress that no one is willing to sacrifice the quality of the solution for the sake of time.
// The solution should be functional, stand the test of time and make sense to future generations.
//One of the strengths of the new process is the agreement of the two leaders that only an agreed solution can be put to a referendum.
//Today there is a great need for a pillar of stability in the region.
// Cyprus can become this reliable pillar of political, economic and energy stability and cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean.
//A reunited Cyprus can play this role and more importantly, it can be the link between the European Union and the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.
//It can also be a successful model and example of a prosperous, multicultural society.
// A place where diversity and different religions are an incentive for better mutual understanding and cooperation and not a source of conflict and unhappiness.
//Dear friends, In conclusion, allow me to thank the distinguished guests and congratulate the members and the Secretary of the Secretariat for Intercommunal Cooperation for the topic of today's debate.
//Let us hope that very soon, a united and economically prosperous Cyprus will become a tangible reality for all its inhabitants.
Position of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the conference entitled "Digital Cyprus 2020: opportunities, challenges and reforms" Wednesday, 27 April 2016, Hilton Park Hotel, Nicosia, 11:00am
Dear speakers,
Friends,
//It is a great pleasure to welcome you to today's conference on the topical issue of "Digital Cyprus 2020: opportunities, challenges and reforms".
//The digital age is here and has become an integral part of our everyday life.
//New horizons are opening up with the digital integration of the European Union through the Digital Single Market.
// The real more Europe.
//A promising and challenging area of progress that could generate €415 billion in efficiency gains for Europe.
//An area of progress that creates new opportunities to stimulate the economy through e-commerce and facilitates administrative and financial compliance for businesses
//empowering citizens through e-government.
// Friends,The Digital Single Market is a flagship initiative of the European Union that extends the concept of the common market,
//and contribute to an ever closer union of the European peoples.
//It aims to eliminate trade barriers between Member States in order to increase economic prosperity.
//Improved access to information will bring benefits in reducing transaction costs and establish improved business management standards and innovative business models.
//The growth of e-commerce will bring tangible benefits for consumers, such as new products, lower prices and improved quality of goods and services, thanks to cross-border trade and easier comparison of offers.
//Enhancing e-government facilitates online compliance and access to jobs and business opportunities, for both citizens and businesses.
//In these developments, Cyprus, both as a member state of the European Union and as an island economy, cannot be left out.
/ / / It is imperative that we embrace the digital transformation of Cyprus as a factor in strengthening the competitiveness of the economy and as a driver of growth.
//Digital transformation builds the bridge that essentially connects our island with the rest of Europe and annihilates any distances.
//Friends and Friends, I often refer to the best Cyprus creates with the knowledge and talent of its human resources.
// This is the best of Cyprus that is often hidden behind the daily grumbling and the word of misery.
//I believe in this better Cyprus because Cyprus has potential and has proven it.
//And we envision the Cyprus of entrepreneurship, of creation, of perspective.
//Today's eighteen-year-olds don't know life without the internet; they know a world unified digitally.
// They are informed, entertained and many are active online.
//They literally "play" technology at their fingertips and acquire skills that will be with them for life.
//Digital entrepreneurship knows no borders.
//Friends and Friends, the challenge of the next day is to emerge from the crisis with a more modern and more effective state, a supporter of Cypriot entrepreneurship.
//The big challenge before us today is to build a better Cyprus. The digital Cyprus of entrepreneurship, competitiveness and growth.
//This is the great challenge: to remain steady on the path towards a better Cyprus, away from the sirens of populism.
//Cyprus has specialisation, talented human resources and visionary businesses - essential ingredients to be able to take advantage of global trends and developments.
//At the same time, the development of research and innovation can be a pillar for attracting foreign investment in innovation sectors, which has the potential and can become an important arm of our economy.
//They represent a perspective that has the potential to place Cyprus among the high-tech countries
//To achieve economic growth, however, in order to provide a fertile environment for creation, the important steps towards the total reform of the state must become even more tangible.
//We are moving forward in reforming the state for the citizen and the economy.
//We are moving towards the implementation of e-government which will reduce the administrative burden of private sector transactions with the public sector.
/ / / We must courageously move forward with radical reforms of mindsets and processes.
//Continue the policy of reform and change even now that we are not under a memorandum.
//Friends and Friends,
Dear guests,
I look forward to your contributions and the debate that will follow and I wish the event every success.
Thank you.
Bless you.
Presentation by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr.
Averof Neophytou at the event entitled "The contemporary challenges of Education in Cyprus" Friday, 18 March 2016, "Filoxenia" Conference Hall, Jean Monnet Room, Nicosia, 5.00pm
//Dear Minister of Education, Dear friends, Distinguished guests, I would like to thank you for your presence today at the conference we are organizing on Education and Education.
//If we all agree that young people are the future of this country, then surely we can also agree that the education provided will determine the quality of that future for future generations.
//Before setting out our vision of the education our children deserve, let me share with you a recent experience.
//A few days ago I had the opportunity to visit the Apostolos Loukas High School in Kolossi.
// It was here that the attention of people of art and culture from all over Europe was drawn.
//Congratulations to the great success of our students who participated in the art competition of the Saatchi Gallery in London, where their work "Immigrants" secured the first prize among 22.000 entries from all over Europe.
//So there I met children full of sensitivity.
//But also the conviction to transmit these sensitivities to the whole world through art and artistic creation.
//I talked to children who are concerned about what is happening around them.
//Who are interested in the drama and suffering of their fellow human beings.
//Who have the will and perseverance to compete and succeed.
//I also met teachers who care and stand by the children.
//Helping them to explore and develop their talents, acquire new skills and knowledge.
//Standing next to and not across from the students.
//This is the Education we dream of for our children, of creation and success.
//Friends and Friends, the first and most decisive step to solve a problem is to acknowledge its existence.And it is a fact that in our country, the Education Sector has been facing serious problems for many years.
//Problems that those in power - all of us - either didn't see, or pretended not to see.
//To avoid taking responsibility on hot issues.
// And the possible confrontation with various interest groups.
//Cyprus is the first among the EU member-states in terms of the amount of public spending on education. Unfortunately, the results of this spending are not as expected.
//This is confirmed both by the results of international assessments and by the performance of our students within our own educational system.
//We - all of us - have been hiding behind the imaginative institution of recourse over time, in order not to admit the problem.
//That year after year our students have more and more weaknesses. In basic subjects like Modern Greek, Math, Science.
//We see our graduates unable to enter the labour market in their field of study.
//This was the case before the crisis. Because our education system, whether in secondary or higher education, has for years been alienated from the changing needs of society and the labour market.
//We must acknowledge that for many decades we have not had the courage to make the necessary cuts that we need.
// It took us almost three decades to reach an agreement on defining a new teacher recruitment process. One that would ensure that the most competent, not the oldest, are hired.
//A change that we in the Democratic Rally wanted to see implemented as soon as possible.
//To have the most competent teachers in the classroom.
//Unfortunately, various interest groups and petty partisan considerations watered down this essential reform, since the intervention of the parliament postponed its full implementation until 2027.
//It took us two decades to realize that at a time when specialization is necessary, we were going in the opposite direction.
//Giving general and vague knowledge to our students, through the unlimited choices given by the National High School.
//We are still discussing the implementation of a new evaluation system for our teachers.
//A system that will link the evaluation of the school unit and teachers to the educational programmes and the results produced.
//We are particularly pleased because this government and this particular Minister of Education are not trying to hide the problems under the carpet.
//They are determined to move forward - and we are moving forward - with the reforms and the necessary changes that our Education is so much in need of.
//For us, it is our conviction that Education is the key of every society to exit from economic, social and institutional deadlocks.
//Investing in Education is literally investing in tomorrow.
//For it is the skills we equip our children with today that will determine the level of innovation, growth and competitiveness we will experience in the coming decades.
//Every effort to change mindsets and reform is bound to be accompanied by reactions.
//We declare unreservedly that we will support this effort, regardless of the political cost.
//To finally create an education system that focuses on students and the needs of our society.
//And we still have a lot to do.
//We are confident that through better management of existing resources, investment in research, the development of "entrepreneurship" among our young people, we can hope for better days.
//The autonomy of the school unit, the promotion of academic excellence, participation in innovative European programmes and proper professional orientation can give the impetus that our society needs today.
//We would be remiss if we did not reiterate our firm position. That the State should treat both public and private education equally.
//Offer equal opportunities and chances for all children, whether they attend public school or not
// go to private school.
//Today, about 18% of students attend private education.
//Parents who choose private school for their children, in addition to the taxes they pay, essentially relieve the state of a large cost.
//We welcome the submission of a specific proposal by the government that finally gives the right to private school graduates to claim admission to the Public Universities of the country.
//Without affecting any position currently offered to public school students.
//We call on all political forces to support this proposal.
//For many years we have been praying as the Democratic Rally for this positive development.
//Permit me, however, to express the view that we cannot make the leap forward with half-measures.
//We want our universities to become competitive, which is why we believe that the admission of students to our universities should not be done in a flattening way.
//Each university should have its own selection criteria.
//Criteria that will promote academic excellence
//and that will treat all students equally.
//OkEL's friends tell us that they will not allow the University of Cyprus to become the Oxford of Cyprus.
//We reply that we will not allow them to turn the University of Cyprus into the Lumumba of Cyprus.
// Because selecting the best according to objective criteria is called investing in the future and academic excellence, not elitism.
// It is the opposite that cements mediocrity and flattening.
//Dear friends, In a semi-inhabited country like our country, Education has a special role to play.
//Through our educational system we must keep the memory and the desire for reunification and the liberation of our country from partition and occupation unquenched.
//At the same time, we must work to create a culture of peaceful coexistence and creative cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
//We want to listen to the concerns and problems that exist.
// But also to seize the great opportunities and possibilities offered through their resolution, to build a robust Tomorrow.
//Far from slogans, petty political or trade union agendas, we are committed to being beneficial and productive.
//We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our children.
Statement of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the Workshop on Labour Issues entitled "Employment at the heart of Cyprus' development trajectory" Friday, 15 April 2016, Cultural Centre, European University, 4.30pm
Honourable Minister of Labour,
Dear representatives of business and workers,
Dear friends,
It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to today's workshop on "Employment at the heart of Cyprus' Growth Trajectory".
//At a time when we have set the strengthening of employment and the reduction of unemployment as a top priority, tonight's debate could not be more timely.
//Permit me to begin my remarks by recalling the old saying our grandparents used to say: that work is a blessing.
//And indeed, we Cypriots have been blessed for many years, with a near-zero unemployment rate.
//We quickly overcame the economic disaster caused by the Turkish invasion
//and together, workers and entrepreneurs alike, we achieved an economic miracle, achieving unprecedented growth rates for years.
//During the same period, the Cypriot economy moved from the primary sector to the construction sector, tourism and professional services.
//Unfortunately, however, we fell back on what we had achieved.
//We did not understand that in a modern and ever-changing globalised economy you have to constantly modernise to remain competitive.
//The management model we have applied has remained attached to state protectionism.
//No to serving the citizen and creating a modern and attractive investment environment.
//And I make it clear that the workers are obviously not responsible for this.
// First and foremost, we politicians are responsible. Who, in order not to lose a few votes, were reluctant to proceed with any reform that might contain a political cost.
//An already problematic economic model has been compounded by the pressure of the global financial crisis.
//The unwillingness of the previous government to take necessary decisions
// and the continuation of an unsustainable economic policy has led to an increase in problems.
//We have witnessed the denial of reality, ideological obsessions, indifference to the great challenges of the globalised economy and an attempt to hide problems under the carpet.
//We continued to spend as a state much more than we had.
//We were unconcerned about taking necessary decisions and continued to maintain an artificial prosperity, while the country's image abroad was plummeting.
//At the same time, the banking system had developed far beyond the country's borders and its capabilities.
//In March 2013, the 15-day government of Nicos Anastasiades was called upon to make difficult, painful but necessary decisions.
// It is reasonable to complain that unprecedented measures have been applied in Cyprus in an attempt to send a message to the whole of Europe.
//But none of this would have happened if we had taken timely action.
//But the Cypriot people have once again risen to the occasion.
//He made hard sacrifices in anticipation of the reversal of what he suffered.
//Knowing how difficult the road was, the government of Nicos Anastasiades took the burden of responsibility on its shoulders.
//It is widely accepted that the economic and fiscal recovery effort undertaken by Cyprus has yielded results far better than expected.
//And these results are due to a significant extent to the resilience shown by the Cypriot economy.
//Exactly three years later, Cyprus came out of the memorandum. We have regained our dignity and our national sovereignty as a country.
//Dear friends, We listen to the agony of our fellow citizens who are still suffering.
//No one disagrees that the unemployment rate recorded in February at 12.6% by Eurostat remains high.
// But at the same time, no one can deny that unemployment has started to fall.
//Our main goal is for every citizen to have quality work in his/her field of specialization.
//We are neither celebrating nor triumphant, but we are saying that we are on the right track.
//There are problems and we still have a long way to go.
// But we must remain committed to the steady course we have been following for the last three years.
//We place particular emphasis on providing incentives for the reintegration of unemployed people into the labour market and the acquisition of valuable work experience.
//Because our goal and the goal of the government is not to subsidize unemployment, but instead to subsidize work.
//Through the implementation of emergency training plans for employees in hotel units that are in total or partial suspension of operations during the winter season, we have achieved the extension of the tourist season by 2 months.
//The implementation of the policy to extend the opening hours of general stores created more than 8,000 new jobs,
//while the retail trade sector was the only sector that showed growth in 2014-2015.
//Dear friends, It is with great concern that we have recently recorded a tendency of certain groups to take advantage of the election period we are going through.
//To claim or impose on the state, either justified or unjustified demands.
//Those who pay the cost of closed ports or understaffed hospitals are the citizens, the patients, the entire Cypriot society and economy.
//We believe that the time has come to ensure that by claiming what we believe is ours, we do not cause incalculable damage to our fellow citizens or the economy.
//To this end, the Democratic Rally will take a political and legislative initiative and will promote a proposal that 6 months before the elections no new demands will be considered by any organized group or group.
//Dear friends, the Democratic Rally believes in the potential of the private sector.
// We know that sustainable growth will not come through increased government spending, but will come through private investment.
//A prerequisite for creating conditions for sustainable development is to have a functioning state with a strong public service.
//We do not demonise private initiative, nor business profit.
//We want our businesses to be active and profitable again.
//Because without earning, they can neither develop new sectors nor create jobs.
//This is why we are moving towards simplifying procedures and reforming the state for the citizen and the economy.
//At this point I want to praise the responsible attitude shown by the trade union movement.
//We know well that the results are not visible to all citizens yet.
//Alas, however, if we risk the sacrifices that citizens have made so far. Which have laid a solid foundation for a better tomorrow.
// We have an obligation not to allow a reversion to past attitudes, in order to avoid the traumatic experiences we have had.
//We will not risk the sacrifices of the people and the workers for temporary political gain.
//We will remain the permanent enemies of populism, reckless wishes and catchy slogans.
//Our goal is to build a better Cyprus with responsibility, rationality and wisdom.
//A prosperous Cyprus, with an attractive environment for investment that will provide quality jobs for its citizens.
//Our economy is already becoming more competitive, as shown by recent Eurostat reports.
//This will further facilitate our businesses to continue to grow and create jobs.
//Growth and employment go together.
//In order to boost employment we must necessarily have growth.
//This is our goal.To make the optimistic forecasts of the rating agencies regarding growth a reality
// and in this way to boost employment.
Thank you.
Speech by Mr. Averof Neophytou, President of the Democratic Rally of Cyprus "Lessons from the management of the Economic Crisis in Greece and Cyprus: the next day "Sunday, February 28, 2016, Haroupomili, Limassol
Friends,
I want to welcome you to today's debate.
My friend Kyriakos Mitsotakis,
You honour us today with your presence.
//In your face we see a Greece of responsibility and dignity, a better, a different Greece.
//We are fighting for Greece and its course.
//First of all as Greeks, but also because we know well that Greece and Cyprus can only progress when they progress together.
//It is no coincidence that we chose Limassol to exchange views on managing the economic crisis and creating the next day.
//This city embodies the hope and the will for a better tomorrow for our people. It best represents the will for progress.
//I would also like to thank the two eminent professors we have with us today, Mr. Stavros Zenios and Mr. George Pagoulatos.
//They have both left their imprint firmly on the effort to make our states better and to put political life back on a sound and transparent footing.
//Thanks also to Frisos Savvidis, a close friend and colleague, for agreeing to be the moderator of tonight's discussion.
//Friends and Friends, Exactly three years after March 2013, Cyprus exits the Memorandum of Understanding.
//We as a country are losing our dignity and our national sovereignty.
//We become masters of our country again.
//And it is precisely at this moment, after all that has been demanded, that we have to take a step back, so that we can see the big picture.
//Most importantly, only then will we be able to calmly decide the jumps that need to be made.
//Friends and Friends, Years ago we had an illusory prosperity while our country's image abroad was plummeting.
//On the one hand we were spending as a state much more than we had.
//On the other hand, our banking system has developed far beyond the borders and the country's capabilities.
//The great crisis has found us with needs of 10 billion euros for the state and another 10 billion euros for the banks.
//But the problem was not only financial. Our country was never modernized enough to be able to meet today's needs.
//Bureaucracy, an economy based on only 2-3 vulnerable sectors, clientelism, opacity, lack of effective accountability mechanisms and lack of proper oversight structures in a state that preferred to be a businessman rather than a regulator, were just some of our many structural problems.
//In addition to these institutional weaknesses, there was the reluctance to take necessary decisions by the left-wing government we had.
//We have experienced the denial of reality, the obsessive perception that states cannot go bankrupt, the indifference to the great challenges of the globalised economy, the attempt to hide the problems under the carpet and pass the bomb on to the next generation.
//We were criminally late in turning to the support mechanism.
//We have had to face alone not only our own problem, but also the weaknesses of the Eurosystem, paying for European mistakes.
//Europe is not without responsibility for what has happened in our countries.
// The union proved to be weak and unprepared to handle such a crisis.
//Here in Cyprus, it is reasonable to complain that unprecedented measures have been applied in an attempt to send messages across Europe.
//But none of this would have happened if we had taken timely action.
//Nothing would have happened if we had listened when we demanded spending restraint and urgent action to address the problems.
//Friends and Friends,In March 2013, the 15-day government of Nicos Anastasiades was called upon to take difficult, painful, but necessary decisions.
//And we have fought a constant battle over the last three years to hold back the crowns of populism and resounding no's.
//And we achieved this through the bravery and responsibility of our people.
//We kept our cool and rolled up our sleeves.
//The Cypriot people have once again risen to the occasion.
//He made hard sacrifices in anticipation of the reversal of what he suffered.
//Knowing how difficult the road was, the government of Nicos Anastasiades took the burden of responsibility on its shoulders.
//And despite the fact that we are a parliamentary minority government, we succeeded in the parliament in forming the alliances that passed all the memorandum bills.
//And we credit opposition parties, especially DIKO, for supporting the country's stabilisation process.
//As a result, even the most skeptical observer can see that the Cypriot economy has not only stabilized, but is now on a growth track.
//Public finances have been tidied up.
//Since the day the memorandum was signed, not a single new tax has been imposed.
Friends,
//Cyprus is becoming more reliable today than ever before, both economically and nationally, but also at the European level.
//Our small country becomes an example of a modern feat!
//But the problems in the real economy are still there.
//The wounds have not yet healed.
//Through the crisis, we should be able to come out with a more modern and more effective state.
//To make the best Cyprus.
//This is why we are working today.On three main axes based on our values and principles. Our ideas and philosophy.
//The first one is the de-linking of profit.
//We want our businesses to be active and profitable again.
//Because without earning, they can neither develop new sectors nor create jobs.
//The second axis is the creation of a reliable environment for attracting investment.
//The fight against bureaucracy, confidence in our country.
//Without trust and credibility, no foreigner will invest in our country.
//And without foreign investment there can be no rapid economic growth, prosperity and jobs.
//We stand firmly against the logic that wants our citizens to be dependent on state benefits.
//The Cypriot citizen is looking for a decent job, which will reward him based on his qualifications and abilities. Not state handouts.
//A real social policy is the right to remunerative work.
//The third axis is reform everywhere.
//Our country is finally changing.
//Cyprus turns a page.
//We have proceeded with the huge reform of the Minimum Guaranteed Income.
//We are moving forward in reforming the state for the citizen and the economy.
//We bring mobility in the public sector and the linking of salaries to the economic development of the country.
//We are moving towards the implementation of e-government.
//We work to have quality education for our children.
//We start health care reform with the patient at the centre and not the interests.
//Citizen-centred reform in local government.
//We have reduced military service, modernising our army, because we care about our young people.
//Modernising agricultural production.
//We promote the system of faster and better quality justice.
//Here in Limassol, we are completing the process of entrusting the Port's activities to strategic investors, creating new, huge prospects for our country.
//We are working methodically and in full cooperation with Greece on the great energy opportunity that lies ahead of us.
//Building strong alliances across the region.
//And at the same time, we reduce the financial burden and the burden on the citizen, reducing a wasteful and inefficient state.
//We are working on radical, game-changing reforms.
//We know well that the results are not visible to all citizens yet.
//But alas, if we risk all these sacrifices that we have made and have laid the solid foundation for a better next day for our country.
//Also, if we confirm all those who fear that we will not manage on our own, without the Troika.
//We are determined to refute them.
//And this is a clear message to both the organised groups and the business world.
//We will not risk the sacrifices of this people for any temporary political gain.
//We will remain the permanent enemies of populism, of reckless wishes and catchy slogans.
//We are building the best Cyprus and we are determined to succeed.
//Always in the first line. With responsibility, rationality and prudence.
//As well as we will insist on trying to reach an honourable compromise on our national issue.
//A compromise that will unleash the true potential of our entire Cyprus.
//And this united Cyprus will be the truly better Cyprus.
//Friends and Friends, this is our mission today. To create a confident and hopeful country.
//An ambitious country that will take off without leaving anyone behind.
Thank you.
Speech by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the Workshop on Geostrategic Issues, in cooperation with the CSCMM "Eastern Mediterranean: The Role of NATO, the EU and Russia".Monday, 25 April 2016, CIIM, KEMA Building, 6.00 pm
Dear Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides,
Friend Christo, Director of the Cyprus Study Centre,
Dear guests,
//It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to tonight's conference co-organized by the Democratic Rally and the Cyprus Centre for Studies entitled: "Eastern Mediterranean: The Role of NATO, the EU and Russia".
//Dear friends,Until a few years ago, most European citizens watched developments in the troubled region of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East with indifference.
//Few people realised that the moment would come when developments in far-off Iraq, or Syria, would directly affect the lives of German and French citizens.
//Today, of course, this perception has been completely reversed.
//It is with particular concern that we are watching the escalation of political instability and deadly conflicts in the wider Eastern Mediterranean region.
//The area that is also our own neighbourhood.
//An escalation that at times gives the image of a total war, where everyone is fighting against everyone.
//There is no doubt that the Western world has its own responsibilities.
//Wrong assessments, insufficient knowledge of the socio-political realities in the Muslim world and a series of wrong political and military choices contributed to the strengthening of religious fanaticism and the collapse of the fragile balance in the region.
//The loss of innocent lives and human misery have unfortunately become a dangerous and daily reality for millions of people.
//As the drama of millions of refugees continues, the European Union is failing to manage the worst humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II.
//The cohesion and the strength of the European edifice are being tested,
//while across Europe, the rise of far-right and nationalist movements is pushing many European leaders to take decisions that call into question the vision of European integration.
//Additionally, the fear of terrorism has recently been spreading around the world.
// The recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as the sabotage of the Russian airliner on Mount Sinai, remind us that the danger of terrorism and religious fundamentalism cannot be confined to a few distant countries. It has now moved to the heart of Europe.
//The international community must act in a coordinated manner within the framework of a political agreement that addresses the causes that created the current crisis.
// Only through social reconstruction and the re-establishment of functioning states can peace be achieved in the region.
//The European Union can and must play a leading role in this effort.
// Instead of devoting all its efforts to finding ways to stop the refugees, it should take initiatives that will bring all the parties involved to the dialogue table under the auspices of the United Nations.
//Finding a political agreement between all those who oppose the religious terrorism of the Islamic State is imperative.
//An agreement that will provide for a transitional period and which will allow the Syrian people to decide democratically on their future and their political leadership.
//We know that NATO, E. EU and Russia have different approaches and even conflicting interests in the wider Eastern Mediterranean region.
//At the same time, Turkey's controversial role further complicates efforts to coordinate action.
// But it is equally understandable that only through joint action and a convergence of objectives can the causes that led to the creation of the Islamic State and the social collapse of the states of the region be addressed.
// It is therefore necessary to find common ground and achieve a convergence of the interests pursued.
//Cyprus, as the closest EU member state in the region, can become a hub for diplomatic, economic and political cooperation.
//A fact that is confirmed by the excellent diplomatic and strategic relations that Cyprus already has with all the countries of the region, the USA and Russia.
//Dear friends, Apart from the political instability, there have also been significant, positive developments in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
//The discovery of significant hydrocarbon deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean region is a development that creates conditions for a wider convergence of interests among all countries in the region, including Turkey.
//Both the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the generalized flare-up in the Middle East region have highlighted the need for the creation of alternative energy sources as never before.
//Not coincidentally, high on the new Commission's priorities is the decoupling of Europe from Russian gas.
// Through cooperation and the use of all available resources and infrastructure of the Member States of the Union and neighbouring countries to create alternative energy routes.
//Cyprus, due to its geostrategic position, can play an important role in creating conditions of stability, peace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean.
//Hydrocarbon deposits, both in the EEZ of Cyprus and in the EEZs of neighbouring countries, if exploited with prudence and proper planning, can be a powerful factor of stability and security for the wider Eastern Mediterranean region.
//Creating conditions of cooperation and mutual benefit for many states in the region.
//In order to realize this coupling of interests for the wider benefit of the region, it is clear that it presupposes the resolution of the Cyprus problem.
//Both the government and the Democratic Rally are working hard and systematically in this direction,
//so that the international actor can play a more active role towards Turkey, helping it to understand that it is in its own interest to find a solution.
//A solution based on the relevant Security Council resolutions and incorporating European principles and values on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
//To conclude my greeting, I would like to reiterate something that I truly believe. That out of great challenges and difficulties, great opportunities are born.
// It is up to us to seize them and use them for the good of our people.
Thank you.
Speech by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof NeophytouTotal Political RallyThursday, 19 March 2016, Metropolitan Hall, Nicosia, 7.00 pm
Friends,
Youth and Young People,
//We have the great honour to have with us today, the man who fought important, crucial and victorious battles for the Democratic Rally.
// Battles that determined the course of the party.
//And above all, the perspective of our country.
//Our man today is the President of the Republic of Cyprus.
// Nicos Anastasiades, who leads Cyprus with plan, boldness, determination and confidence.
//Dear President, thank you. For being with us today and giving us strength in the final stretch of this effort.
//Friends and Friends,
//On Sunday, citizens decide on the future of the country.
// These parliamentary elections are particularly important.
// Important because Cyprus is at a crucial crossroads.
//And the dilemma is: Do we continue on the path of stability or risk turning back?
//The stable course of the country is judged.
//With the efforts and sacrifices of our citizens we have achieved a lot.
//These sacrifices should not and will not be wasted.
//This is why we must continue and complete the work that has been started.
// We must not let Cyprus go back!
//Our President Nicos Anastasiades, the Syriza world will not let Cyprus go back!
// With collective effort we achieved the exit from the memorandum.
// With the wisdom, maturity and resilience of our citizens, we overcame obstacles that seemed insurmountable.
//What we have achieved, however, is endangered by the scourge of populism.
//And we experienced populism and its consequences.
// We are one step away from disaster.
//And we in the Democratic Rally do not play the future of the country in the dice of populism.
//We do not sacrifice what we have achieved on the altar of the personal ambitions that some have chosen.
//Dear ones, we have both a strategy and a plan. And we are moving forward.
//The country is settled.
//We went from recession to growth.
//Trimming public finances is bearing its first fruits.
//Only our government and the Democratic Rally know how to grow the tree of development.
//As good landlords, we return to society the first fruits of the toil and labour of citizens.
//Priority is given to the unemployed and socially vulnerable groups.
//And I stress that these fruits that we are returning to the citizens are not borrowed. They are the result of Cyprus' economic progress.
//Based on the surpluses, the gradual rehabilitation of those who have suffered costs from the financial crisis begins.
// But also the gradual reduction of taxes.
//The tax cut is a vote of confidence in the course of the economy.
// And confidence in the economy means a perspective for the country.
//A perspective that creates new jobs.
// Because our priority was and remains the reduction of unemployment.
//From champions of the rise in unemployment that the previous ones have made us,
// today we are becoming the champions of reduction in the whole of Europe.
// We are not celebrating while there are still our fellow citizens, young people and scientists, who cannot yet find the jobs they deserve.
//Friends and Friends,
My dear President,
//On Sunday at the ballot box the people of the Democratic Union will send a strong message
//To confirm that the Democratic Union remains the dominant political force of the country
//Proud Unionists, all together on the front line
//Until the polls close, this message will reach every home
//No one from the Union will abstain. Abstention is taking us backwards.
//Friends and Friends, For those who are thinking about abstaining, or other options, just invite them to remember where Cyprus was three years ago.
//At this point I want to address those Democratic Rally voters who are unhappy.
//I understand that in this very difficult course so far, mistakes have been made.
//These fellow citizens may be thinking about either abstaining from the elections, or making other choices.
In this way they are only punishing Cyprus and its prospects.
//I ask them to join us again to correct our mistakes,
//but also to build the better Cyprus that we deserve.
//People remember where the previous Christofias administration brought them.
//And he remembers that it was not only AKEL that voted for Christofias.
//So let's not provoke any more by underestimating the intelligence of the world.
//Those who denigrate what happened just want to take us back.
// The policies of the previous five years, which plunged the country into uncertainty and a deep economic crisis.
//It is sad that instead of self-criticism and silence, they choose to nullify the efforts and achievements of the Cypriot people.
//We all know how easy it is to tear down.
//And we also know how difficult it is to build.
//The previous ones brought the country down.
// In three years the Anastasiades government has corrected a lot.
//And set the stage for even more to come!
//We give them away and leave them in the past and their dead ends and take the future of the Cypriot people in our hands.
//For the Democratic Rally the challenge is the future.
//And together we are already winning this bet!
//We know well that the exit of the country from the memorandum does not mean a definitive solution to all problems. But it does mean regaining credibility and national sovereignty.
//But to change Cyprus, we need Cypriot citizens on our side.
//Why? Because a strong Democratic Rally means a strong government that will get the job done.
//Women and men, the world demands justice and a crackdown on corruption. And finally, for the first time, there are results.
//Those who today are shouting against corruption were part of the governments that bred this phenomenon.
//I want to remind them that there have been allegations of scandals in the past, but no investigation and no result.
//For the first time ever, there has been a result only from this government.
// Words are cheap and easy.
//For the first time at last, words become deeds.
//For the first time, corruption is beaten and guilty people are brought to jail.
//Let me make one more thing clear. The fight against corruption has no colour.
// And we all have to respect the decisions of the judiciary.
//It can't be someone else's fight against corruption, if he is "of the party" he is a "political prisoner".
//Friends and Friends, We go forward to the elections with clear positions, with confidence and assurance.
//We were and we are always the party for the difficult.
//With Glafkos Clerides, we achieved national reconciliation after the national catastrophe of 1974.
//We have achieved the accession of Cyprus to Europe, the greatest strategic victory ever achieved by the Republic of Cyprus.
// To speak today about European law, European principles and the European acquis.
//Today, with Nicos Anastasiades at the helm, we saved the country.
// We have reversed the dramatic facts left behind by the previous government.
//Cyprus succeeded because we joined forces with society and we succeeded.
//We all stand by the President of the Republic, Nicos Anastasiades, in the struggle for a viable and functional solution to our national problem.
//We support him with all our strength so that we can once again see our country united.
//Dear friends, Cyprus is at a crucial point.
//We must not risk returning to attitudes and practices that have brought us to the brink of collapse and the brink of bankruptcy.
//This is why the elections on 22 May are particularly important.
//This is why abstaining from elections gives a pass to the past. And to what we have lived through.
//We will not let this happen!
//Democratic Rally is the force for a stable perspective for Cyprus.
//This is the proud Democratic Rally!
//Come on, let's move forward together!
//Come together to make the vision a reality.
//The vision of a free, united and proud homeland!
//An ambitious country that will take off, leaving no one behind.
//Together, we will take Cyprus forward!
//Together on Sunday we will shout again, earthquake, earthquake Alarm.
Speech by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the OEB Economy Conference entitled "Challenges of Cyprus Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship, Investment, Extroversion" Thursday, 21 April 2016, Cleopatra Hotel, Nicosia, 4:00pm.
//Dear speakers,
Friends,
It is with great pleasure that I am with you today at the Federation of Employers' & Employees' Conference on the Economy. Industrialists' Federation on "Challenges of Cyprus Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship, Investment, Extroversion".
//I would like to add "Opportunities" to the apt theme.
//Because where there are challenges in business, there are also opportunities.
//And it is these opportunities that we should not let go to waste, but rather seize and exploit them creatively and productively.
//Friends and Friends,
It is clear that the triptych of Entrepreneurship, Investment and Extroversion is a vital factor for competitiveness and economic growth.
//First, when we talk about "business" we mean private initiative and productive activity.
//The existing private initiative, which is enduring. And it has withstood the hardships.
//Existing businesses, and industries that are fighting every day, not just to survive. But to become more competitive and more innovative.
//Who go outside the borders of our small country with dynamism and extroversion.
//It is the collective effort that brought Cyprus to record an economic growth of slightly less than 2% in 2015 with positive prospects for 2016.
//In just two years Cyprus has the highest growth rate in the last 7 years.
//It is widely accepted that the economic and fiscal recovery effort undertaken by Cyprus has yielded results far better than expected.
//And these results are due to a significant extent to the resilience shown by the Cypriot economy, and Cypriot business.
//I often refer to the best Cyprus.
//The best Cyprus is the Cyprus that creates.
// The one that often remains hidden behind the daily grumbling and the word of misery.
//But there is the Cyprus of creation and production.
// With Cypriot raw materials, with the knowledge and talent of Cypriots.
//Cypriot products with claims.
// This is the best Cyprus. And you know it very well, perhaps better than anyone else, because you are part of it.
//I believe in a better Cyprus because Cyprus has potential and has proven it.
//And we envision the Cyprus of entrepreneurship, of creation, of perspective.
//We envision a Cyprus that will add value and create better days for our children.
//You people of entrepreneurship and labour do not ask for privileges or favours from the state.
// You ask only one thing: that we stop putting obstacles in your way.
//Make the state more friendly to entrepreneurs, industrialists, craftsmen, producers.
// Support your effort.
//And let us politicians stop thinking that the people who produce and the businessmen are the "bad guys with profits". Because they are the ones who contribute to the economy and society.
//When you are outside, in the fields and at the sea, in the industries, in the crafts and in the workshops, you understand that not only the workers, but thousands of families live from them.
//At the same time, when we talk about entrepreneurship, we also mean innovation and the involvement of young people in business.
//For the better future of our country, it is our obligation to create structures and tools that will provide the necessary tools for Cyprus' talent to innovate and build its future.
//After all, the most important weapon of our small country is none other than the human wealth, the stubbornness, the knowledge and the enthusiasm of the people of Cyprus.
//It is the duty of the state to provide the tools and the opportunities to make our country innovative, competitive and innovative.
//To develop in high value-added sectors but also to become competitive through innovation.
//For a developed, modern Cyprus tomorrow, we must create today, the structures that will allow Cypriot minds to flourish.
//And it is clear that entrepreneurial innovation and start-ups are the basis for the new economic model that will power the economy.
// Allowing Cypriot business to spread its wings and conquer foreign markets.
//Cypriots since ancient times have been endowed with an innate extroversion and Cypriot businesses are active all over the world.
//Continually seek opportunities abroad, operate in markets and compete head-to-head with giants.
//This extroversion of Cypriot businesses and industries has held back the economy and that is where the field offers opportunities for geometric growth.
//Friends and Friends, "Investments" for us are investments from both the Cypriot private sector and from abroad.
//Cyprus exits the Memorandum three years later having regained its dignity and national sovereignty.
// This is the time to take a mental step back so that we can see the big picture and the path of change we still need to achieve.
//The false prosperity, the unreliability of our country abroad, the costly state.
//A system with outdated state structures left since the 1960s to bureaucracy.
// An economy based on only 2-3 sectors, with clientelism, with lack of transparency, with no effective accountability mechanisms and with no proper oversight structures.
//A state that preferred to be a businessman rather than a regulator.
//Our country has never been modernized enough to meet today's needs.
// Let challenges grow and put obstacles in the way of Cypriot business.
//Dear friends, today even the most sceptical observer can see that Cyprus is becoming more reliable than ever before at all levels.
// With wise policies and political consensus and with a society standing up to the occasion, small Cyprus has become an example of a modern feat.
//Have all the problems been solved? Clearly not.
//You represent the productive sector of the economy and you know it very well.
//The problems in the real economy are still there.
// And this is the challenge of the next day: to emerge from the crisis with a more modern and more effective state, a supporter of Cypriot entrepreneurship.
//The big challenge before us today is to build a better Cyprus. The Cyprus of entrepreneurship, of competitiveness, of growth.
// This is the great challenge: to remain steady on the path towards a better Cyprus, away from the sirens of populism.
// Cyprus has expertise, talented human resources and resilient, visionary businesses. Necessary ingredients to be able to take advantage of global and European trends and developments.
// This is the creative Cyprus we are working for today.
// Based on three main pillars based on our values and principles.
// The first is the de-legitimization of profit and business.
//Profit is a blessing. Not anathema. Damn is the damage.
// We want our businesses to be active and profitable again. Because without winning, they can neither develop new sectors, nor invest, nor create jobs.
//The second axis is the creation of a reliable environment for attracting foreign investment.
//The fight against bureaucracy, and the full recovery of confidence in our country.
//Without trust and credibility, no foreigner will invest in our country.
// And without foreign investment there can be no rapid economic growth, prosperity and jobs.
//At the same time, the development of research and innovation can be a pillar for attracting foreign investment.
//Investment in innovation sectors, which has the potential and can become an important arm of our economy.
// They are a perspective that has the potential to place Cyprus among the high-tech countries
//The third axis is reform everywhere.
//We are moving forward in reforming the state for the citizen and the economy.
//We are moving towards the implementation of e-government which will reduce the administrative burden of private sector transactions with the public sector.
//To achieve economic growth, however, in order to provide a fertile environment for creation and prosperity, the important steps towards the total reform of the state must become even more tangible.
/ / / We must courageously move forward with radical reforms of mindsets and processes.
// To continue the policy of reform and change even now that we are not under any memorandum.
//The completion of the process of assigning the activities of the Port of Limassol to strategic investors creates new, huge prospects for our country.
//And this is the path we must follow. Work for radical, game-changing reforms.
//Friends and Friends, The sophistry of "numbers prosper and people suffer" is nothing but a recipe for inertia, a passport to the persistence of crisis and misery.
//We remain committed to the right path.
//We maintain the stable perspective of a better Cyprus.
Thank you.
Bless you.
Address by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr.Averof Neophytou at the Conference of the Federation of Parents and Guardians of Private Education SchoolsWednesday, 23 March 2016, 10.30 am
//Dear parents, students, teachers,
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address your conference today on the admission of graduates of private schools to public universities.
//If we all agree that young people are the future of this country, then surely we can also agree that the education provided will determine the quality of that future for future generations.
//The first and most crucial step to solve a problem is to acknowledge its existence. And it is a fact that in our country, the Education Sector has been facing serious problems for many years.
//Problems that those in power - all of us - either didn't see, or pretended not to see.
//To avoid taking responsibility on hot issues.
//And the possible confrontation with various interest groups.
//Cyprus is the first among the EU member-states in terms of the amount of public spending on education.
//Unfortunately, the results of this spending are not as expected.
//This is confirmed both by the results of international assessments and by the performance of our students within our own educational system.
//We see our graduates unable to enter the labour market in their field of study.
//This was the case even before the crisis Because our education system, whether in secondary or higher education, has for years been alienated from the changing needs of society and the labour market.
//We are particularly pleased because this government and this particular Minister of Education are not trying to hide the problems under the carpet.
// They are determined to move forward - and we are moving forward - with the reforms and the necessary changes that our Education is so much in need of.
//For us, it is our conviction that Education is the key of every society to exit from economic, social and institutional deadlocks.
//Dear friends, it has been and remains a firm position of the Democratic Rally that the State must treat both the public sector and the private sector equally.
//as well as Private Education.
// To provide equal opportunities and possibilities for all students, whether they attend public or private school.
//Today, about 18% of students attend private education.
//Parents who choose private school for their children, in addition to the taxes they pay, essentially relieve the state of a large cost.
//Dear parents, some political parties, or even our fellow citizens, have a negative bias towards you, simply because you chose private school for your children.
// Either because they are ideologically opposed to private initiative,
// or because they have been given the false impression that you come from privileged social strata.
//But the truth is that you are the middle class of this country, the people next door.
//Unfortunately, in our country we create myths with the greatest ease, which we reproduce in an undocumented way.
//If there is one thing that Cypriots do not consider the financial cost, it is investing in the education of their children.
//What we also see from the very high rates of graduates in higher education.
//There are many reasons that may lead a parent to choose Private Education over Public Education and they are certainly not limited to the financial situation of each family.
//Nor is the claim that all private school students are destined to study at universities abroad.
// A prospect that has also been overturned for many families as a consequence of the economic crisis that thousands of our fellow citizens are still experiencing.
//Based on the latest educational survey conducted by the Statistical Service of our country in 2013, the total current public expenditure per pupil in public educational institutions has been calculated at 6.308 euros in primary education and 9.777 euros in secondary education.
//This cost takes into account the existing infrastructure in education, technical equipment, as well as the administrative and teaching staff required for each student.
//In 2013 there were 4,201 students attending private primary education and 10,830 students attending private secondary education.
// If the students currently attending private primary and secondary schools were added to public education, one can easily calculate that public expenditure would increase by about 130 million euros per year.
// If we take into account the need to build additional schools, this cost would be even higher.
//What would be the impact on the quality of public education provided if today, under the current economic conditions, the state were required to spend an additional 130 million euros per year?
// It is clear to us that the Education of the country benefits overall from your contribution.
// As it is clear that this state has over time wronged you.
// Not only did it not offer you any financial assistance, but to this day it excludes private school students from access to the public universities of the country.
//We want our Universities, Public Universities
//and Private, to make the best use of our graduating students.
// We want to keep our most excellent and charismatic young people in our country.
//This cannot be done if we exclude in advance from Public Universities students who are graduates of private secondary schools.
//Excluding, that is, one fifth of our young people.
//We welcome the submission of a specific proposal by the government that finally gives the right to private school graduates to claim admission to the Public Universities of the country.
//Without affecting any position currently offered to public school students.
//We call on all political forces to support this proposal.
//For many years we have been praying as the Democratic Rally for this positive development.
//Permit me, however, to express the view that we cannot make the leap forward with half-measures.
//We want our universities to become competitive.
//This is why we believe that the admission of students to them should not be done in a flattening way.
//Each university should have its own selection criteria.
//Criteria that will promote academic excellence and that will treat all students equally.
//OkEL's friends tell us that they will not allow the University of Cyprus to become the Oxford of Cyprus.
// We answer them that we will not allow them to turn the University of Cyprus into the Lumumba of Cyprus.
//Because selecting the best according to objective criteria is called investing in the future and academic excellence, not elitism.
// It is the opposite that cements mediocrity and flattening.
//As for the issue of the large savings of public funds from the choice of private education, it is a matter that is high time to be put on the agenda of the public debate on education.
//That is, how the state could support private education and provide incentives for parents to choose it, so that on the one hand we could save available state resources and on the other hand we could raise the quality of the education provided for our children.
//Dear parents, students and teachers, Any attempt to change attitudes and reform is bound to be accompanied by reactions.
//We declare unreservedly that we will support this effort, regardless of the political cost.
//To finally create an education system that focuses on students and the needs of our society.
// And we still have a lot to do.
//We want to listen to the concerns and problems that exist.
// But also to seize the great opportunities and possibilities offered through their resolution, to build a robust Tomorrow.
//Far from slogans, petty political or trade union agendas, we are committed to being beneficial and productive.
// We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our children.
Thank you.
Presentation by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the event entitled: "Health Care Reforms and the Prospect of a Sustainable General Health Plan" Wednesday 2 March, "Filoxenia" Conference Centre, Nicosia, 6:00pm.
Honorable Minister of Health and Deputy Minister to the President,
Special guests,
Dear friends,
//It is a great pleasure to welcome you today to the debate we are holding on the huge challenges facing the health sector in our country.
//In a society that is constantly evolving and changing, creating new and daily increasing health needs and challenges, it is necessary to modernize and adapt the country's health system accordingly.
//Especially when this system shows strong signs of fatigue, weaknesses and distortions, inefficiencies and problems.
//Problems that prevent us from moving forward, that do not allow us to address the ever-increasing health needs of our citizens.
//After the great economic challenge, the memorandum and the very hard sacrifices our society has had to endure, health and education should be the two most important priorities.
//These two areas reflect the social face but also summarise the rating of the services that a state provides to its constituent society.
//The permanent and current problems, the inadequate organization of our hospitals, the low quality of services provided, the inequality of the system towards the citizens, the health units that, due to the antiquated system, inconvenience the patient and - above all - the waiting lists, create a climate of distrust and insecurity for the citizen.
//Friends and friends, it is necessary and imperative that we intervene courageously with a series of breakthroughs at all levels of the health system and initiate the necessary changes.
//It is very true that in the name of the implementation of the GESY, public hospitals were left for decades without modernization, without anyone taking the necessary measures to be able to meet the demands and needs of the time and the patients.
//It is equally true that over the decades, the private sector has experienced a huge uncertainty about what will eventually happen.
// This does not allow him to make the requirements that would correspond to a general system.
//The greater truth, however, is that no health system can be implemented unless our hospitals are first given administrative and financial autonomy and reorganized.
//Because otherwise, not only will they not be able to cope with the competition, but they will collapse.
//In a proper health care system, the patient should not have to distinguish between public and private hospitals.
//On the contrary, every citizen should feel confident that they can choose the doctor and the organisation that will best treat them in a completely universal system.
//The citizen has every right to resent the indecisiveness and inability of the Cypriot state to implement a health system, a reform on which it has been working for 25 years.
//We are not honoured as a country that we are the only one in the European Union that does not have such a system.
//But there is no sense in holding as gospel a design that was made 25 years ago.
// It is inconceivable that we do not take into account at all the huge international experience gained from then until today, but also that we do not want to cost this planning and care about the cost and the impact on public finances and the economy at large.
//Today, Cyprus is privileged to have a government determined to make bold reforms in all areas.
// We want to end this term leaving behind a better Cyprus at all levels.
//And I want to be clear: Cyprus cannot be better if it does not offer its citizens better quality health services.
// If it is not put on a track that will give every citizen the security of knowing that they will receive, whenever they need it, the proper care, without worrying whether they can have it, or whether they can pay for it.
//This is a condition that every developed state must serve.
//Today, as never before, there is a broad social consensus for reform in health care as well.
// A reform that has been delayed for decades.
//We abolished and replaced the 15-day work period with 6-month contracts and permanent status.
//Decisions and initiatives have been taken that partially relieve the hospitals.
//The arduous process of the autonomy and upgrading of public hospitals will give us the little time needed to study substantially any corrections that need to be made to our design.
//And since there will be this transitional stage, the state can come out with outsourcing, where there are waiting lists.
//This will give us the ability to self-share and reorganise our hospitals, with the pressure of daily life and weaknesses significantly reduced.
//To finally lead as soon as possible to a patient-centred Health Plan and the preservation of the patient's dignity.
//A system that will ensure the improvement and upgrading of the quality of health services provided to citizens.
//A sustainable Health Plan that ensures universal access to quality health care, with transparent governance.
//And a plan that will stand up in economic terms and that the economy and the state can sustain and serve it as it deserves.
//Friends and Friends, I will not tire of repeating.
/ / / We must courageously move forward with radical reforms.
//Continue the policy of reform and change even when we are not under the memorandum process.
// And these reforms clearly also concern the health system.
//A developed state without a sustainable and effective Health Plan is not possible.
//We are fully aware of the difficulties of the project.
// But we are also listening to society's demand that we must move quickly.
//And I assure you that in our political culture the interests of all citizens are above all.
//We do not govern or make political decisions in the interest of particular groups or individuals or a few.
//For us, national capital and national investment is not only the expenditure made by the state but also private investment.
//This is how we see them and this is how we deal with them.
//How we recognize the problem in public hospitals,
//we also recognize the problem in private hospitals, which are also at the limits of their viability.
//The Minister of Health is not only a minister of public health but also of private health.
/ / / Works and operates with the aim of providing excellent service in the health sector wherever it comes from.
//This is how we see the exercise of our civic duties.
//Friends and Friends,
Dear guests,
I look forward to your comments and the debate that will follow, so that we can all play a constructive role in the changes we expect for an integrated and effective General Health System.
//I am optimistic that we can do it.
And we will succeed.
Thank you.
Presentation by the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the event entitled "The prospects for Cyprus Tourism" Tuesday, 15 March 2016, Golden Bay Hotel, Larnaca.
Honourable Minister of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism,
Your Honour, Mr. Deputy Minister to the President,
Dear speakers,
Friends,
//It is a great pleasure and honour to be with you tonight at the event we are organising on "The prospects for Cyprus Tourism".
//Tourism has always been one of the most important industries in our country
//Our small country attracts millions of tourists every year who come to enjoy its incomparable beauty.
//Friends and Friends, as far as the country's tourism policy is concerned, we have largely focused on a sun and sea model for decades;
//But all the neighbouring Mediterranean countries have sun and sea;
//Crete, an island smaller than Cyprus, received in 2013 from Heraklion airport alone, close to 2.5 million tourists.
In total, arrivals from the two airports alone (Heraklion and Chania) were over 3 million tourists.
//In the World Tourism Organization's ranking tables on arrivals and receipts of each country, as well as in the latest edition of the World Economic Forum's annual report on tourism and travel competitiveness, Cyprus in 2015 comes only 36th out of 141 countries.
//In a comparative analysis that we made in November 2014 between comparable hotel units in Greece and Cyprus, it was clearly demonstrated that Cypriot Hotels are burdened with lower electricity costs by 36%, lower Municipal Tax by 6%, increased payroll costs by 15% and Property Tax by 20 times more.
//The picture revealed by the comparative analysis is clear: The Cypriot tourism product is less competitive than the Greek one, burdened by higher costs.
//Ladies and Friends, The spread of new technologies and new media offers new possibilities and opportunities for the development of tourism activities.
//Modern trends in the international tourism environment and the intense competitive conditions require renewal and diversification of the tourism product,
//orientation of the destination to the international market,
//exploitation of opportunities and specific targeting of promotional actions.
//In such an environment, in order to compete, Cyprus will undoubtedly have to upgrade and enrich its tourism product.
// Diversify it.
//To ensure the quality of the services provided.
//Adopt modern concepts and fast processes.
//Increase the occupancy rate of the accommodation and take advantage of our climate and weather to extend the tourist season.
/ / / It is necessary, apart from the sun and the sea, to promote other advantages of our country.
//To enter dynamically into other forms of tourism. We are already doing very good work with sports tourism.
// There are possibilities for medical tourism that we should exhaust.
//Dear Ones, The role of the CTO in the new setting must also change with its transformation and upgrading to a state ministry of tourism and focus on promoting our tourism product.
//The targeted promotion of the country's comparative advantages as a tourist destination through multiple and appropriate channels call for modern perceptions and attitudes.
//It is unthinkable that an organisation responsible for tourism should spend more than half of its annual budget on salaries instead of promoting the country.
//The need to modernize the CTO is imperative in order to achieve its goal, which is to promote Cyprus as a tourist destination.
//This is the only thing that should be focused on without spending valuable time and resources on issuing licences to leisure centres and travel agencies.
//Provisions in existing legislation that create unnecessary administrative burdens, such as the submission of price lists and invoices by leisure centres and the responsibility for implementing legislation on the qualifications and duties of tour guides, should also be removed.
//All this will have to change.
// The CTO should not remain a bureaucratic organization employing accountants and inspectors, but people specializing in marketing and focusing on this work only.
//Of course, this does not mean that any CTO employee will lose his job.
//All workers have their jobs and labour rights fully guaranteed.
//On the basis of interchangeability, they will continue to serve from another equivalent post in the wider public sector.
//Ladies and Friends, Tourism has always been an important part of our economy and can become even more important.
// The competitiveness of our tourism product is a national issue and closely linked to the prosperity of the country and the real economy.
//It is another area where we need to move forward with the radical reform of the CTO.
//Revise the regulatory framework and courageously reorganise and abolish unnecessary and bureaucratic procedures.
//So that it can focus on its main purpose of existence and the goal of attracting tourists to our country, for the benefit of the economy and the country.
//To build a better and more competitive Cyprus.
//Friends and Friends,
Dear guests,
I look forward to your contributions and the debate that will follow and I wish the event every success.
Thank you.
Position of the President of the Democratic Rally Mr. Averof Neophytou at the conference entitled "Women's entrepreneurship at the heart of economic and social development" Monday 18 April, Filoxenia Conference Centre, Nicosia, 7.00 p.m.
Special guests,
Dear friends,
//I welcome you here today, to the debate organized by the Democratic Rally, entitled "Women's Entrepreneurship at the Heart of Social and Economic Development".
//I am also very pleased to welcome Mrs.Mareva Grabovski Mitsotakis, who came to Nicosia today especially to participate in today's event, despite her very busy schedule.
I also welcome the rest of our guests who will participate in the discussion that will follow.
//Friends and friends, Modern women are active in society in multiple roles.
/ / / He chooses to work, to be involved in public and political life.
//Discriminate in science, in technology.
// Make a professional career.
//But at the same time she is a wife and mother, she creates a family and supports it.
//Things are definitely not easy.
// As much as we have reduced gender discrimination, on a practical level the difficulties remain to a large extent.
//Nevertheless, career and family, family and public life, are no longer unique options. They coexist.
//And it is through these multiple roles that women today endow themselves with important characteristics that add value to the whole.
//Friends and Friends, Women entrepreneurs in particular are becoming an important element of the global economy.
// They contribute to increasing productivity, enhancing competitiveness, economic growth and social cohesion.
//The problems, obstacles and difficulties faced by women trying to start businesses are many.
//Women's entrepreneurship is not a theory, nor is it an exception.
//We have before us a special panel of dynamic entrepreneurs with a woman's flair who prove the truth of the matter.
//In today's difficult environment and the rapid changes in the social fabric of the country, entrepreneurship is a key ingredient for healthy economic growth.
//International research reveals that companies with more women have better results.
//But beyond the studies and statistics, the simple logic is clear. Activating half the population, the well-educated half of the population makes a positive contribution to the economy and society.
//Strengthening women's entrepreneurship is therefore vital for the future course of the Cypriot economy.
//And it is necessary to be a horizontal target of public policies.
//After all, no modern state can aim for a sustainable economy and a fairer society without the activation of its entire human potential.
//Friends and friends, It is a fact that in recent years, there has been a remarkable effort to strengthen female entrepreneurship.
//But above all, we need to change the culture.
//Any policy will hit a wall of attitudes if we raise children in the boxes of our own prejudice.
//Let our children make their own choices. Let them choose their own path.
//Cyprus needs worthy men and women to become entrepreneurs.
// It is our duty to help the young and talented to contribute by providing them with the tools to create.
//It is a given that women's entrepreneurship needs the help of the State.
//By strengthening social structures that will facilitate the working woman, the business woman who is both a wife and a mother.
//So as to completely eliminate the choice: career or family.
//It is also the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the individual and collective participation of women in social, political and economic life does not run into rigidities and static and traditional structures of thought.
// But also to anachronistic and outdated prejudices and perceptions.
//We must support women's entrepreneurship by providing the right tools and instruments to help women.
// Already on our initiative and with the support of other political parties, the parliament has passed a legislative proposal for representation of at least one third of each gender on the Boards of Directors of the Semi-State Organizations.
Friends,
Dear guests,
I look forward to your contributions and the debate that will follow and I wish the event every success.
Address by the President of the Democratic Union of Greece Mr. Averof Neophytou at the event of the Think Tank, Political Intervention and Specialization of NEDESY "40 years of Youth of Democratic Union of Greece. Interpreting yesterday, correcting tomorrow "Sunday, 8 May 2016, Conference Hall "Filoxenia", Nicosia, 10:00am.
Honorable Minister of Foreign Affairs, Friend Ioannis Kasoulides
Dear speakers,
//Friends and Friends,
//It is with great joy and pride that I stand with the young people of our party today.
//I feel great pleasure and honour to address a special and select part of the Democratic Rally and society.
//You are actively involved, with the dynamism and enthusiasm that characterizes your youth, in the search for and discussion of solutions and policies.
//You are giving flesh and blood to what I deeply believe in. That our small country has enormous potential and prospects.
//And that the young people of our country have both a vision for their country and an appetite to realize it.
// I congratulate you for proving it with your action!
//Friends and Friends, You have chosen to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Youth of the Democratic Rally with great modesty.
//With a perspective that is deeply relevant and promising.
// Because we need to study yesterday, analyse it and draw conclusions in order to build a better tomorrow.
// To learn and not to repeat past mistakes.
//Friends and friends, On May 22, Cypriot society will be called upon to make a decisive choice: Whether the country will continue with a stable perspective on the path to recovery, addressing unemployment and other challenges of the real economy, or whether it will return to the old practices and mindsets that caused the economic crisis and the deadlocks.
// We must continue on the same path to secure the achievements that belong to the whole of Cypriot society.
// The sacrifices of citizens must not be wasted.
// The mistakes of the recent past must not be repeated.
// Two times six times a wise man is not a wise man.
// Friends, today the seriousness, responsibility and maturity of all is being tested.
// In the Democratic Rally we choose the difficult path of responsibility rather than reverting to the practices that led us to the edge of the cliff.
// We address the citizens in a straightforward manner.
// We are going to these elections with clear positions, with confidence and certainty.
// With faith for the work that the government of Nicos Anastasiades and this party has offered to this country.
// But also with certainty about the perspective that we are reopening for our Cyprus.
// We have not and will not play the game of populism and empty promises.
// So woe betide us if, in the course of the elections, we get carried away by populism and undermine the titanic work of this government and the Democratic Rally.
// Even if some attempt to monopolize social sensitivity
//They forget that in the last 5 years their policies have been paid for first and foremost by the workers.
// They came to power in 2008 with unemployment at 3.6% and shot it up to 15%.
//And now they have the audacity to criticize the policies of austerity that we have been following for the last 3 years. As if they haven't learned from yesterday's mistakes.
// But this austerity has succeeded in limiting public spending, economic growth and reducing unemployment.
//This of course does not satisfy us. The unemployment rate remains high at 12%.
// Tackling unemployment and boosting employment remain top priorities.
// Dear all, I would like to make a reference to the new formations that are appearing and attempting to present themselves as something new and subversive.
//I would like to note that there is absolutely nothing new in these combinations.
//Their leaderships served and were served by all the traditional parties and are made up of the party peddlers and now under a new cloak they present and promote themselves as something new in the political life of the country.
//Friends and Friends, We have always been the party that took on the tough stuff.
//Without fear in the face of the enormous challenges that our country had to face.
//We have achieved the accession of Cyprus to Europe, the greatest victory ever achieved by the Republic of Cyprus with our historic leader, who lifted the kneeling country on its feet, achieving national reconciliation after the national catastrophe of 1974, Glafkos Clerides.
//Today, with Nicos Anastasiades, we are achieving the salvation and the rebirth of our country.
//We are achieving the reversal of the dramatic facts that the previous government and its policies had created.
// Friends, Today we have to defend our policies and ideas.
//The stable perspective of this country.
//This is a course we will not risk.
//On 22 May we participate.
//I am addressing society but especially young people.
//The abstention rewards the practices and attitudes that led the country one step closer to disaster.
// Abstention rewards the artificial yesterday.
//In the upcoming crucial elections, the Cypriot people are called upon to choose.
//And before him he has two choices. The path of a stable perspective. And the other that takes us backwards.
//And it is on the vote of the people that the stable course of the country will depend.
//Every vote has a direct impact on our lives and the course of our country.
//It has an impact on tomorrow.
// Abstinence takes us back.
//A strong Democratic Rally means an even stronger government.
//To strengthen political stability and for the prospect of a better Cyprus.
//Cyprus is its people.
//Cyprus' future is its young people. It is you.
//Come on, let's move forward together!
//To make the vision of a free, united and proud homeland a reality!
//An ambitious country that will take off, leaving no one behind.
//This is our goal. To help each of our fellow citizens, each young person to realize their own dreams.
//This is the Democratic Rally. We are the stable perspective of this country!
//Together, we will take Cyprus forward!
