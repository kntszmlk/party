//In Cyprus, this 22nd of May between: a. Every Cypriot, b. In the Democratic Party, the following are agreed upon:
//We continue to fight for the liberation of our homeland from Turkish occupation,
//for the end of the partition
//and for the achievement, as soon as possible, of a correct, functional, democratic, dignified and sustainable solution of a bizonal, bicommunal federation, with the right content.
//It is absolutely unacceptable and dangerous for us to adopt the view that "we must finally put an end to the Cyprus problem through any solution.
//The point is not to end the Cyprus problem with a bad solution because many years have passed because such a solution will not be bad for 30 or 40 years, but it will be bad forever.
// Those who argue that we should "finally end it through any solution" should look our children and grandchildren in the eye and consider whether it is worth handing them an uncertain and dangerous future, on the grounds that we are tired of it....
//Our primary goal is to reach a solution that will allow Cypriot Hellenism to continue to live and prosper on this island,
//without depriving our Turkish Cypriot compatriots of any right to freedom. //
We consider the continuation of the Republic of Cyprus to be a decisive and necessary condition for a solution;
//it is the Republic of Cyprus that has joined the European Union and the Eurozone, it is the Republic of Cyprus that must continue to exist.
//Because the continuation of the Republic of Cyprus implies the continuation of the existence of Cypriot Hellenism.
//We recommend that the continuation and evolution of the Republic of Cyprus be defined in the first article of the draft solution of the Cyprus problem.
//The solution must include the full and immediate withdrawal of the Turkish occupation army.
//We reject anachronistic guarantees and the existence of interventionist rights.
Social Agreement
//All Cypriot citizens should enjoy the same rights and freedoms as all citizens of the European Union.
//Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will coexist and co-govern in one state, respecting the political equality of the two communities,
// but also with respect for the democratic, individual and collective rights of citizens.
//Turkey, or any other country, will have no role or say in the events and decisions of the Cypriot state.
//All legal owners of the occupied properties should have the first say in their properties and in any case, they should not be deprived of their property.
//The solution must not legitimise the stay of all settlers.
//The energy plans of the Republic of Cyprus to continue, regardless and unaffected by any developments in the Cyprus problem.
//Our Turkish Cypriot compatriots will only be able to enjoy the benefits of the exploitation of natural gas in the Cypriot EEZ after the solution.
//A new strategy of the Greek Cypriot society on the Cyprus problem and a return to the unanimous decisions of the National Council are urgently required,
//which the DISY and AKEL leaderships are currently violating.
//The new strategy should prioritise the protection of the Republic of Cyprus
//and to exploit its three comparative advantages, namely (a) the fact that it is the only recognized state on the island
// (b) the fact that it is a member of the European Union and the Eurozone; and
// (c) the fact that it has hydrocarbon deposits.
/ / / It is necessary to change the tactics of the Greek Cypriot community in the negotiations immediately, i.e., it is necessary to disengage from the Anastasiades-Eroglu Agreement of February 2014,
// the start of a substantive discussion of all chapters of interest to Greek Cypriots, now and not at the end of the process
//and the withdrawal of the unacceptable concessions made unilaterally by Mr Christofias and Mr Anastasiades over the last eight years, without any exchange.
//It is untrue, unacceptable and dangerous to incriminate the Greek Cypriots and blame them for the non-solution of the Cyprus problem,
//disregarding the fact that it is Turkey that invaded Cyprus and it is the old Turkish intransigence that prevents the solution.
Social Agreement
//We condemn the artificial separation of the people and of political figures and parties, between those who "want a solution" and those who "do not want a solution"
//This artificial separation, which is consciously done by the leaderships of DISY and AKEL, is strengthening the efforts for unity among Greek Cypriots
//and disassociating Turkey.
//Our reaction to any attempt to upgrade the occupied pseudo-state must be constant and continuous.
//A necessary condition for preventing such an upgrade is to stop the tolerance or encouragement of the Anastasiades government and the DISY and AKEL leaderships to the visits of foreign officials to the occupied territories.
//For the same reason, the constant advertising and idealisation of the occupation leader Mustafa Akinci, who, unfortunately, is daily contradicting the expectations that existed before he became the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, should be stopped.
//Cypriot Hellenism must be informed about the efforts being made to reach a solution to the Cyprus problem, as well as about everything that is being discussed in the negotiations and which the Turkish side is already aware of;
//The blackout and secret diplomacy on the major national issue concerning the future of the Cypriot people must be ended immediately.
//Transparency and information of citizens are indispensable ingredients for a healthy democracy
//Our main goal and aspiration is the recovery of the real economy
//The termination of the Memorandum is a positive development, to which the Democratic Party has contributed decisively with its attitude and choices. //
Unfortunately, however, the end of the Memorandum has not brought an end to the crisis.
// For this to happen, i.e. for households and small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit substantially, policies and measures that ensure growth must be implemented.
//These are the measures and policies that the Democratic Party has been proposing for the last three years, and to this end the Party reiterates its call to the Government, and to all political parties, for a solution.
//The priority of the State should be the restoration of injustices created due to the crisis,
//especially injustices that affect our economically weaker compatriots.
//It is necessary to review, every six months, the necessity of the laws imposed by the Memorandum and to amend and/or abolish them in cases where this is desirable and feasible.
Social Agreement
//The creation of a Troubled Loan Management Bank is required in order to prevent the sale of Cypriot assets abroad
//and to enhance the ability of banks to provide liquidity to the real economy.
//Only one license for the operation of small and medium-sized enterprises should be introduced
//Incentives for capital repatriation should be introduced.
//We recommend the provision of tax incentives to support enterprises operating in innovative sectors such as IT, modern production methods and energy
//We recommend the creation of a Special Development Fund. This fund would draw investment from the state, private individuals and financial institutions, as well as capital from European funds, and would be able to finance viable businesses in sectors with a significant return on investment.
//We recommend the creation of a Guarantee Mechanism for Small and Medium Enterprises
//We recommend the compensation of "clipped" Cypriot depositors, securities holders, provident funds and pension funds, with 10% of the annual primary surplus for the next 20 years, based on specific criteria (the total amount to about €2 billion).
//We propose a 20% reduction in property tax;
//We propose a tax exemption of up to 5,000 euros for expenses and health insurance;
//To immediately combat unemployment, we propose a reduction in tax rates for small and medium-sized enterprises that create new, additional jobs. The reduction will be in the tax rate and will be graduated. It will start at a 0.5% rate cut for one additional job, rise to 0.25% for each subsequent job and reach 2% for more than five additional jobs
//We propose extending unemployment benefits to 56 weeks.
Social Agreement
//2% of the budget (around €160 million) should be used to create new jobs and retrain the unemployed.
/ / It is necessary to further strengthen the institution of the Auditor General.
/ / It is necessary to apply rules of full transparency in the operation of the Public Service and Local Government.
//We advocate the control of the assets of politicians, senior state officials, senior public officials and mayors by independent auditors in order to determine whether their assets correspond to their declared income and the abolition of the fictitious "pretend assets".
//It is high time to change the way of appointments to the boards of the Semi-State Organizations, with the establishment of a transparent procedure that includes the evaluation of the candidates by an independent committee of experts.
//We advocate the prohibition and criminalisation of the financing of political parties by individuals and businesses.
//We propose the abolition of the immunity of MPs for acts, actions or behaviour unrelated to their legislative or parliamentary duties.
//The Attorney General, the Attorney General, the Auditor General, the Governor General of the Central Bank, to be appointed by the President of the Republic, but their appointment must be approved by the Parliament, to which they must present an annual report on their work.
//We recommend the establishment of a right of legislative initiative for citizens, in order for citizens to be able to submit legislative proposals directly to Parliament, with 5,000 signatures.
//We advocate the establishment of a Citizens' Committee in the Parliament, so that every citizen can raise issues of concern to him/her for discussion.
//We strongly support the continuation and intensification of exploration in the Cypriot EEZ for the discovery, extraction and commercial exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits,
//a process which is an inalienable, sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus and which will strengthen our country politically, strategically and economically.
Social Agreement
//- We support strategic alliances with neighbouring countries, which will make our island a new energy hub in the Eastern Mediterranean.
//- It is necessary to develop a comprehensive plan for the rational management of the exploitation of the deposits.
//The management model should be based on proven and successful examples of countries with experience to ensure further investment in the sector,
//to achieve budget reinforcement
// and to build up a stock for future generations.
//- It is necessary to use cheaper and environmentally cleaner conventional fuels, such as natural gas, as soon as possible, to meet the energy needs of our country.
//This will lead to security of supply and increased competitiveness.
//- It is necessary to expand the use of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy balance, in order to boost the economy and the decoupling from liquid fuels
//and it is necessary to support and promote feasible technologies that ensure greater use of АПΕ, such as storage technologies.
//- Particular emphasis should also be placed on energy saving since the promotion of energy saving technologies and increased efficiency contribute to competition and productivity.
//Further support for the tourism industry is necessary, through a comprehensive plan to upgrade the tourism product and through targeted interventions to attract new tourism markets, such as medical and sports tourism.
//We propose the acceleration and simplification of the procedures for the licensing of tourism businesses and the evaluation of tourism investments, a development that will contribute to the encouragement of the tourism industry,
// to encourage the development of
//and the creation of new jobs.
//We support the further expansion of the network of Citizen Service Centres (KEPs),
//increase the services they provide
//and the strengthening of their staff.
//It is high time that the Electronic Signature is institutionalized in Cyprus as well, in order to significantly reduce the bureaucracy, the delay and the inconvenience that citizens and businesses suffer today.
//The implementation of a modern and, above all, Sustainable General Health Plan (GESY) is a necessary condition in order to achieve the necessary upgrading of the health services provided to all citizens.
// Therefore, we call on the Government to complete the necessary studies and submit the necessary bills to the Parliament as soon as possible.
Social Agreement
// It is necessary to reorganize and to make the State Hospitals autonomous,
// the reorganisation and upgrading of the Primary and Prevention Services.
//We support the establishment of University Clinics through legislation,
// the e-health application,
//the creation of a National Medicines Agency,
//the reorganisation of the Ministry of Health
//and the clarification of the role of the Health Insurance Agency.
//For the continuous upgrading of education and the education provided in Cyprus, it is necessary to support both the public and private education
// as well as private universities,
// The implementation of a programme to create modern building facilities in all levels of education,
// the introduction of a new system of evaluation of educational units and teaching staff,
// the expansion of the institution of Post-secondary Institutes of Vocational Education and Training throughout the country
// and the effective linking of education with real conditions and needs in the labour market.
// Particular emphasis should be placed on strengthening Special Education, both in terms of resources and human resources, in order to provide effective and at the same time human-centred support to people who need special education
// but also to their families.
//We support the empowerment of municipalities with additional powers and resources, as well as the reduction of their number in order to achieve a reduction of equal operating costs.

// while implementing plans to support the owners and residents of these areas.
//We encourage the allocation of gravel land to unemployed people for agricultural or farming work.
//We support a complete ban on uncontrolled quarrying.
// / It is necessary to denounce to the European Union the systematic destruction of the environment in the occupied territories by the illegal works and activities of the Pseudo-state or other trespassers. The most characteristic example of this destruction is the ongoing, uncontrolled quarrying in the Pentadaktylos area.
Social Agreement
