Don't give them your future...
OUR POSITIONS ON CYPRUS
//HEIGHT OF NATIONAL SURVIVAL
//Because not everyone is the same
//RESTORING the Cyprus problem on its proper basis, as a problem of invasion and occupation.
//Turkey is part of the problem, not part of the solution.
//We strongly disagree with the philosophy of the Bi-zonal Bicommunal Federation (B.C.F.F.) on the basis of political equality.
//Contrary to what some people say, the new state, i.e. the Greek Cypriot side, will pay the unbearable cost of the solution.
//Federation in this case is a form of DICHOTOMIZATION, because it is based on a RATIONAL division of the population
//and in ANTI-Democratic processes, uniting the overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots with the minority of Turkish Cypriots.
//We DEMAND the immediate cessation of the talks on the base that are currently taking place
//and the international denunciation of the agreements providing for the TIR,
//because there is a danger that they will lead us to the complete TURNOVATION of our Homeland.
//We DEMAND the immediate closure of the roadblocks.
//It is unacceptable to support financially the occupation of our country.
//We urge the development of a long-term National Strategy for the survival of Cypriot Hellenism
//and the well-being of our people.
//Our GOAL is to maintain the Republic of Cyprus as a UNIFIED and SOVEREIGN state.
//All the political leaderships of the current parliamentary parties bear a huge responsibility for the situation that the Cyprus problem has reached.
//MONADIC and ESSENTIAL resistance to the selling out of our Homeland is the entry of the ELAM into the Parliament.
WHY?
// //EITHER only the E.L.A.M., with its clear positions, can stand in the way of their insidious plans
// and preserve our LANGUAGE, our RELIGION, our HISTORY and our CULTURE.
ECONOMICS

//Reduce the salaries of MPs and political office holders.
//Remove their privileges and party funding.

POLICY

- // EXCLUSION of banking institutions that have received capital support under public guarantee.
- //NATIONAL PROTECTIONISM IN PUBLIC WORKS!
// Use of local materials and not foreign materials where possible
//while encouraging private industry to do the same.

// But he promises a hard fight to get back what we are entitled to and to make Cyprus a self-sufficient and independent country.
