Why the EPP voted against the divestments and voted for the Insolvency Framework
WHAT PROPOSALS WILL BE TABLED IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT
PUBLIC-ACADEMIC-DEMOCRATIC-DEMOCRATIC VOTED FOR THE DIVESTMENTS
//On 6 September 2014, DISY-AKEL-DIKO parties passed the divestment law;
//The EPP voted against it, making it conditional on the simultaneous implementation of a strong insolvency framework to protect borrowers and guarantors.
THEY GAVE THE BANKS SUPER-OPTIONS
//The law passed by DISY-AKEL-DIKO provided that banks could proceed with mass and non-discriminatory divestments from 17 April 2015
//without any protection network for borrowers and guarantors
//Even the most vulnerable groups were faced with the risk of divestment.
WHAT IS THE INSOLVENCY FRAMEWORK
//The insolvency framework is in essence the law of anti-insolvency.
// It is a series of laws that aim to protect citizens against divestment and arbitrary bankruptcies.
// The framework for the protection of citizens was approved by the Parliament on 18 April 2015 with the support of the EPP after all the conditions set by the EPP for strengthening and improving the laws for the benefit of citizens were accepted.
WHOM THE EDICT PROTECTED
//With its persistence and hard negotiation until the last minute, the EPP managed to improve the insolvency framework
// by introducing specific amendments that protect tens of thousands of borrowers and guarantors.
//With the amendments of the EPP: unemployed people and public assistance recipients protected for the first time from the risk of divestment
//Unlawful overcharges and default interest of banks for loan restructurings abolished
//The vast majority of mortgage guarantors were absolutely protected from the possibility of divestment.
WHICH COMMITMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN KEPT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR
//Despite the commitments of both the President of the Republic and the President of DISY from the plenary session of the Parliament, the government claims that it does not accept the Troika
//a. It did not proceed with the adoption of a law for the determination of a single objective value of property,
//b.It did not implement the proposal of the EPP for better protection of guarantors through the equal sharing of the amount due.
HOW THE INSOLVENCY FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
//The implementation of the insolvency framework balanced the risk of mass divestments;
//The framework did not magically solve all the problems caused by the divestment law;
//It is true that it did not progress to the extent it should have done, mainly because the government had not provided in time for the necessary infrastructure in terms of human resources and services.
//The insolvency framework is, however, the only shield of protection that borrowers and guarantors have today against the super-weapon of divestments that DISY-AKEL-DIKO gave to the banks.
THE EDEK SUBMITS TWO PROPOSALS TO THE NEW PARLIAMENT
The EPP will re-submit its proposals to the new Buvi
//I. Determination of a single property value of the mortgage loan, either for loan restructuring purposes, for sale purposes or even for tax purposes;
// By determining a single value of the mortgaged property, all citizens are essentially protected from the risk of devaluation of their property by the banks
// and at the same time additional protection is offered to the guarantors of these loans
; //II. Banks should be obliged to share the guarantors' obligations equally, e.g. in the event of the death or incapacity of a guarantor, the share of the guarantor's liability should not be borne by the other guarantors but should be absorbed by the bank which has the main responsibility for granting the original loan.
ARE THEY FOR THE BANKS or FOR THE CITIZENS?
//The interventions of the EPP in the insolvency framework have created an essential framework of protection for citizens who really need support
//unlike those who wanted either to leave citizens unprotected or to protect banks and big interests or to hide behind cheap populism.
//THOSE WHO VOTED FOR DIVESTMENT WHY DIDN'T THEY VOTE FOR THE PROXIMITY FRAMEWORK?
//together for what unites us
//The Bi-zonal abolishes democracy. We defend its continuity
//The Bi-zonal provides for borders within the country.
// "Zones" within which there are limited basic freedoms, political and human rights.
// The people are divided into "zones" on the basis of ethnic or religious criteria with guaranteed majorities of people and territory.
//The Federation is a constitution in which all citizens enjoy without discrimination the same political and human rights regardless of their origin and residence.
// In the Federation there can be no segregation on the basis of ethnic or religious criteria.
//Conclusion: The term Bi-zonal Bicommunal Federation (BBCF) is misleading and inappropriate.
// Federation cannot coexist with bizonality and even more so when it is bi-communal.
// TLD and political equality are not the same. Therefore we are not talking about a Federation but a Confederation on the basis of ethnic and racial discrimination.
//President Makarios in the 4 points of 1977 had not accepted the IGO but the existence of two regions that would have administrative and not state power.
// Here the basic freedoms would be fully guaranteed.
//For the first time, the IHL was included in UN resolutions under the presidency of G. For the first time ever, the UNO was appointed to the UN under the presidency of Vassiliou with the agreement of the co-governing AKEL and the opposition DISY.
//The EPP with Vassos Lyssarides had strongly disagreed with the acceptance of the term.
// The only case where the IOI was given concrete content was in the Annan plan which our people rejected because it was dichotomous
//and a precursor to the Turkification of our homeland.
//Whose interests does the IHL safeguard, Cyprus's or Turkey's?
//A clear answer to the question is given by: the Turkish policy to date, the statements of Turkish officials (e.g. statements by Mehil Enenbel on 5.8.1974 "Turkey will not accept a solution of a double union or partition because it will not allow a Greek island in the eastern Mediterranean. It seeks a solution of a federation with geographical separation") the Nihat Erimta reports the memoirs of Ismail Tansoulthe book by Ahmet Davutoglu the Turkish proposals to the OSCE mediator Galo Plaza in 1965 the minutes of the meeting in Evros in September 1967
//Turkey's constant objective was and remains the reconquest of Cyprus with the IED as an intermediate stage.
//The Bi-zonal will give Turkey the ability to control the Turkish-occupied part of our homeland
//and through this to control politically and militarily all of Cyprus.
//It is therefore obvious that the TLD as the President of the Republic is discussing it today: it will come from the association of two constituent states
//will include geographical separation on the basis of national origin
// will guarantee a majority population and territorial majority of the respective community
//Crosses political and human rights
//It will not ensure the application of fundamental freedoms to all Cypriots
//will legalize colonization
//will enable Turkey to control the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Senate
//The IOI endangers the national and physical survival of Cypriot Hellenism,
// essentially serving the realization of the Turkish goal of reconquering Cyprus.
//The People must decide who they trust
//and what form of solution he wants
//The next parliamentary elections could be a starting point for: Exploiting the new geostrategic realities that have emerged in the Eastern Mediterranean and the interests involved
//2. Debate on the essence of the Cyprus problem as a matter of invasion and occupation
//3. Withdrawal of the unacceptable concessions by Anastasiades - Christofias.
//4. Use, at last, the political advantages - rights granted to us by the European Union, in which we have forgotten that we are equal partners.
//5. Substantial involvement of the Russian factor and other friendly countries (France, China) in the efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem
//WE ARE FIGHTING FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION
//IN EDEK WE BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE

The EPP proposal for Health Immediate implementation of the GESY
//The long delay in the introduction of the GHS, the economic crisis and the dramatic deterioration of the operation of state hospitals make the simultaneous implementation of all phases of the GHS impossible and extremely dangerous.
//For this reason, the gradual implementation of the GHS is proposed in phases within a specific framework of a timetable of a defined duration.
//The proposed phases of the phased implementation of the GHS include:Introduction of primary care (There is a possibility of implementation on a trial basis for a certain period of time in one province in order to identify and correct any errors or weaknesses and/or shortcomings that may be observed).
//Inclusion of paraclinical and laboratory tests
//Integration of public hospitals
//Introduction of secondary care (inpatient)
//Introduction of tertiary and quaternary care
Introduction of primary care:
//The correct and effective implementation of primary care is the cornerstone of the implementation of the GHS.
//The aim of the immediate introduction of primary care is: The decongestion of the Outpatient Clinics and First Aid Departments of the Hospitals
//by transferring patients to the Private Sector as well
//Restructuring of the Hospitals in order to lead them to self-sufficiency within appropriate conditions
//Upgrading of the Rural Health Centres
//Enhancing preventive medicine through early examination of cases
//and avoiding deterioration of the health status of patients due to delay, which will then require higher recovery costs.
//Thereby long-term savings can be made.
//Public-private partnership.The patient will be able to freely choose a doctor from both the private and the public sector.
METHOD OF APPLICATION AND BENEFITS:
-// The Health Insurance Organisation (HIO) will be responsible for supervision and implementation
-// The patient will be able to freely choose his/her doctor from the private sector as well as from the public sector
- //In the case of choosing a private sector doctor, a visit fee (copayment) will be determined.
//Low pensioners and vulnerable groups will be exempted from paying the fee.
-// The visit will include medication in the first phase.
//In a second phase to include laboratory and paraclinical tests
-// The total amount allocated to cover the services offered will be the amount that the state currently spends on primary care.
-// Establishment of control groups to prevent abuses by health care providers and setting penalties in case of recurrence
-// The state will have additional revenues that will result from the income tax of the health care providers, since for each of them it will be known both the amount they will receive from the state and the additional visit fee (copayment)
-// Regarding medicines, the position adopted by the OAS should be implemented. That is, for each category of medicines, the reimbursement price should be determined.
// If the health care provider wishes to prescribe a drug that is more expensive than the predetermined price then the patient will cover the difference.
//This avoids the removal of medicines from the market
//and at the same time the possibility for both the patient and the health care provider to have a choice of medicine is guaranteed.
-// Finally, we propose the immediate submission to the Parliament for adoption of the updated amendment bill for the GESY, as it has been developed in cooperation with the OAI.
//Low pensioners and vulnerable groups will be exempted from paying the tax
//Together for what unites us
