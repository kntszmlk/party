Statement by AKEL General Secretary A. Kyprianou on agricultural policy
//In conditions of deep economic crisis, the rural economy has an important role to play.
//We all remember the many commitments made to the farmers by the Anastasiades-Assembly Government before and after the elections.
//Unfortunately, however, the farmer was given anything but substantial support.
//The overriding problem at the moment is how to deal effectively with the devastating drought.
//In similar circumstances, in 2009, the Christofias Government supported all agricultural sectors with 67.5 million euros.
//Today, when the problem is even more acute, the procedures of the Agricultural Insurance Agency need to be accelerated and reinforced with additional government support.
//AkEL is in constant contact with the farmers.
// We listen to their problems and formulate proposals to address the difficulties they face.
// We propose among others the following measures: Conduct a scientific and comprehensive study to analyze the reasons and factors that led the Agricultural Economy to its current situation.
//Focusing the Development Programmes of the Rural Economy on regional development.
//Using Research, Education and Innovation as tools to support the Rural Economy.
// Lifting of taxation for all agricultural land.
//Stopping the sale of the agricultural - livestock related commercial shops and infrastructure of the Co-operative.
//Study on Financing and supply of agricultural inputs after the loss of the role played by the Co-operative.
//Policy to combat obscenity in pesticides and veterinary medicines.
//Today, the need for cooperative organizations at the service of the farmer, which will be a tool and lever to support his income, is more acute than ever.
//At this moment Cypriot farmers feel at the mercy of austerity policies, poverty, modern usury and dispossession.
//We need comprehensive and substantial support, not big false words and false commitments.
Press Conference of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of AKEL, Andros Kyprianou
Seven proposals and actions for the fight against corruption and corruption and the progressive modernisation of institutions
//Today, more than ever before, society demands that the phenomena of interference and corruption be addressed;
//It requires consolidation and institutional modernization;
//The phenomena of interference and corruption have as victims the ordinary citizen who pays increased costs while at the same time reasonably seeks transparency and justice;
//We have a responsibility as political parties to promote the consolidation of meritocracy, transparency and accountability.
// There is a need to strengthen the mechanisms of control and prevention, as well as those of crackdown and punishment.
// We must work intensively and decisively now.
// Together with the citizens who want a better Cyprus.
// But because the citizen expects that we should start transparency and accountability at home, we have already implemented or will promote the following.
Initiatives concerning AKEL:
//Voluntary disclosure of the whereabouts of the members of the P.G. of AKEL, the members of our Parliamentary Group, MEPs and former government officials who are Party officials;
//Personally, I have long since disclosed my and my wife's assets;
//Prompt and timely delivery to the Registrar of Political Parties of the annual audited accounts of the K.
//Publication and posting on the official website of the Party;
//Full implementation of the improved law on the financing of political parties by AKEL, particularly in the issues of compliance with international accounting standards and promotion of transparency;
//Discussion of the Party's financial statements in the presence of the media at our respective conferences.
Transparency and modernisation proposals:
//AkEL has elaborated and submitted to the public debate a significant number of proposals for fighting corruption and corruption //as
well as for institutional modernisation.
//The main proposals are the following: Institutional regulation of term limits in various state offices
//and rotation in key positions in the Civil Service;
//Modernization of the legal framework governing the National Guard's tenders and purchases of armaments;
//Possibility of public scrutiny of all tenders awarded in the public and semi-public sector, regardless of the amount.
//Legislative regulation of the financial activities of non-governmental organisations with a view to ensuring transparency in their financing.
//Publication of audited accounts of the media, both print and electronic, while informing the public about the beneficial owners, including subsidiaries and affiliated companies.
// Mandatory confiscation of property of state officials and public servants convicted of economic crimes, in particular tax evasion, bribery, corruption and misappropriation of public funds.
//Legislative regulation of stricter penalties so that the consequences of any offences committed against the State are a deterrent to their commission;
//Improving citizen accessibility to the authorities, particularly in terms of securing public documents, service and transparency in relation to decisions affecting them, through public hearings and accountability.
On the Cyprus problem and its resolution
A policy of principles, responsibility and assertiveness
// AKEL considers the achievement of a solution to the Cyprus problem of crucial importance for the present and the future of the country.
//The de facto partition and the presence of thousands of Turkish occupation troops are a source of danger for the country and our people.
//The Cyprus problem must be resolved as soon as possible because time is working against the solution. This does not mean that we are in favour of any solution.
//Each other. For us the solution has specific specifications and content.
//We are consistently and continuously fighting for a solution based on the 1977 and '79 High Level Agreements, the relevant UN resolutions, international and European law.
//It is our non-negotiable position that the solution must liberate our country, end the Turkish occupation and colonization.
//We are fighting for a solution that reunites the land and the people, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians and Latins in the framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal state with one, single and indivisible sovereignty, one citizenship and one international personality.
//The solution must ensure the continuity of the Republic of Cyprus and the evolution of its political structure into a bi-communal bizonal federation with political equality as described in the relevant UN resolutions.
//It is also our non-negotiable position that the solution must safeguard the human rights and basic freedoms of all the people.
// This extremely important goal was fleshed out with the convergence achieved by Christofias and Talat for the exercise of basic freedoms by all Cypriots without any restrictions.
// At the same time, the convergences impose restrictions on the descent of Turkish citizens in a way that safeguards the demographic structure of the Cypriot people.
//The solution must ensure the demilitarization of the Cypriot state,
// which will create the conditions in the future for the abolition of British military bases.
//The internal aspects of the Cyprus problem will be resolved through intercommunal dialogue.
// The international aspects of the Cyprus problem (security, guarantees, settlement, settlement, withdrawal of Turkish troops) will be agreed in the framework of a representative international conference under the auspices of the UN, which will be convened when the two sides are within the range of agreement on the internal aspects.
The present phase
//Today the negotiations are at a difficult turning point, as the two sides have not yet managed to overcome their disagreements on the property issue,
// while a number of convergences reached between Christofias and Talat have not yet been reconfirmed.
//The course of the negotiations vindicates the position AKEL has publicly expressed many times on how Mr Anastasiades should manage the negotiation process.
//We took the position that the President should continue the negotiations from where they left off mainly with the Christofias-Talat convergences and at the same time ask for the reconfirmation of the convergences.
//Unfortunately, we were not listened to and the President wasted time discussing from a zero base, resulting in the Greek Cypriot side being accused of intransigence and political losses.
//It is no coincidence that at that time the UN Secretary General submitted to the Security Council the worst report since 2004 on our side.
// After this development, Anastasiades was forced to adopt Christofias-Talat convergences, which allowed progress to be made.
What is our position on developments
//In the phase we are in today, negotiations must continue.
// Only through negotiations can the disagreements on the property issue, which is the main chapter of discussion, be overcome,
//and move on to discuss the chapters on territorial adjustments, security and guarantees to which Turkey directly has to be held accountable.
//This will reveal Turkey's true intentions and intentions regarding the Cyprus solution.
//If Turkey decides to move towards a solution, then the Cyprus problem will be resolved.
//If not, then it should be clear to the international community that Turkey is responsible for the non-solution.
// And once she is in charge, it will not be easy for her to attempt to upgrade the pseudo-state.
//Akel, as always, will continue to support efforts to reach a solution with seriousness and responsibility.
//For AKEL, a solution to the Cyprus problem means reaching an honourable compromise with our Turkish Cypriot compatriots.
// No compromise with possession or with any third party.
// AKEL has its positions and is guided by them.
//Always working in the interest of the country and our people.
Statements by the General Secretary of AKEL, at the press conference on the economy
//The developments in society and the economy in the last three years are very different from what we were used to in the past.
//The economy of the country has changed violently since March 2013.
//Society is experiencing insecurity and the incomes of the many have been reduced for the benefit of the few.
//To address current inequalities, a change in economic policy is needed.
//We need to end the philosophy of bloody austerity.
//We need development policies that restore the welfare state and improve the living standards of workers and vulnerable groups of the population.
//We want the operation of a modern state, in which economic growth and social welfare will be in harmony.
//Our economic philosophy is people-centred and based on the following principles: The promotion of public investment aimed at developing the economy
//and improving disposable income for the whole of society.
//The promotion of tax policies aimed at a fairer redistribution of national income, the fight against poverty and social exclusion and the support of socially vulnerable groups of the population.
//The distribution of economic burdens according to the income and the economic status of each individual.
//The creation of a humane and socially sensitive state, which protects and supports the economically vulnerable layers of society.
//Trimming public finances and effectively combating tax evasion in order to free up resources for growth and social cohesion.
//The preservation of the social character of public utilities and their direct renting, restructuring and modernization, in order to operate more efficiently and become arms of development and further strengthening of the state's finances.
//The formulation of a single national housing policy.
// Cutting spending on housing policy, particularly in relation to refugees, limits the possibilities of obtaining housing for a large part of the population.
//Introduce measures and policies to alleviate the burden of over-indebted households and small and medium-sized enterprises.
//Measures to reduce financing costs, eliminate abusive charges and protect the right to housing.
//Defending social character in the fields of Health, Education, Sport and Culture.
//On 22 May citizens can make a difference
ANNEX
//At the parliamentary level, AKEL defended the interests of the workers and the Cypriot people;
//We fought to protect the main house and the small professional house from being sold off with a loan of up to 350 thousand euros.
//We put forward concrete proposals to improve the chaos caused by the social policy reform and the implementation of the Minimum Guaranteed Income;
//We proposed a radical revision of the property tax rates in order to restore a fairer and more balanced distribution of the burden.
//We have submitted a Proposal for a Law with which we wanted to control the Minister of Labour in issuing orders on the issue of shop opening hours.
//We have submitted a Proposal for a Law on the extension of Collective Agreements.
//We fought to save public wealth;
//We tabled a Bill to suspend the application of the Privatisation Law until 2017.
//We tabled an amendment to safeguard Occupational Pension Funds, including Provident Funds and Pension Funds
//We tabled a proposal for a law aimed at protecting the labour rights of people absent on sick leave
AKEL proposals for Education and Culture
//The crisis that the country is going through today is not only an economic crisis. It is a crisis of institutions, values and priorities.
// The role of Education and Culture in addressing the crisis is crucial.
// We need a more qualitative, democratic and human-centred education.
// For three years now, those in power have been pushing things backwards with an anti-education reform: more conservative, more authoritarian education, mainly at the expense of the popular strata.
//The new parliamentary group of AKEL-Left-New Forces will work for the implementation of the following measures: the change of the Integrated Lyceum was a right move but the new timetable has serious weaknesses and is inadequate.
//We advocate the adoption of the 40-hour program in high schools.
//The additional cost of 10-12 million per year to come from savings in the Ministry of Culture's budget of about 1 billion.
//Conversion of all contract and temporary teachers who have completed 30 months of service to permanent employees.
//Despite the persistent disagreement of the rulers, after the recent decision of the Labour Court, there is no other way. Gradual tenure.
//With the assumption of the Anastasiades government, hundreds of teachers who were working in the afternoon and evening classes were transformed overnight from being employees of IDABEP to self-employed with a Market of Services.
//Hundreds of teachers, mostly young people, lost up to 35% of their incomes.
//These people, who are currently employed illegally, must be rehabilitated.
//Expansion of Technical Education, which the country needs and is in increased demand, with the immediate construction of a new Technical School in Larnaca and 3 regional schools in the other provinces for the needs of the countryside.
//Restructuring of special education on the basis of the integrated proposal submitted by AKEL to the Ministry of Culture and Education, with emphasis on the employment of people with disabilities after the age of 21, the revision of legislation and the strengthening of special schools and special units.
//Radical reform of Evening Lyceums and Evening Technical Schools, with new timetables, new curricula and specialization in teaching adults.
//Expansion of the institutions of Post-secondary Institutions of Vocational Education and Training, by one department in all provinces.
// Consolidation of the MIEEKs and student sponsorship to their students.
/ / Strengthening the IPE, which lacks the necessary funds to support research and innovation.
/ / Strengthening of Universities to make use of the many young, brilliant scientists we have, with parallel benefits for the economy.
//Mapping of research infrastructure and direct access to research laboratories for all researchers.
//Increasing the totally insufficient number of educational psychologists to deal with school delinquency
//but also the social and psychological problems of children and young people in our schools.
//Support for the State Student Welfare, which has been hit after the recent cut in funding by the government.
// It is unacceptable for a state that gives 1 billion for education to force students to interrupt their studies.
//Defending the public character of the state universities, since recently there have been increasing calls for their "liberalization" and the loss of their public character.
//The cultural sector is the big victim of government policy.
// With the assumption of government by Mr. Anastasiades, the budget for culture was reduced by 25%.
// It has gradually come back due to funds for Pafos 17, but the reality is that much less money is invested in the arts and creatives.
//We should immediately: proceed with infrastructure projects for culture, such as the state museum, the library, the state gallery, which apart from contributing to cultural development will enhance the tourist product and help in the real development of the economy.
//Despite the announcements of the Deputy Ministry of Culture and the burial of the Unified Authority for Culture, the creation of a central cultural authority is still an issue.
//AKEL will take initiatives in this direction. Legislative initiatives to fill legislative gaps such as the operation of various schools.
//Expansion of the institution of "cultural networks", according to geographical criteria and by art form.
//Supporting creators, especially young creators, with additional funds.
//Enhancing amateur creativity.
//Utilization of technology for the digitization of our cultural heritage and for the dissemination of arts and culture with the modern means offered
//Increase in the funds offered to "free theatres" since more theatres today share the same money than in the past.
// AKEL will continue to defend the labour rights of actors, directors, set designers, stage designers, musicians and those involved in theatre and the arts in general.
Statement by AKEL General Secretary A. Kyprianou
AKEL proposes specific immediate measures to reduce income inequality
//One of the most dramatic results of the policies of the Anastasiades-DISY government is that they have made Cypriot society one of the most unequal in Europe.
// In fact, we have the highest rate of increase in the gap between the rich few and everyone else.
//90% of Cypriots saw their incomes drastically decrease, while 10% of the richest saw their incomes increase.
//In short, in the 3 years of Mr.Anastasiades' and Mr.Averof Neophytou's government, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer.
//There can be no sustained economic recovery without a reduction in economic inequality.
//Inequality hurts the economy. It limits the purchasing power of the middle and popular classes.
//Increasing inequality harms society. It creates insecurity and anxiety.
// It destroys the social fabric and shrinks the middle class.
//Victims of the policies implemented are workers, the unemployed, pensioners, farmers, young people, large families, single parents, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.
//All those whom Mr Anastasiades had pledged to protect.
//AkEL's effort is to protect those in need.
// This is the aim of every proposal, every position and every initiative we take.
//There are ways to address the situation and reduce economic inequality by redistributing national wealth.
// I stress this because every time we propose a step in this direction, the Government and DISY are breaking their clothes that the economy of the country will be destroyed.
//But when it comes to their own policies that protect the banks or the chosen few, then everything is easy and convenient. There's no harm, no foul.
// AKEL proposes and supports policies that benefit the many and not a small elite.
//Proposes specific measures. Measures concerning specific groups of the population.
//They aim to reduce poverty and inequality.
// These measures can be implemented without delay.
//Measures to protect workers' incomes: setting binding basic conditions of employment. Conditions such as wages, compulsory holidays, overtime compensation, the 13th salary.
//Ending the conversion of salaried workers into self-employed.
//Legislative regulation of wage employment.
//Measures to support vulnerable groups:Change the income criteria for child benefit and student sponsorship, as regards the increase of dependent children, so that the number of children is taken into account.
//Development of a special plan of financial support for low-income young couples and unemployed couples who intend to start a family, providing for rent subsidies, purchase of household appliances, etc.
//Revise the Law on Minimum Guaranteed Income as follows: Revision of the method of calculation - assessment of elderly care.
//Specialisation of financial support policies for people with disabilities in specific legislation and not in the framework of the E.E.U. law.
//Settlement for those single parents who do not proceed to divorce for objective reasons
//and limiting the calculation of maintenance as income.
//Substantial increase in the amount of property that will not be taken into account for the long-term unemployed.
//We have not remembered all this now that we have elections.
//I say this because some people suddenly remembered to show a pro-people face to society, while in Parliament they were voting for a bunch of unpopular measures.
//AkEL has submitted specific proposals to the Parliament over the past years for the protection of workers and vulnerable groups.
//I recall some of the most important ones:  Proposal for equal and decent treatment of workers by employers through collective agreements.
//Proposal to protect workers who are absent from work for a long period of time due to very serious illness and to prevent their illegal dismissal.
//I note with regret that while it was passed unanimously by the Parliament, President Anastasiades has repealed the law.
//Proposals for the protection of the main residence and the small business house and for the protection of loans up to 350 thousand euros, which again concerned the main residence and the small business house so that they could not be sold to foreign investment funds.
//Proposal to protect property buyers from insolvent land developers.
//Proposal for the amendment of the legislation concerning the taxation of immovable property.
//This tax should be imposed on a graduated basis, excluding small properties (30k at 1980 prices as currently in law),
//as well as the exclusion of agricultural land of the same value.
//This proposal was repeated in the plenary session of the Parliament without, unfortunately, the rest of the political forces supporting it.
//Proposals to amend the legislation on child benefit and minimum guaranteed income.
Statement by AKEL General Secretary Andros Kyprianou on the Cyprus problem
//Not everyone may agree with AKEL's analysis of society and the economy. This is perfectly normal.
//But there is no objective person who does not admit that AKEL's policy on the Cyprus problem is consistent and patriotic.
//With a timeless policy that is confirmed every time by developments.
//We have a vision for the Cyprus of the future.
//A vision that we not only believe in, but that we claim.
// A vision that we fleshed out with concrete proposals that we put on the negotiating table.
// Proposals that abolish ethnic confrontation, break down the barriers that wanted us to live side by side and talk about the Cyprus of tomorrow where Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will live together.
//We want to build together with our Turkish Cypriot compatriots the reunited Cyprus within the framework of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation with political equality, as outlined in the UN resolutions.
//A reunified state, which will be a development of the Republic of Cyprus and which will have one and indivisible sovereignty, one citizenship and one international personality.
//A state that will be a beacon and an example for the whole world.
//It will be a modern model of harmonious coexistence between two communities of different nationalities, languages and religions, co-administering their common state.
//It will be a country that will have managed to expel the armies
// and will channel all its strengths and resources into social investment and economic development.
//From September 2009 until the Anastasiades-Eroglu Joint Declaration in February 2014, all the other political forces were united against us on the Cyprus problem.
//We defied the political cost and insisted to the end on our position that the negotiating process should continue from where it had left off with the Christofias-Talat convergences.
//In the beginning we were not listened to and the President followed a policy of rejecting convergences.
// A policy that was preferred by everyone except AKEL.
// That policy collapsed, with Barbaros roaming the southern coast
//and the UN Secretary General to submit the worst report to the Security Council since 2004.
//When Eroglu realized that the President was rejecting the convergences, he did a 180 degree turn, declaring that he was now ready to continue the negotiation from where he had left off.
/ / / In other words, he successfully applied the well-known blame game.
//So when some people talk about DISAKEL they are just misleading the people.
//Because President Anastasiades first followed their policy of the so-called hard line and rejection in word and deed.
//We all saw where their policies have led us.
//When President Anastasiades finally decided to change course and make use of the convergences, progress was finally made.
//This was also helped by the emergence of Acckıkıkınci as the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, since he too stated that he wanted to continue the negotiations from where we were.
//The current context for a solution to the Cyprus problem still exists because it has to do with the interests of both the European Union and Turkey itself.
//However, the recent events with the new "government" in the occupied territories, the removal of Davutoglu and others, prove how correct AKEL's position is that circumstances come and go and must be exploited because one never knows if and when the next one will come.
//The following months will be extremely crucial for the fate of the current negotiation process.
//AkEL has supported the negotiation process from the very first moment.
//We stressed that we are not going to take the country by the throat as DISY and the other parties did under the Christofias government.
//Because we do not act either vindictively or opportunistically.
// We have supported and continue to support the negotiations without, of course, giving a blank cheque.
// No one should take AKEL for granted.
//We have been vindicated by developments.
//But the issue is to do justice to Cyprus and our people.
//This is our first and unshakeable goal.
//We are the force that can make it happen, leading to a solution that is acceptable to both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
//We are the force, the only force that can build and guarantee the perspective of our people, the perspective of liberation and reunification of our country and our people.
Statements by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of AKEL, Andros Kyprianou, at a press conference on the situation in the health sector
23 March 2016
//AkEL is deeply concerned and concerned by the situation in the health sector;
//health is underfunded,
//the public sector is deteriorating and is plagued by a number of problems,
//while the prospect of implementing the General Health System appears bleak.
//We wish to contribute with positions and proposals and submit this memorandum.
//We are ready for further exchange of views if you consider it appropriate.
AKEL's main positions on Health
//Health is a social good.
//It is a right that a self-respecting state has an obligation to provide to its citizens.
//For a modern state, the way it is managed and the level of the citizens' relationship with it, signifies the level of social justice and the culture of society.
//Health care is not a commodity but a social good that must be provided on the basis of comprehensive social planning.
//This implies: Universality and equality of access to health care services
//High level of quality health care services for all
//Dignified treatment of patients
//Social solidarity and fairness in financing
//Support for public hospitals that will be the backbone of the GHS
//Independence of the Health Insurance Agency to ensure good governance, separation of powers, and shielding from political interference in the management of the fund.
//Enhanced protection from opacity and corruption
Current situation in the health sector - findings
//The health sector in Cyprus is unfortunately collapsing and the need for a comprehensive reform in a way that does not turn the right to health into a privilege is urgent and immediate.
// What characterizes the health sector in our country today? Lack of universal coverage and equal access to quality health services;
//Cyprus is the only country in the European Union that does not have a General Health Plan;
//Health expenditure in our country is only 5.5% compared to 15% in the European Union and 14.8% in the Eurozone.
//Health budgets have fallen by more than €185 million in the last 3 years;
// In addition, the revenue from the 1.5% contribution of civil servants and the €23 million collected from hospital fees per year have not been used for health.
//Excessive workload, low morale, lower incomes and frustration are driving doctors and nurses out of public hospitals;
//Waiting lists, queues, shortages of medicines and consumables and other serious daily operational problems are now the order of the day.
//There is no coordination between the public and private sectors, resulting in duplication of infrastructure and waste of resources,
//while much of the private sector, due to the economic crisis, the cost of health care and the further shift of citizens to public hospitals, remains unused and is heading for collapse.
The government's policy
//The government has followed in recent years a delaying policy for the implementation of the health care system as designed, despite the fact that: a) the GESY has been discussed and agreed upon by all political forces and social partners since 2012, b) it has been studied by leading specialized firms abroad, c) its costing and sustainability assessment has been carried out only recently based on economic assumptions agreed upon by the government and the Troika, and d) the Troika has accepted it as viable and necessary.
//The only negotiation that seems to have been made for the Memorandum is the suspension of the implementation and/or change of the content of the GESY towards the promotion of a multi-insurance Health Plan.
//Something like this would increase the cost of implementing the Plan by about 30% or €300 million,
//while at the same time creating patients of different speeds, depending on their financial capacity.
//The government has delivered a comprehensive design for the GESY at a cost acceptable to all social actors and with an implementation timetable by the end of 2015.
//Instead, for the last three years, it has presented a new proposal every year.
// It is obvious that the government has no real planning but is improvising for the GESY.
//The government's policy has caused job insecurity, wage cuts, a chase of civil servants including doctors, uncertainty about the future, excessive workload, disorganization and chaos which leads a large number of doctors to leave the public sector and resort to the private sector.
//At the same time, the freezing of promotion positions has dissolved the hierarchy in several departments, resulting in administrative chaos.
//The government's actions lead to the weakening of the public health sector so that it cannot play the role it deserves in the context of the PPA.
//Directly but clearly patients will be directed to private hospitals and insurance companies.
//Public hospitals will continue to serve the poor, the unemployed and foreigners.
// The Government also insists that the full autonomy of public hospitals is a prerequisite for the implementation of the GESY.
// AKEL supports the autonomy or restructuring of public hospitals.
//But it matters how this is to be pursued. We insist that their public character, and not only their public character, must be preserved.
//The complete autonomy of hospitals is a tried and tested recipe that has been disastrous.
//The Thatcherite axe to the British National Health Service began precisely under the slogan of "autonomy" and "competition" as part of a "healthy market".
//But it is about "autonomy" in the management of austerity where what is not "sustainable" will be cut or outsourced.
// This introduces the logic of "competition" in an area where cooperation and coordination are a prerequisite.
//In terms of providing patients' universal right to health care, this is disastrous: It forces each hospital separately to manage its resources independently of the different needs.
//If it "exceeds" the budget it is forced to cut necessary services.
//Hiring managers who have nothing to do with health, or forcing doctors to become "managers" who put the "microeconomics of small business" above the universal right to health of patients.
//Even from a strictly economic point of view, this is completely unsustainable, because it undermines "economies of scale", the advantages of a massive single "market" in a health system that requires massive and continuous investment, synergies and avoidance of wasteful duplication of resources.
//It is a doctrine that serves an ideology and economic interests that want the privatization of health care.
//The GESY can be implemented without the full autonomy of public hospitals.
// In most countries where health care systems are in place, there are public/state-run hospitals.
//What is really needed is a reorganization of public hospitals (administrative, financial and scientific) to make them more efficient and competitive.
//This administrative reorganisation can also give relative or enhanced autonomy, where synergies, economies of scale, overlapping, complementarity, etc. can be exploited.
AKEL's positions on the autonomy and reorganisation of public hospitals and public health
//Basic principles that should govern state hospitals after autonomy or restructuring. Theowner should be the state;
//The hospitals should be a non-profit organization, socially beneficial, financially independent and self-sustaining;
//Any potential profits should be invested back into health;
//The autonomy - reorganization of the hospitals can be done through administrative and financial autonomy.
//By creating a strong and independent department in the Ministry of Health, under which all public hospitals will be integrated;
//Each of them must be fully financially self-managed, i.e. have their own budget and management.
Characteristics of autonomy
//Each hospital should be able to cost all their services and prepare a global budget.
//To be given the opportunity to upgrade its services through a flexible recruitment system with satisfactory salaries, clear, decent and homogeneous terms of employment.
//Public hospitals to remain within the state apparatus but to become financially self-governing like all departments of the government.
//To decide on a clear structure to staff them with the necessary number of doctors and paramedical staff.
//The interconnection decided in 2012 addresses the fragmentation of services and creates a single infrastructure that complements each other.
//Secure labour relations and vested rights. It is considered the most difficult issue in terms of autonomy.
//Recruitment can be done under special contracts, but with clear terms of employment.
//Existing doctors will continue to work under the present system but the promotion of doctors, whether they are called civil servants (existing) or contracted (contract) doctors, will follow the same procedures and will have the same obligations and responsibilities.
//The status and the way of advancement of the new-entry nurses as well as the process of their advancement should be discussed with the nurses.
//The current procedure for the recruitment of temporary nurses should be reviewed because it is probably not the most meritocratic.
//The autonomy of decision-making should be given.
//To create, with immediate decisions, scientific councils and advisory committees within the hospitals.
//The hospital management team needs to be strengthened.
// Its director should be the legally responsible for the operation of the entire hospital.
//Each clinic will have its own internal budget which will be monitored by each clinic director.
//This will approve all internal billing of consumables from the central warehouses.
//To implement a modern structure in the administration. This will provide flexibility in decision making and adaptability to the constant changes in society and medical affairs (recruitment, incentives, setting targets for productivity increase, purchase of technology, internal control, use of budgets when and where necessary, computerisation, staff security and insurance, staff releases, research).
//Institute internal and external control mechanisms.
// There must be control mechanisms for good administration and avoidance of irregularities.
// Provide a special budget for continuous education - training for all staff without exception.
//There should be an annual budget and 5-year planning.
//The deposit of the budget to be made by the hospital.
//An annual financial audit by an independent state mechanism.
//To establish minimum acceptable levels of health care provision
// Exercise systematic quality control of the implementation of these levels.
//To introduce the institution of research in hospitals.
//Promote cooperation between hospitals (purchase of drugs, tools, consumables, technology, exchange of scientific knowledge/treatments, coverage of hospitals with all specialties).
//There should be a salary adjustment and incentives.
//Use donations but always under strict control.
AKEL's positions on cancer
//Implementation of the National Cancer Strategy Plan prepared under the Christofias administration and approved by the House of Representatives;
//Decision and planning for the operation of radiotherapy centres at the Nicosia and Limassol General Hospitals. Implemented under DX
//Cancellation of the establishment of radiotherapy centres leads to a monopoly in cancer services, which is dangerous in a PSC conditions
//There is a risk that not all patients will be covered
//This decision of the Anastasiades Government cancelled years of planning contrary to the guidelines of the National Committee for the fight against cancer and the European guidelines for radiotherapy.
School of Medicine
//Real support and creation of all necessary infrastructures of the Medical School is required
//To promote an agreement for the creation of university clinics.
AKEL's specific proposals for health
//The Government should proceed immediately to the submission and adoption of the legislative framework for the implementation of the GESY as it has been designed, unanimously adopted and agreed upon with a broad social consensus.
//Return health funding to 2011 levels with the exception of the budget for sending patients abroad.
//The amounts collected from the hospital fees in public hospitals and the contributions of public employees to be reinvested back into public health.
//We need a real increase in the health budget, to finally start a people-centred, not financial, reform.
//Have an honest dialogue with the opposition and health care providers.
//It should be guided by the public interest and equal quality health care for all citizens.
//To strengthen the independence and control of the Health Insurance Organisation (HIO) to ensure good administration, the separation of powers, and to protect it from phenomena of opacity and corruption and from political interference in the management of the fund.
//Public hospitals should be strengthened to form the backbone of the GESY.
//There is no doubt that the state hospitals need functional reorganization (administrative, financial and scientific), modernization and strengthening of the transparency of their procedures so that flexibility in decision-making and implementation is provided through a system that will ensure the provision of quality health care.
//Decide and define a structure for public hospitals. Defrost positions, and restore temporary staff with permanent appointments.
//Fill the positions of Directors and Assistant Directors for better operation of the departments.
// All the vacant posts should be defrosted and filled immediately.
//Waiting lists on a nationwide basis for each category of diseases and in each hospital separately.
//The severity of the various incidents should be recorded in order to rank them according to their priority.
//Promote the creation of radiotherapy centres at the Nicosia and Limassol General Hospital.
//Expand the overtime program to reduce waiting lists.
//There should be a continuous subsidy for patients with neurological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis) for MRI examinations (using the "running contract" method with private centres)
// Provide new approved, specialised pharmaceutical products (especially for patients with neurological diseases, hepatitis C, thalassaemia and cancer) based on modern, scientific protocols.
//Upgrade the salary scales of health professionals to 2011 levels.
//Incentives for overtime work.
//To create reference centres
//and develop a national strategy for each patient group.
//To develop and create new clinics - neurology, rheumatology, infectious diseases, radiotherapy, ICU in all hospitals, trauma, neuroradiology, interventional radiology
//Poor management, untimely updating and the lack of a single electronic record makes waiting lists variable.
// Immediate measures should be taken to reduce waiting lists such as: Create a centralised electronic waiting list system.
//Regular review of patients by their treating physicians.
//Regular updating of waiting lists and their continuous monitoring.
//Publication of waiting lists with respect to personal data so that there is transparency.
/ / / Implementation of clinical protocols to avoid unnecessary referrals for diagnostic tests.
//Appoint clinical pharmacists in hospitals. The presence of at least one in each hospital is necessary
//Design a comprehensive educational policy for health professionals based on the programme of continuing education for health professionals (conferences, short and long term scholarships).
//Akel on health issues, as on the Cyprus issue and on all issues concerning the everyday life of the citizen, has repeated many times and has proven that it will support the Government's efforts in the right framework, namely equality of access and a high level of health services for all citizens.
// Creatively and dynamically we will claim what is a right: equal quality health care for all citizens.
FOR SUPPORT TO THE REFUGEE WORLD
ACKEL LEFT NEW FORCES
Support to the refugee world
//Dealing with the problems of the refugee world has always been AKEL's priority.
//Under the government of D. Christofias, a policy of substantial support for the refugee world and improvement of their living conditions was implemented.
//The government of Anastasiades - DISY brought a negative reversal in the policy of support for refugees.
//Many programmes have been abolished and the criteria have been set according to the logic of exclusion and reduction of the number of beneficiaries.
//Comparisons between the Christofias and Anastasiades governments are
insufficientlyThe Christofias government increased grants to refugee beneficiaries by 130-200%;
//The Anastasiades-Syriarchy government reduced grants to pre-Christofias levels, while introducing strict income criteria;
//To date, it has revised downwards twice the grants and criteria (April and November 2013);
///2. The Christofias government has increased the funds for housing policy up to €140 million
//The budget of the Anastasiades-Syriarchy government this year provides only €56 million for housing projects for refugees
//3. The Christofias government granted over 11000 property titles and more than 2000 lease certificates;
//Gave 579 compensatory plots of land to refugees living in T/C houses who cannot obtain property titles;
//Included for the first time maternal refugees in housing schemes, making a start towards a final solution to the issue.
//The government of Anastasiades - Synagerimos has abolished the plan for the construction and concession of government housing and the plan for the division and concession of land.
//The government is stalling the implementation of the compensation land concession scheme;
///4. The Christofias government has allocated over €120 million for reconstruction and repair of refugee settlements;
//The Anastasiades-Syriades government has drastically reduced funds, leaving already ageing settlements to decay and decay;
//In addition, it has suspended or cancelled projects of the Central Body for Equal Burden Sharing.
AKEL's proposals:
In order to strengthen refugee policy, AKEL proposes, among other measures:
//1. Return the income criteria as they were before April 2013,
// as well as the table concerning the number of bedrooms for which financial assistance is provided.
//2. To bring back the housing plans relating to the division of government land and the construction of government housing estates.
//3. To carry out general and not partial maintenance of the apartment buildings in the refugee settlements, in order to immediately address the problems that endanger the safety and health of the residents.
//4. To complete the separation of all the plots of land that had been granted in previous years.
//5. To end the delay in the process of issuing leasehold certificates and title deeds.
//6. Immediately proceed with the installation of elevators in all apartment buildings in the refugee settlements.
//7. Benefit from the reduction in interest rates for mortgage and business loans, the borrowers and not the Central Equalisation Agency.
//8. The plans for the granting of loans by KFIKB with a State guarantee should be reintroduced immediately.
//9. Delete the time limitation so that the granting of loans by the CFICB for substantial improvements and additions or conversions to owner-occupied primary residences also covers special cases of housing units regardless of age.
//On May 22nd AKEL Left New Forces
//YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
FORWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST INEQUALITY
OUR COUNTRY IS BECOMING DRAMATICALLY MORE UNEQUAL
//A very negative and dangerous development of recent years in our country is the increased income and economic inequality.
//The average citizen feels that Cyprus has become a society of contrasts and extreme differences between the world of work and the world of wealth.
//Daily reality in the years of austerity policies is characterized by unprecedented levels of unemployment, huge reductions in wages and working conditions
//and shrinking of the welfare state.
// The deterioration of the relevant statistics is dramatic and as a result Cyprus has gone from a "middle class" society to levels of inequality a few years ago.
//Official statistics show that Cyprus has the worst performance in terms of increasing income inequality.
//In fact, we are now the most unequal country in the entire European Union with the exception of two Baltic countries, countries where public wealth was distributed to a small elite after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
INEQUALITY HARMS OUR CYPRUS
Inequality hurts the economy
//With unemployment and falling wages, the purchasing power of households has been reduced;
//Small and medium-sized enterprises, under the burden of limited demand and unsustainable borrowing, are closing down or reducing their activities;
//The success story exists only in government propaganda;
//Real and stable growth will come only when citizens have the ability to spend money.
Inequality harms public health and education
//Today, most people are worried that if they become seriously ill they will not be able to afford the care they need;
//At the same time, public health spending has been constrained even though needs have increased.
//If these policies continue, health care will tend to move from being a public good to a privilege of the wealthy.
//The same danger looms for public education.
//The reversal of education reform and austerity policies are damaging public schools, turning those with greater financial means towards private schools.
Inequality harms society
//The austerity policies of the Troika and the Anastasiades-DISY government have dramatically changed Cypriot society;
//90% of Cypriot citizens have suffered from recession and austerity while the richest 10% have increased their incomes.
//The middle class is being squeezed and shrinking;
//The popular classes are suffering under the burden of unemployment, forced migration, the shrinking of the welfare state and deregulation of labour relations to the detriment of workers.
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INEQUALITY AT THE ACKEL
//The economic policy of the Government and DISY is anti-social;
//This policy is behind the great increase in inequality in Cyprus, harms the income and opportunities of the average citizen and favours only the few;
//Akelos, with its action inside and outside the Parliament, is opposed to these policies.
//Every action, every position or proposal in Parliament is based on how it will affect the everyday person in our country;
//With young people, we strive to be able to get ahead in life, to be educated and to find a good job;
//To have opportunities to progress in life without being doomed from the start because he or his family is not wealthy.
WHAT WE PROPOSE
//-Promote policies that will bring growth. With public investment, by lowering interest rates and restoring those social policies that support the popular and middle classes.
//We have proposed many policy measures to stop the march towards ever greater economic inequality.
//So that economic growth benefits the many and not just a small privileged group
: For the unemployed: Extending the duration of unemployment benefits;
//Reducing or abolishing charges for the unemployed;
//Special programme aimed at reintegrating the long-term unemployed;
//For workers. Reversal of the deregulation of labour relations.
//Covering all workers by the provisions of collective agreements.
//Policies aimed at increasing wages in the private sector.
//For the low-paid and the welfare state: gradual restoration of the cuts in benefits that were cut off.
//Widening of the criteria that currently exclude people with pressing needs from social protection.
//For small and medium-sized enterprises: Creating a central financing body, which will make it easier and less costly to provide liquidity
//Relieving SMEs and households from over-borrowing with meaningful measures
//You can make a difference !
//To protect public wealth //For
access to health for all
//For quality education
//For a society with more mutual aid and less inequality
Press conference of the General Secretary of the Central Election Committee of AKEL, Andros Kyprianou, on Real Estate Tax
13 May 2016
//In order to serve the interests of large property owners, DISY-DIKO and the Anastasiades government proceeded in 2013 to amend the legislation, transferring the tax burden to small property owners;
//Their ultimate goal is the complete abolition of the graduated taxation and the imposition of a single, horizontal rate of 1‰;
//In practice, this means a tax transfer of about €25 million from large property owners to small and medium property owners.
//AkEL, during the debate in the Parliament in 2015, with proposals tabled, sought: the exemption of a house worth €30,000, at 1980 prices, from property taxation.
//doubling the deduction from 15% to 30% by submitting a costed proposal that would not affect the overall revenue but would reduce the burden on small and medium property
//Our position is: The adoption of a gradually increasing rate where large property would bear the greatest tax burden;
//The exemption of small property from taxation and by extension the protection of the primary residence from the tax burden;
//The reduction of the collection target set by the Government resulting in society being overburdened;
//The elimination of any attempt to adopt a horizontal tax rate that ignores the economic size and tax capacity of each household.
Divestments
//AKEL consistently opposed and denounced from the outset the philosophy of the rulers and the Troika for massive property disposals in a flattening and indiscriminate manner between debtors.
//The aim of AKEL's effort was not to cover up the big debtors who refuse to pay their debts.
//AKEL's aim was to create a legislative framework that would protect those families and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, the unemployed and those who, due to the crisis, have lost a significant part of their incomes and cannot meet their loan instalments today.
//During the debate on the legislation on divestments and the insolvency framework, among other things, we tabled proposals aimed at: Protection of the main residence and small business housing for loans up to €350 thousand.
//Exemption of guarantors from any obligations in the event of a mortgage sale.
//Exemption of micro-debtors from the balance of debts in the event of a mortgage sale.
//Prohibit the sale of property of owners who do not have title and are consistent with their obligations, but risk losing their property due to insolvent land developers.
//Prohibit the sale of loans to financial institutions that are not licensed and not subject to the control of the Central Bank, so that exactly the same conditions as banks would apply in case the sale of loans would be allowed.
//Enforcement of the right of borrowers to choose the valuation of the Land Registry and not of the bank.
//Setting a fixed default interest rate of up to 2%.
//Enforcement of the right of recourse to the court for retroactive deduction of late payment interest, costs and other abusive charges and even the burden of proof to be transferred from the debtor to the bank.
//Prohibition of the participation of shareholders and bank officials in auctions, in order to control corruption.
//Procedure for suspension of divestment, following a justified complaint to the Central Bank of Cyprus.
//The obligation for the Central Bank to inform Parliament every quarter on the progress of restructuring by banking institution and loan category.
//Free legal assistance to borrowers for the divestment process.
//In the new parliamentary term we are ready to table more proposals to protect the right to housing.
Statement by AKEL General Secretary A. Kyprianou on the unemployed
//A very negative element in Cyprus, apart from the level of unemployment, is the existence of a very high long-term unemployment rate.
//In 2015 the percentage of people who remain unemployed for more than 6 months reached 63.4% of the total.
//They remain at the same high levels of 2014 where the percentage was 65.8% and in numbers 45,790.
//Among the young unemployed, unemployment is at 30.5% with the data referring to December 2015.
//This rate ranks us 5th worst in the European Union.
//Long-term unemployed and young unemployed people need support, protection and above all policies that will help them to find quality and decent work again.
//To address a problem, it must first be identified.
//Herein lies the problem with the Anastasiades-Association Government. They refuse to see that there is a problem with the long-term unemployed.
// They insist on living in their own world, under the illusion that the long-term unemployed are few or completely satisfied with the crumbs of the Minimum Guaranteed Income, if they receive it.
//AkEL is proposing concrete measures in order to address to some extent the great difficulties that the recession and austerity policies have brought to the long-term unemployed and the young unemployed.
// We recommend: Increase the unemployment benefit payment period from the current 6 months to 9 months.
//Modification of the conditions for receiving unemployment benefit.
//The aim is to facilitate young people who are registered as unemployed and who, due to prolonged unemployment, have not been able to make contributions to the social security system.
//Reduction of the working period for entitlement to unemployment benefit from the current 26 weeks.
//Development of a special social support plan for the long-term unemployed and young unemployed who do not fall under the criteria for receiving a minimum guaranteed income.
//The plan should provide, among other things, for a reduction or exemption from fees and taxes (e.g. fees at state hospitals, municipal fees, real estate taxes, traffic taxes, etc.) subsidies based on the family's income in relation to childcare and crèche fees, child protection and creative activity centres, tuition fees at state training institutes, public transport and the cost of providing basic goods, electricity, telecommunications and water supply.
//I also recall the amendments that we tabled in Parliament when the imposition of medical fees in hospitals was being discussed.
// At that time we were asking for exceptions which included the unemployed.
//Finally, as AKEL, we have on many occasions underlined the need for a National Strategy on hydrocarbon management.
//We have demonstrated the need to utilize Cypriot manpower that will be trained in the subject.
// / Also, in the case of investments in the gas sector, it should be a condition that in order to undertake any project, the new jobs should be filled by personnel registered with the Public Employment Service.
//These proposals constitute immediate policy measures.
//The effective solution to the problem of long-term unemployment requires an active economic policy that will increase public and private investment,
// will create permanent, full and quality jobs
// and will halt income inequality, which is currently on a dramatic upward trend.
Statement by AKEL General Secretary A. Kyprianou at a press conference on youth issues
//The first thing I want to assure the young people of Cyprus is that in AKEL we do not live in our microcosm.
// We know very well that the first thing that is said in most groups of young people who happen to discuss the elections is "everyone is the same".
//It's "it's not worth bothering with", it's "I'm not bothered, let them cut their own throats, I'll mind my own business"
//No one does justice to young people who think that way. They are angry at everyone.
// They are above all afraid for their future, for tomorrow.
// They are angry that their friends, relatives or even themselves have been or will be forced to migrate.
// They are frustrated with the situation.
// Worst of all: they don't believe anyone anymore.
// We all have our responsibilities for this. But we are not all the same.
//It is true that the Anastasiades-Association government is trying to convince us that we are all the same because it is betting on a level playing field. //It
is betting on inaction.
//It is hoping for indifference to the elections so as not to be punished at the ballot box.
//This is why it is cultivating the myth that "we are all to blame".
//We are not all equally responsible.
//Yes, we all made mistakes. But we didn't all make criminal mistakes.
//We all have our positions that some may disagree with politically and it makes sense.
//But we didn't all knowingly lie to the people.
//We all have our weaknesses. But we didn't all magically find ourselves involved in suspicious money transfers in closed periods, in strange law firm affairs, in cases of corruption.
//We all have our weaknesses in our day-to-day work. But we do not all express ourselves with arrogance, authoritarianism and contempt for workers.
//It was at least provocative for the President to state that wages may not be satisfactory, but at least workers contribute to the financial budget.
//Let him ask the young people who work for EUR 500 a month how they can make ends meet and contribute to their families as well.
//Averof Neophytou was equally provocative when he called the EUR 800 workers comfortable.
// The bitter truth is that the Government and DISY do not hesitate to act with arrogance and authoritarianism.
// They do not hesitate to dismantle everything, just to serve their few and select friends.
//Thus, in Cyprus today, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the young people feel they have no tomorrow in their country.
//Most young people in Cyprus feel that nothing will change if they go to vote.
//But the reality is exactly the opposite. Nothing will change if they abstain.
// Abstention will not reduce unemployment.
// It will not increase the 500 euro wages that young people currently receive.
// Nor will it give rights to those who work for literally nothing, with individual contracts or even without social security.
// Abstention will not help students who interrupt their studies.
// Abstention will not ensure that public education and public health will be completely saved
// That housing programmes for young couples will fall from the sky
// Abstention will not prevent divestment, the sale of loan packages to investment funds, or the selling off of public wealth
// We are addressing every young person today
// They may not agree with AKEL on everything. But in our positions they will see their own interests.
//In our proposals they will see the defence of their own rights.
//Extension of unemployment benefit.
//Establishment of an unemployment card for unemployed young people.
//Reduction of military service.
//Increase of the minimum wage and strict controls for its observance.
//Defence of the welfare state.
//Securing Sunday holidays.
//Promoting the employment of skilled labour in industry.
//Promoting research and innovation for the employment of young scientists.
//New departments and faculties at PANKYP and TEPAK.
//Securing all student allowances and much more are our political proposal to young people.
//But we do not only want to say. We also want to listen.
//We believe that we can meet in joint actions with the young people of our country who are suffocating in the outdated concepts that want to keep our society tied to the old and rotten. //We
as AKEL may have our own analysis of society and the economy, of the system in which we live,
//but that does not mean that we are unable to discuss with young people, to listen to positions and ideas, to take joint initiatives.
//We are here because we want to pave the way for the new.
//We are here because we want to pave the way for the future of the young people of our country.
//If there is a force that can fight for the solution of the Cyprus problem, that can build the future of a reunited Cyprus together with our Turkish Cypriot compatriots, it is AKEL.
//If there is a force that can stand up against the unpopular policies, that can stand up in and out of Parliament against the dismantling and levelling of what our people have built over the years, it is AKEL.
//If there is a force that can make a difference, it is AKEL.
//So let the young people give strength to their strength!
// Let them make a difference together with AKEL-Left!
