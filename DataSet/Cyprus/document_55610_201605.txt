SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT
FOUNDING DECLARATION
//The Republic of Cyprus is under constant attack on its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and its very existence,
//from Turkey, which is methodically working for the dissolution of the Cypriot State.
// The policy of Turkification and Islamization of Cyprus is continuous and unabated.
//At the same time, the Cypriot state is going through an unprecedented economic,
//socio-ethics,
//political and institutional crisis.
//Our national issue is slipping dangerously,
//the talks are held in secret
//and the people either don't know what's going on, or are deliberately misinformed.
//The prospects of avoiding total destruction, if the same policy continues, are zero.
//For the dire situation in which the Republic of Cyprus finds itself, both the present and previous governments bear a heavy responsibility.
//and the morbid mentality of factionalism, nepotism, partisanship and corruption that dominated and still dominate the Cypriot state.
// "The work of the citizens is the salvation of the state" said Aristotle, and we feel this work and this debt is very heavy.
//Founding SOLIDARITY with all those who wish the continuation of our natural, national and state presence
//and we will stand as a mound and be the obstacle to the dangerous slides of those who manage the National Issue.
//Aware of the criticality of the moments and the exhaustion of any time margin,
//but also the dramatic change in the geostrategic environment in which Cyprus is located
//and wanting to contribute to any effort to claim a just solution,
// join forces with those who are concerned about the future of the Republic of Cyprus.
//At a time of geopolitical instability in our region, but also in general,
//In an era when the balance of power is constantly being reshaped and opportunistic alliances are collapsing, we cannot remain timid and timid, at the tail end of developments and the new geopolitical scene that is taking shape.
//And while Turkey's strategic plans are being shaken,
//We cannot stand by inadequately to react and exploit the tactical setting.
//With full awareness of the risks for the Republic of Cyprus
//and for the evolutionary partitioning and Turkification of our country, we strongly resist.
//We are not afraid to declare our readiness to oppose solutions that serve the policy of the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus.
//We will passionately support any solution that safeguards our human rights as defined through the United Nations Charter and the European Union Charter,
//without discounts and derogations because we are not "lysophobic".
//But we will stand in the way of a solution that does not fully guarantee freedoms
//and our rights.
//At the same time we are fighting for our national survival,
//we cannot ignore the fact that the inadequate and miserable practices that have been and are being followed have led a large percentage of the People to live below the poverty line
//and even greater to suffer.
//The state and society are in a period of deep decline
// and the functions of the state are being undermined from within, by the great interconnectedness and corruption in political life, in the institutions and in society itself.
// Long-term decay has eroded the social fabric,
//threatens social cohesion
//and it has created particularly objectionable and dangerous cracks in the prestige of our statehood.
//Aiming to end the progressive decline
//and with a vision to turn Cyprus into a model of a state governed by the rule of law,
//a model of a free democratic state,
//in a modern, secure, prosperous European country, we are founding the SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT.
//ALLILEGYH is a patriotic force
//that serves the citizen with a view to equality,
// moderation, logic, unity of purpose, understanding and cooperation.
/ / / It is the new modern face of politics based on ideals, ethics, transparency, truth, virtues, principles, values, justice.
//The strategic vision of the patriotic movement "ALLILEGYI" has as its central objectives:
//The universal liberation of Cyprus through the achievement of a democratic agreement for a solution
//which will be founded on the human freedoms, principles and values of the European Union and the United Nations Charter.
//A solution that will make the Republic of Cyprus an equal, free, democratic, European state.
// With all its inhabitants, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Latins, Armenians, living and creating freely throughout the territory of Cyprus,
// under a regime of equality and equality of rights, free from racial, religious and racist discrimination and restrictions.
//To address the unprecedented and ongoing political, economic, social, institutional and moral decadence that the Cypriot state is experiencing and which contributes to the decay of the state and society.
//The fight against corruption, opacity, corruption, complicity, impunity, injustice and inefficiency that undermine the functioning of the state.
//The restoration of citizens' trust in the institutions through the implementation of laws,
//Justice,
// the exemplary punishment of the guilty
//and the investigation to the end of all scandals.
// Achieving the institutional, economic, social and political reforms that Cyprus needs today to become a modern, secure and safe,
//European rule of law,
//competitive in investment,
// with jobs,
//liberal economy
// and strong defense.
//A social cohesion state with credible, transparent, democratic institutions
//and welfare mechanisms,
//to respect its citizens and offer them safety, security, quality of life
//and equal opportunities.
//Fundamental principles of the patriotic movement ALLILEGYH are freedom,
// democracy and justice,
// the isonomy,
// meritocracy, the defence of individual and social rights
//and the protection of social cohesion,
//of the dignity and patriotic pride of Cypriot citizens.
//ALLILEGYH is an unaffiliated, multiracial Movement, acting freely and autonomously, under the guidance of its collective organs, aiming at the creative overthrow of the bankrupt system that destroyed Cyprus.
//With SOLIDARITY we transform the disjointed forces of the people into a solid, indivisible mass
// and all together we become strong and all together we are the power of a strong subversive social movement for the rebirth of our country.
//To achieve this great goal, we stand together in SOLIDARITY with our compatriots,
// out of the trivialities of party standards and the worn-out ideologies of old partyism,
// to give vision and hope to our people
//and to found a new state on virtues, ideals, principles and values.
//We barricade ourselves in the same trenches in a popular uprising,
//to resist the pernicious plans for the disappearance of Hellenism from Cyprus.
//To get rid of the vicious people who plunder public wealth
// and the existence of the state
// and flatten the collective dignity of society
//and the patriotic pride of the citizens.
//To passionately support a political system free from corruption, corruption, corruption, populism, incompetence and inefficiency.
// To rediscover traditional principles and values,
//the ideals and virtues of our people, which kept us alive and strong in difficult times.
//ALLILEGYH is the catalyst for the implementation of modern ideas, for the formulation of proposals and the implementation of strategic actions concerning society, economy, culture, women, youth, the unemployed, young scientists, farmers, pensioners, the retired, the low paid, refugees, the physically, mentally and intellectually disadvantaged, all those who have not had the opportunity of education and training,
//the disappearing middle class
//and economic development of our country.
//ALLILEGYH stands by the refugees, the stranded, the relatives of the missing, the victims of the economic crisis.
//It embraces the low pensioners, impoverished families and those who are crowded in social grocery stores,
// supports our housekeeping compatriots who have locked themselves out of their jobs and their dream has become a nightmare.
//Support our young people who are forced to interrupt their studies due to financial constraints
//or languish in waiting and unemployment for a job.
//HALLILEGYI seeks to turn frustration, disillusionment, anger and indignation into a movement of resistance,
// patriotic renaissance movement.
//The identity and the qualitative characteristics of the Movement are self-evident from the etymology of the name ALLILEGYH.
//SOLIDARITY is our power to overturn the current shaky situation.
//We demand rights to education, health and employment that must not only be guaranteed in the Constitution, but must be implemented in practice.
//With our responsibility and duty towards our country and our children as our compass,
//we call upon all our compatriots and especially the young people of the country for a struggle for freedom, dignity and hope.
//We call on every compatriot who does not accept the ongoing destruction and deconstruction of the state,
// We call on every compatriot who refuses to be an accomplice to the crime being committed to join the patriotic movement ALLILEGYE.
//We call on every compatriot who experiences daily the inadequacy of the institutions, who suffers from the abolition of the welfare state,
// suffering from the multi-tasking civil service,
//which feels deeply offended by the impunity of the guilty parties of the multiple scandals that have destroyed the state,
// join the patriotic movement ALLILEGYH to raise the sun over Cyprus.
//We appeal to every compatriot who is ready to defend social cohesion,
//we appeal to every citizen who wants to prevent the destruction of our children's future to join our effort.
//ALLILEGYH rejects the failed models of organization of the old party regimes.
//It is staffed by volunteers and operates collectively with democratic and transparent procedures.
//Establishes freedom of expression by using mechanisms of direct democracy and continuous consultation.
//At the same time it introduces another relationship with citizens. Opening a channel of direct communication with them.
// Utilizing human contact and all modern technological means of communication.
//ALLILEGYH embraces and relies on the new generation.
// It seeks the criticism of young people and listens to their anxieties, suggestions and dreams.
/ / / Against corruption and opaque practices,
//The patriotic movement ALLILEGYH, in order to ensure independence and autonomy from all kinds of economic interests and systems of power, will cover its financial needs with self-financing from its volunteers.
// Fully transparent, without costly operations, based on voluntary work and with strict financial and lean management.
//We are confident that the present declaration of the SOLIDARITY movement reflects the demands, beliefs, aspirations and vision of the Cypriot people.
// and serves the dignity, pride and patriotism of each of our compatriots.
FOUNDING DECLARATION
CYPRUS
There has never been a strategy and vision
//On the Cyprus issue since 1974 we have been fighting and disagreeing with each other.
// We have never had a strategy that unites the parties or a vision that unites the people.
// Turkey has managed to convince internationally that in 1974 it brought peace to Cyprus, since then there is no problem and there are two peoples and two nation states on the island.
Negative Existential Risks
//The anti-establishment resistance tends to disappear;
//The upgrading of the pseudo-state prevents the acceptance of our positions;
//Turkey exploits the negotiations to gain political gains;
//A new generation of politicians in the occupied territories convincingly promote Turkish objectives in Cyprus;
//The appeals to the "Compensation Committee" create new achievements on the ground;
//Cyprus and Greece are vulnerable to pressures due to the crisis.
Positive Strong Foundations
//The participation of the Republic of Cyprus in European and international decision-making centres and the discovery of natural gas has lifted Cyprus out of decades of geopolitical hostage-taking;
//It has put it on the energy map;
//It has helped it in its partnerships with Israel, Egypt, Greece, European countries, the US and Russia.
//It has given it the power to work with governments and economic giants that influence developments in the Eastern Mediterranean.
//Stakeholders must understand that stability, peace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean can only be ensured with a proper solution to the Cyprus problem.
//A bad solution will blow up everything and they must prevent it to protect their interests and investments.
Turkish Intransigence Remains
//Negotiations are not progressing in a way that would give hope that Turkish intransigence has changed.
//Mustafa Akinci, despite the expectation that he had different views on the Cyprus problem, unfortunately, has now fortified himself behind Ankara's firm positions on guaranteed majorities, on deviations from the acquis, on settlers remaining, on a rotating presidency.
//In a highly provocative act, the US Embassy recently received the officials of the occupying army;
//The pro-Turkish lobby in Brussels is pushing for the opening of funds for Turkey;
//All these are elements that kill hope and take us back to the stone years of stagnation in the Cyprus issue.
EUROPEAN SOLUTION
What is the European Solution
//The European solution is a coherent strategy for the Cyprus problem;
//alongside the UN,
//as an equal member of the EU, we must use the institutions and bodies of the Union,
//to exert pressure and create political costs on Turkey to abandon intransigence and to force it to cooperate on the Cyprus problem.
Content of the European Solution
//The European Acquis, the EU's Principles and Values are embedded in the functioning of our 28 partner states;
//They govern the lives of almost half a billion people;
//These principles and values can become the foundation for building a functional, prosperous and secure state in Cyprus.
// For this to happen, we must abandon logics of accepting racist and racial divisions such as the Bi-zonal Bicommunal Federation which will perpetuate the Cyprus problem instead of solving it.
The European Solution convinces the Turkish Cypriots
//Citizens are asking for peace, security, perspective, prosperity, progress;
//The overwhelming majority on both sides in Cyprus accept that the EU can be the solid foundation for building a free European state
that will guarantee security
and respect the principles of democracy,
fundamental political and human rights and the basic freedoms of all Cypriots.
//The European Solution can be a common goal and unite the interests in the two communities and become the basic pillar on which the future of the Cypriot people will be securely built.
//The acquis, which regulates the coexistence, cooperation and co-existence of 28 nation states, can provide a basis for ideas and good practices for the Cyprus problem
// and can be the common basis for negotiation and the catalyst for a solution.
//The European solution will be based on the acquis. //It will be
guaranteed by its democratic character and the principles on which the EU is founded;
//It will unite and not divide Cyprus;
//It will allow Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to live together, throughout the territory of the Republic of Cyprus,
//under full equality and equal rights as EU citizens;
//Such a solution will be acceptable and viable.
ADVANTAGES
GEOPOLITICAL POSITION
//Cyprus' important geopolitical position that allows it to be a bridge between Europe, Africa and Asia and a gateway to the EU borders.
NATURAL WEALTH
//Cyprus' natural wealth, with the existence of rich gas and oil deposits in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), allowing it to become a secure energy centre serving all neighbouring countries.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS HUB
//Cyprus' telecommunications infrastructure, making it an important data transfer hub and satellite crossroads.
SHIPPING SHIP MANAGEMENT
//Cyprus is a proven emerging shipping power;
//The Cypriot fleet is among the top ten registers in the world in size and is the third largest in Europe
; //Cyprus' ship management industry is the second largest in the world;
//Cyprus has even become the headquarters for some of the world's largest shipping companies.
AIRSPACE FIR
//Cyprus has a FIR of 175 thousand square kilometres, which is a multiple of the ten thousand square kilometres that is its territory.
HUMAN RESOURCES - DIASPORA MIGRANTS
//The biggest asset that constitutes a comparative advantage for Cyprus is its human resources;
//Cypriots are pro-progressive citizens and the majority of them are highly qualified university graduates and graduates.
SERVICE CENTRE
//Despite the destruction of the banking sector, Cyprus still has an attractive service sector that has room to regain its lost vitality
ECONOMIC TOURISM CENTRE
//Cyprus has the infrastructure to further develop as an economic and tourist centre in the Eastern Mediterranean that is attractive to foreign capital inflows from abroad.
MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
//Cyprus' European status enables it to be the representative of the Union in our region and to be the gateway to the European Union.
CULTURE AND HISTORY
//Cyprus is a cradle of culture;
//This culture is our heritage;
//It is our root with the past and our hope for the future;
//Cyprus' cultural heritage is a tool for creation, development and international intervention.
ECONOMY
New Economic Framework
//The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge we have in our country today is to lay the foundations for a new sustainable framework for economic activity.
//We have no choice but to exploit the potential and comparative advantages of Cyprus in sectors that have high added value for the Cypriot economy.
Development is lagging behind
//Difficult and adverse economic conditions continue in the economy;
//Despite progress in public finances, despite the stabilisation of the banking sector,
//growth is slowing down,
//unemployment is still high
//and those businesses that continue to operate are also on the edge.
Back to Growth
//In order to return to growth, the state must proceed with infrastructure projects;
//The private sector and investors must be facilitated to invest;
//The Juncker Investment Fund and the ECB's quantitative easing programme are useful tools for the absorption of development funds.
Fighting Bureaucracy and High Salary Cuts
//A crucial factor for growth is the fight against bureaucracy,
the containment of public spending and the rationalisation of high public sector salaries and pensions,
//in order for the state to save resources for development actions
//that will create jobs to reduce unemployment.
Banks to Boost Market Liquidity
//Banks need to open the spigots of their funds to boost liquidity for businesses and the market;
//They need to get serious about restructuring many of the bad loans because the threat of NPLs is too great.
EDUCATION
POSITIONS OF THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT FOR EDUCATION
//Pedagogy and Education are the foundations of the nation's cohesion and the cohesion and dynamism of society.
// It is the means to promote the cultivation of good citizens who will support society and fight for their country.
//As Nelson Mandela used to say, education is the only way for a country to get out of poverty and confront anti-democratic attitudes
//We want Cyprus' education to create good Greeks and be based on lifelong learning through a structured educational system that embraces all citizens
//and will guide them through a framework of equal opportunities,
// utilizing the potential of each individual for the benefit of the Republic of Cyprus, all citizens without discrimination, the EU, the whole world.
//We seek the mental and physical well-being and mental health of students.
//We want the development of mutual respect,
//of critical thinking,
//of respect for diversity,
//in humanistic values and in the truth of others,
//we want to develop environmental awareness,
//patriotism
//and awareness of our historical course.
//The educational system in Cyprus has serious weaknesses both in terms of administration, curriculum and infrastructure.
//Cypriots, having gone through long periods of slavery and poverty, where their national consciousness was strongly suppressed and the opportunities for learning were few, have developed a great affinity for study and the cultivation of the mind.
//There is good infrastructure in terms of school buildings and very good educational potential.
//However, the educational system of Cyprus must change and be oriented towards the creation of modern and effective scientists, researchers, technicians and qualified personnel, taking advantage of the possibility of implementing European programmes.
//Educational reform is a key component of effective education.
WEAKNESSES AND RISKS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
//The administration is under the control of factionalism and is subservient to political parties and suffers from hyper-centralization;
//The system of recruitment and evaluation of teachers working in public schools is outdated and inefficient;
//The main weaknesses of the educational system are: Inadequate training of teachers; //The
main target of the system is examinations;
//The curriculum is not up-to-date and appropriate;
//The cultivation of critical thinking is incomplete; //The
scourge of para-education is perpetuated by the inactivation of hundreds of excellent teachers
//and the financial bleeding of the weaker classes;
//The existing education system leads to the de-familialization of students,
//the loss of our historical identity.
OBJECTIVES AND PROPOSALS
//Our aim is to form a system of inspired, dedicated and ambitious teachers who, through the implementation of a modern curriculum, will contribute to the proper education of children.
//and to improve their character and personality.
//Our goal is to shape a democratic citizen through education,
// with faith in the principles of humanism
//and with philanthropy,
//with altruism and dedication to his duty to himself
//his family
//and society as a whole.
//A citizen loyal to the values of social justice and solidarity.
//Our children must be equipped with knowledge and skills that will enable them to successfully meet the challenges of the future,
//today's technological challenges,
//the market economy ,
// vocational rehabilitation.
//We do not want the mass production of unemployed graduates but the mass production of effective professionals, scientists, researchers, teachers and technicians based on the needs and economic data of the time.
//Our students should be involved in shaping conditions of gender equality and equality for all citizens
// and defend the weak and less privileged.
//Protect the natural and cultural environment
//and promote sustainable development.
//The goal of a strategic plan for education should be the ability to discriminate at the international level.
//We believe that the State must create an effective, fair, meritocratic, economically viable and responsible system that provides equal opportunities and access to education.
//The Solidarity Movement submits a series of proposals in this direction: we consider the autonomy and accountability of school units to be essential.
// School principals should have zero teaching time and be given executive powers to produce effective work.
//The evaluation of school units should be continuous.
//We aim to increase the effectiveness and continuous training of teachers.
// Teachers' effectiveness can be improved if a system of incentives based on their productivity is adopted both at individual and collective level.
/ / / Incentives for the continuous training of teachers.
JUSTICE
Corruption, Complication, Impunity Threaten Us
//The stability of our state is at risk, because fundamental institutions in our country do not function as they are meant to;
//Impunity and unjustice prevail;
//The guilty of scandals and crimes go free;
//The dragging of principles, values and our own lives is evident.
//Demagoguery, arbitrariness, sterile confrontation and extreme provocative populism dominate political discourse.
//This situation honours no one. //It
is the responsibility of all of us to reverse it.
//We have a duty to eradicate corruption, intrigue and impunity from the body of our society.
//We have a duty to identify politics with morality.
Exemplary Punishment of Lawbreakers
//We demand accountability and exemplary punishment for those guilty of the country's destruction;
//The delay in the investigations into the economy and the punishment of the guilty is unjustified;
//Those who stole from the state or the banks should be punished;
//The punishment should be accompanied by confiscation of their assets;
//Return the stolen goods.
Transparency at All Levels
//The principle of full transparency to be applied at all levels of the state;
//The decisions and administrative acts of public bodies to be made public;
//The background of politicians and state officials to be checked by an Independent Authority;
//All state officials to be held accountable for the evaluation of their work;
//Their assets to be checked upon assumption and termination of their term of office.
CHANGE OF POSITIONS
Colleges in the Independent Institutions
//We propose to start the process of changing the Constitution to end the one-person monopoly in institutions such as the Attorney General's Office, the Central Bank, the Audit Office, etc.
//We propose to introduce in Cyprus the European approach of colleges and abandon the Anglo-Saxon one-person practice for independent institutions.
//In every independent institution, decisions should be taken by a three-person college away from any phenomena of interlocking, dependency and political interference;
//In the Central Bank, the Governor should be replaced by a College which will take all decisions with transparency and objectivity;
//Similar colleges must replace with transparency and meritocracy the Attorney General, the Auditor General and all independent institutions in our country.
Replacement of Regulators with a Single Regulatory Authority
//The proliferation of regulators in the operation of the state leads to a bureaucratic management that undermines the mission of the regulatory services;
//We also call for all regulators to be abolished and replaced by a single independent regulator.
Independent Authority against Corruption
// Illegal enrichment - "black" political money - a gangrene that is slowly and progressively eroding and destroying Cypriot society;
//We call for the creation of the Independent Authority against Corruption and Corruption, which will undertake to cleanse the Cypriot state of the widespread corruption that undermines the foundations of society and encourages unscrupulous actions and illegalities at all levels of the State.
