12 POLICY MEASURES FOR A TURNAROUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
Introduction
//The difficult economic situation in which Cyprus finds itself requires new strategies for development that will lead the country to a permanent path of progress, prosperity and improvement of our social and economic data.
//The knowledge economy has been at the heart of the European Union's development effort since the decision of the Lisbon Council in 2000, with the Research and Innovation pillars playing a major role in this effort.
//Cyprus in recent years has been stuck at the bottom of Europe with the key indicator of total investment (public and private sector) stuck at 0.40-0.46% (0.44%:2011) as a percentage of GDP.
//At the same time, the European Union's strategic target is 3%.
//Cyprus in 2005 set a target of reaching 1% by 2010 which it reformulated again in 2010 setting a target of 0.5% by 2020.
//Assuming that Cyprus' GDP is around 18.5D€, this target is in the range of 80E€.
//The European Commission itself has adopted its new programme for Research, Technological Development and Innovation "Horizon 2020" with a total budget of 80D€.
//The process of approving the new financial framework 2014-2020 of the European Union is underway, which will determine the amount of the overall budget and therefore the overall development programme.
//Cyprus is called upon to prepare its programmatic position, both in terms of the size of its development programme,
// and the intensity of the European Union's involvement.
//This programmatic position should be in line with the European Union guidelines which call for 80% of total appropriations to be targeted at the energy sectors (1),
// (2) of Research & Innovation
//and (3) Small and Medium Enterprises.
Location
//The mix of the economy as we have known it so far has to change;
//A new component will definitely be energy;
//The aim is to set a new strategy to turn Cyprus into a knowledge-based economy;
//The very good level of our human resources (in Cyprus and outside), the constantly improving education and research infrastructure, the consolidation of our university institutions and the modern needs for a more competitive economy require a new knowledge-based planning.
//Innovation is a key tool in the whole strategy and will be a key element in any new development programme.
//The failed policy of piecemeal, isolated and disconnected measures has failed with painful results for our economy.
//The strategy which is proposed presents a comprehensive approach covering the whole 'chain' of development.
//Starting from the first 'link' of the strategy and ending with the last one, interventions of a comprehensive approach are proposed.
Objective
//The main goal of the effort is to turn Cyprus into a member state of the European Union, where education, research and the productive fabric are knowledge-intensive.
Index
//The key monitoring indicator will be the ratio of investment in research and innovation to GDP, with the aim of reaching 1.0% in 2020.
Suggestions
1.Increase of the European Union's participation intensity in the Structural Funds to 100% due to the accession of Cyprus to the support mechanism.
//Given the direction of the European Union to target 80% of the new financial framework (Energy, Research and Innovation, SMEs), during the negotiation with the European Commission of the new NSRF (National Strategic Reference Framework) for the period 2014-2020,
//we must aim and insist that the European Union's participation in the development sectors, which it determines, should be 100% in view of the fact that Cyprus has joined the Support Mechanism.
//We recall that the Tassos Papadopoulos Government during the period 2007-2013 had managed to increase the European Union's participation to 85% and 15% of Cyprus,
//while under the DISY government, in the negotiation that took place in 2002 for the period 2004-2006, the European Union's participation was limited to 50%.
2.Linking the Academy with Industry.
//Enhancing the triptych of development of academic institutions (1) providing education, (2) conducting high quality research and (3) offering to society
//Change the way public academic and research institutions are funded
//The state should provide only part of their budget (e.g. 70%) and the rest (e.g. 30%) should be the product of the research activities of the institutions themselves;
//This will strengthen the third pillar of the academy - Teaching - Research - Offering to Society; //This
will give a new impetus to the cooperation between academia and industry, thus creating the basis for its technological upgrading;
//This will be a key tool for a shift towards a knowledge-based industry focused on the development of high-tech and high value-added products and services.
//Modernise and institutionalise a clear Knowledge Transfer Framework that will allow academic and research institutions to propose ideas for development,
//attract investors (public sector, private sector or a combination of both) and subsequently take their ideas forward for development and eventual commercial exploitation.
3.Strengthening the efforts of Cypriot SMEs to shift to knowledge-intensive activities.
//The Government will offer tax incentives to industries investing in research and innovation.
//The equivalent of the investment in research and innovation to be tax deductible.
//This will provide an incentive for businesses to become active in the fields of research and innovation,
// develop partnerships with academic and research institutions,
// develop new products and services,
//become more competitive
//and create new jobs.
//In addition, it is also proposed that the state complements the intensity of funding up to 100% from the structural funds for SMEs participating in European research and development programmes.
//This will help us better target and absorb the funds we need to allocate to research and innovation
4.Making Cyprus a reference point for energy and security in Europe
//It is obvious that we will now have a new very serious component in the new mix of the economy, that of energy and the related industrial sector that can be developed.
//At the same time, the geographical position of Cyprus highlights it as a point of particular importance for Europe on security issues.
//The government in cooperation with our academic institutions to emphasize the creation of curricula in these areas
//and strengthen the effort to create research centres of excellence with the support of the European Union in the fields of production and exploitation of energy resources and hydrocarbon processing
//as well as in the areas of security.
//It is also proposed that the Government formulate a package of tax and other incentives to attract investment in the Petrochemical Industries sector that add value to Natural Gas.
//Since Cyprus has Natural Gas and the Government is proceeding with its exploitation, there will be interest from petrochemical industries.
//These are industries that can create a few thousand new jobs.
5.Exploitation of hydrocarbon revenues from the Cypriot EEZ
//First estimates show that the reserves in the Cypriot EEZ can lead to a very significant source of revenue, part of which is proposed to be used to create a fund to finance research and innovation projects
//with a focus on renewable energy.
6.Reactivation of the institution of Business Incubators
//The institution of Business Incubators which operated successfully during the period 2003-2007 (Papadopoulou Presidency) supported the creation of new high-tech businesses
//and new jobs.
//It is suggested that the institution should be reopened in the same philosophy (Public-Private Partnership)
//and will be included in the programming of the new programming period for funding from the European Regional Development Fund.
//Government will fund Business Plans for the creation of new high-tech enterprises on the basis of a techno-economic assessment
//with new jobs.
//These businesses will be established in business incubators where they will be provided with all the support services to enable them to grow.
//Support private sector efforts to create funding mechanisms for business ideas with a focus on new technologies
//and the creation of new jobs
//The weakness for the coming years of both the state and our financial system
// requires the activation of private capital from either within or outside Cyprus towards the financing of new high-tech businesses.
//The immediate provision of tax exemption to individuals who will invest their personal funds in SMEs is proposed
//provided that new jobs will be created.
//This measure may also apply to those who are willing to repatriate funds from abroad,
//provided that they are invested in sectors and businesses that create new jobs.
//Encourage large semi-governmental organisations (ATHK, AHK, ALK) to create special funds through which they can finance new business ideas in their fields of activity (Telecommunications, Energy, Maritime).
//To support financially through an appropriate programme Technology Platforms which are to be integrated into the respective European
//and to be encouraged (with the participation of the public sector) to create funds to finance research and innovation projects in the specific sectors.
//To encourage the organisation and creation of private funds for the financing of research and innovation projects
8. Modernisation of the national Research & Development system Modernisation of the National Research and Innovation System and the Management Framework for Research and Innovation Programmes
//The existing Research & Development system Innovation system should be enriched with an emphasis on its applied dimension and with the parallel involvement of enterprises in its constituent bodies.
//The following are recommended: Cyprus Scientific Council: Participation of representatives of the business community to ensure and monitor the targeting of applied research
//Research Promotion Foundation: Strengthening the participation of the business community on its Board of Directors to better develop and implement applied research programmes
//The management system for research and technology programmes and other programmes to be financed by the Structural Funds should be simplified for the benefit of the substance.
//The serious problems that have arisen in the current programming period must be addressed.
//The introduction of information and internet technologies, the simplification of procedures, proper planning and strict adherence to time schedules are conditions that should be required.
9. Activation of the Technology Park in Pentakomo.
//The Technology Park started as an initiative under the Ministry of G.Lillikas which has not been implemented to date;
//The Park should play the role of a (first) technology pole in Cyprus;
//The allocation of plots to Cypriot high-tech companies is proposed
//while at the same time a programme should be developed on the basis of incentives (tax, land concessions, etc.) to high-tech companies from abroad.
//It is also proposed to develop specific infrastructure in which high-tech companies can be established, along the lines of the 'IT buildings' in India.
10. Modernisation of Policy for Industrial Areas
//Review of all beneficiaries established within the Industrial Areas in relation to compliance with the original settlement agreement;
//Development of new industrial areas, the management of which may be given to business associations;
//Encourage local government agencies to establish industrial/manufacturing zones within their jurisdictional boundaries.
11. Upgrading the transnational cooperation with Israel and expanding it in the field of Research and Technology as well as corporate partnerships
//Cooperation with Israel and the utilization of the Israel-Cyprus corridor can create, beyond political
//and serious economic and development opportunities.
//Given Israel's political and regional blockade and the serious problems it has in exporting and providing services to the Arab market.
//The development of cooperation programs between Cypriot and Israeli companies with the active support of governmental services is proposed.
//These programmes will aim to create joint ventures between companies from the two countries based in Cyprus.
//This will provide expertise and internationalisation to Cypriot companies
//while offering better access to the European market, easier exports and access to the currently non-existent Arab-Muslim market for Israel.
//Among the sectors offered are High Technology Industries, Medical Services and of course Energy.
// / The signing of an agreement between Israel and Cyprus in the fields of Research, Technology and Innovation is required.
12. Introducing Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Education
//The whole effort to shift to a knowledge economy relies heavily on the creation of a new culture within society and among young people in particular.
//Education plays an important role in this effort.
//Proposed by the Ministry of Education & The Ministry of Education and Culture should elaborate specific modules on Innovation and Entrepreneurship to be integrated into the curricula of all levels of education (primary, secondary and high school).
//It is also proposed that universities should integrate the institution of student placements in companies to the greatest extent possible.
//While a compulsory practical training should also be included in the curriculum.
//The student at some stage at the end of the studies will be required to be employed in a specific subject related to his/her studies in cooperation with a company or an organisation.
Citizens' Alliance positions on the issues of people with intellectual disabilities
//Intellectual disability, whether it is Autism, Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Fragile X, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, intellectual disability, or other developmental disorders, is a condition that touches everyone - the people who have a diagnosis, parents, siblings, grandparents, entire families, their friends, their schools and government agencies, the communities in which they live, our society for as long as the person with autism lives, from cradle to grave.
//It has been accepted, and there are several studies, that early intervention with diagnosis and the provision of appropriate services and support can provide invaluable positive outcomes for all those involved in autism.
//When people with intellectual disabilities and their families are provided with the appropriate support through treatments, education and information, it is almost certain that the child with autism will enjoy a decent standard of living and be able to understand his/her world.
//The public investment in diagnosis and support will be returned in the form of lower spending in the future on benefits, special education, social employment services, institutionalisation, etc.
//Intellectual disability requires a multi-layered approach and the Department of Labor must take a professorial and strategic role.
//Due to the small size of Cyprus, we believe that we can get results quickly if we organise ourselves properly.
//The creation of a body, committee, group, whatever that will create a Design for this multi-level approach is the first step and should involve all stakeholders. People with intellectual disabilities, parents, therapists, researchers, educators, administrators, government officials, etc.
//Planning should include an analysis of the needs of people with intellectual disabilities with data collection on which to base the strategy design and the activities to be carried out.
//The needs analysis will also determine the cost of serving the needs of people with intellectual disabilities.
//We know what needs to be done about intellectual disability in Cyprus.
//We know how to do it.
//We know approximately how much it costs for each person depending on their needs and environment.
//We know what the results we seek are.
//We know that the public sector does not have the structures or the know-how to support people with intellectual disabilities.
//Funding for most of them is already provided by the state through various mechanisms.
//There is a huge expertise in NGOs which will be able to offer services to people with intellectual disabilities, since the state covers 100% of the costs of providing services to the person with intellectual disabilities.
//We need coordination from the public sector, which is the main financial contributor, in order to properly manage intellectual disability, to create expertise in intellectual disability
// and to reduce the stress in which families of people with intellectual disabilities live.
Specific recommendations for government action on intellectual disability.
1.Registration and information of all persons involved in the management of a person with intellectual disability through the creation of an electronic database.
//CTEAA has an obligation to conduct disability assessment and offer optional functional assessment;
//For people with intellectual disabilities, disability assessment through the ICF enables people who support people with intellectual disabilities to create goals to improve the performance of these people.
//No matter where the assessment is done and who has to do it, an electronic database based on the ICF should be created and this database can be accessed by each professional to inform and intervene to provide newer information and set goals that are accessible to all involved.
2.Early intervention with treatments for ages 0-6.
//Having assessed functionality based on the ICF, professionals determine their intervention according to their specialty and the needs of the person with intellectual disability.
//All stakeholders receive notification of any changes in functionality, which is measured at least annually through the achievement of professional goals.
//By means of the functional assessment, the Ministry of Labour will fund the intervention for children with disabilities through the EEP as provided for in Article 34 (3) of the EEP Law (in addition to the disability allowance of €226).
//If the state takes into account its costs for allowances through the EEE, program funding through NGOs, kindergarten and pre-primary attendants and special education in a public kindergarten unit, it spends about €105,000 by age 6 for each child with an intellectual disability diagnosed at 18 months, about €1,900 every month.
//In cerebral palsy or Down's syndrome, the cost is higher because the diagnosis is made earlier.
//The cost of proper intervention for people with intellectual disabilities who do not have other disabilities is about €1,700 per month.
//The expenditure should be made with a voucher and not with cash.
//Coupons will be redeemed only in registered professionals and/or centres that offer several treatments together in order to ensure proper coordination.
//With the use of the database and early intervention which will have removed several behavioural issues, the child will go to kindergarten for one year and then continue to primary school in a regular class or a unit.
//Monitoring and updating of all stakeholders continues, and educational objectives are again set based on the ICF.
//Disability allowance for people with disabilities returns back to normal.
//Optionally, the Ministry of Education may allow parents to enroll their children in a private school and have the state cover 80% of the actual cost of the public school for each child with disabilities.
3.Coming of age for people with intellectual disabilities
//According to the Law on Mentally Retarded Persons, the basic right of mentally retarded persons is defined as a decent living and social security adapted to their needs and abilities.
//The responsibility for the legal protection and full insurance of these rights rests with the state.
//It is the responsibility of the state to provide the retarded person with the necessary means of care and treatment to ensure human dignity, healthy living and development to the extent that his or her capabilities allow.
//Practically, the application of the law by the Social Welfare Services is limited to "three meals a day and a bed to sleep in at night".
//We recommend that upon graduation from school at 18 or 21, the person with intellectual disabilities should be able to choose a program or programs in which he or she can be included.
//These programmes will be offered by the local government or the private sector which is mostly made up of NGOs.
//The state will have to cost these services, which will be categorised according to the place of residence of the person with disabilities, either at home or in an organised place.
//The Ministry of Labour will finance these services according to the individual needs of each disabled person as stated in all legislation and international conventions.
3A.Ward 34.
//The cost of ward 34, with its 10 people with Autism and mild psychiatric issues, costs around €600,000 per year.
//It is worth the General Accounting Office's determination.
//It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour to de-institutionalise them.
//We are sure that for the expenditure the state is now making, it will have no difficulty in finding competent professionals with years of experience who can take care of these people and offer them better living conditions for the rest of their lives.
Proposal for the creation of a Deputy Ministry of Citizen Services at the Ministry of Finance
//1.The Deputy Ministry will consist of the Department of Information Technology, the Department of Public Administration and Personnel, the Department of State Purchasing and Procurement and the Commissioner for Reform.
//In addition, ALL the state's IT systems will be transferred to the State Department.
//2.ALL procedures in the public sector will be carried out through the Citizen Service Centres (KEP).
//3.Natural and legal persons will submit a completed application form and all documents that are not issued by the state.
//4.The application will be checked at the KEPs, completed with the data of the natural or legal person, printed and signed by the natural or legal person on the spot until the implementation of the legislation on electronic signature.
//5.The CCPs will complete the application with the documents that the natural or legal person would provide and which are issued by the state.
//In the future, the information will be available electronically to the person processing the application.
//6.When the application is completed, it will be submitted to the competent ministry, which will have to reply within a specific time frame which will be defined per application and will be known to the citizen.
//7.A Large Investment Unit will be created at the State Ministry of Citizen Services, which will handle applications whose investments exceed €1 million.
//8.The Unit will be staffed by civil servants seconded from the ministries or authorities competent to handle such requests.
//Officials will have all the powers from their Ministry to decide on applications to the Major Investment Unit except those of the Minister.
//9.Each application to the Large Investment Unit will have a Project Manager whose responsibility it will be to process and approve or reject the application within a specific timeframe which will be known to the natural or legal person.
//10.ALL decisions of the Major Investment Unit will be available on the internet in order to ensure the reliability and correctness of the decision.
//11.The Council of Ministers will be able to use the Major Investment Unit to implement its own decisions.
//12.Each ministry will create an Application Processing Department which will have the responsibility, within a certain period of time, to approve or reject the application of the natural or legal person.
//The Processing Department will transfer and train people who will be able to handle cases other than their own and other departments of each ministry.
//13.The Reform Commissioner will evaluate the procedures and make proposals in accordance with his/her powers and duties in order to avoid unnecessary costs for both the public and the private sector.
//as well as from the private sector
//and decisions to be adopted within a reasonable period of time.
Cyprus
New Assertive Strategy
The codified document outlines the 62-page Citizens' Alliance Strategy Proposal, prepared by experts, academics, internationalists and diplomats.
The Proposal analyses the long-standing Turkish objectives in Cyprus and then sets out the objectives and tactics that the Republic of Cyprus must follow in order to achieve freedom from occupation.
The document sets out in detail the pillars, philosophy and objectives of the new Strategy proposed by the Civic Alliance.
J. TURKEY'S STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IN CYPRUS
//Dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus
//Creation of a disguised Confederation
//Ensuring the existence of a non-functional State in paralysis
//imposing a logic of "sovereignty partition", through which to ensure that in the event of a divorce, thetwo 'constituent states' would retain sovereignty over their respective geographical territories
// Altering the demographic character of the island with the prospect of dehumanisation
// Turkey seeks full strategic control of Cyprus
// and using it as a Trojan horse in the EU to promote its own interests.
J. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
//Liberation
//End of occupation and partition
//Restoration of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus
//Restoration of human rights for all legal citizens of the State
//Withdrawal of all foreign troops //Withdrawal
of settlers
//The Cyprus solution cannot be a strategic goal in itself, but a means to the strategic goal.
J. A NEW STRATEGY FOR CYPRIOTS
//For the effective planning and implementation of a strategy and the Cyprus issue
//and more broadly for the security and survival of the Republic of Cyprus,
//it is extremely important to achieve a high degree of consensus among the political forces on the following:
//The policy pursued by the Greek side over the last 43 years has not had the desired result.
//The non-solution of the Cyprus problem is solely due to Turkish intransigence and the goals that Turkey wants to achieve through the solution.
//Continuation of the current policy will either lead to a new deadlock and perpetuation of the division,
// or to a Turkish solution.
//In order to achieve a solution, we will have to satisfy all Turkey's demands under the current circumstances (when the solution will not be the one we want),
//or we should force Turkey to change its policy and abandon its extreme demands and its intransigent attitude.
//In order for Turkey to change its policy on the Cyprus problem, we will have to, either through our policy, influence its other strategic objectives by making them unattainable - that is, create serious political costs for Turkey.
//we need to change the attitude of the international community (USA, EU) towards the occupation and Turkey,
//we can turn the Turkish Cypriot community against the Turkish policy.
Key conditions that must underpin an integrated security strategy: Established strategic planning.
//Development and expansion of alliances with more powerful states;
//A multi-level foreign policy that will maximise the benefits that the Republic of Cyprus can gain in those areas where it enjoys an advantage, such as EU membership
; //Acceleration of the exploitation of the energy resources located in the Cypriot EEZ and energy infrastructure;
//The national interests of the Republic of Cyprus require the resolution of the Cyprus problem as soon as possible.
// However, this can no longer be understood beyond and outside the wider regional context, which places our national issue in a relationship of interaction and interdependence with issues such as:
//The EU's policies and needs in our region
//The new state of affairs in the EU after Brexit
//The new role and interests of the US in the region
//Russia's interests and aspirations in the region
//Regional convergences and divergences of interests that are forming between actors such as Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, etc.
//The Kurdish factor and the prospects for a Kurdish state in the region after the fight against the so-called Islamic State
Five Pillars of Strategy
Philosophy of the New Strategy
//The new Strategy must: a.Make the continued occupation of Cypriot territories unprofitable for Turkey.
//b.Make other strategic objectives of Turkey unfeasible.
//c.Convince the EU
//and the US that no solution to the Cyprus problem will negatively affect their own interests.
//d.To lead Great Britain to a change of policy on the Cyprus problem.
//e.To make the Cyprus problem a truly European issue.
//f.To integrate the quality of the Cyprus solution into the logic of security and stability of the region.
The axes of the New Strategy Defending and strengthening the Republic of Cyprus
//Economic strengthening,
// Defence and Diplomacy
//Use of the status of Member State of the European Union
//Suspension of Turkey's accession process in case of non-implementation of Ankara's Cyprus obligations
//Rejection of EU-Turkey Preferential Relationship without a solution to the Cyprus problem
//Steady blocking of European funds from Turkey
//Creating incentives for the US, EU, UK
//and Turkish Cypriots
//Common planning and Action Plan with Greece, without abolishing the principle of autonomy
Strategic Objective
//Our strategic objective in relation to the Cyprus problem is Liberation,
//is the end of the occupation and partition,
//the restoration of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus
//and human rights for all legitimate citizens of the State
//and the withdrawal of all foreign troops and settlers.
Ways of achieving the objective
//Finalisation of the Defence Cooperation Agreement with France
//Signature of a similar agreement with Russia
//Establishment of a Leadership Development Centre under the auspices of the United Nations.
//Objective to promote the Republic of Cyprus as a positive and active factor of stability in the region
//Cooperation with Israel and Jewish Lobby to cover common interests such as: security of energy infrastructure,
//ensuring Israel's strategic depth in exchange for the provision of military technology,
//development of high-tech infrastructure in Cyprus
//establishment of cooperation with the Arab World as well
//acceleration of the procedures for the creation of a Hydrogenation Terminal
//establishment of a National Security Council
//development of the Knowledge Economy
Objectives
1.Survival of Cypriot Hellenism
//The solution must ensure the national, political, cultural and economic survival of Cypriot Hellenism.
Principles and Ways
//The Republic of Cyprus to continue to be the State of Cyprus after the solution;
//Removal of settlers
//and ensuring that there are no provisions in the solution that would allow legal or illegal future alteration of the demographic character of the island.
2.Serving the interests of the legitimate citizens of the Republic of Cyprus
Principles and Ways
//The solution must be workable and the decision-making processes must be effective and not lead to deadlock and friction;
//This can be achieved by respecting and applying the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
//There should be no guarantor powers
//and no recognition of interventionist rights over Cyprus to any country.
//Full withdrawal of all Turkish occupying troops.
//The state should have the means to provide security for its citizens and infrastructure
//as well as the capacity to defend its territorial integrity. //The
national identity, culture, language and religion of each community shall be preserved by establishing an educational system up to secondary education on a community basis,
//while higher education shall be state-run.
//All human rights and democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed for all legal citizens,
//without discrimination and restrictions. //The
unity of space, institutions, economy and society must be ensured;
//The solution must allow for the development of common economic interests (even common economic and social problems),
//as well as common political and/or trade union action.
3.An effective and active state within the European Union
Principles and Ways
//There should be effective decision-making procedures that will allow the Republic of Cyprus to formulate timely positions and proposals on all issues of concern to the EU
//The Republic of Cyprus should be free to decide on the use of its infrastructure for serving common European objectives or operations
//The solution should be fully harmonised with the principles of European law.
4.Restoration of the Cyprus issue as an issue of invasion and occupation
//It is a common assessment that the Cyprus problem is now being treated or tends to turn from an issue of invasion and occupation into a bicommunal dispute.//In
order to restore the Cyprus problem to its character as an issue of invasion and occupation, it is not enough for us to make statements or to inform the international community.
//The international community knows about the invasion and occupation, but chooses to ignore it in order to serve other geopolitical and geostrategic purposes.
//With this strategy, its tactics and the tools for its implementation, the Cyprus problem is regaining its true character and nature as an issue of invasion and occupation.
// The tactics of "parallel and simultaneous negotiations" with Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community, the "final timetable with pre-decided sanctions", the intervention in the "EU-NATO cooperation" etc. place Turkey at the centre of the ferment and lead to a shift in the centre of gravity of the European, American and international factor's attention to Turkey and its responsibilities.
ALLIANCE OF CITIZENS
POLITICAL COMPROMISE OF PRINCIPLES
//The Republic of Cyprus, its defence and strengthening, is a basic prerequisite for the natural and national survival of the Hellenic Cypriots.
//Cyprus today has entered a critical path of testing which may prove to be long and fatal.
//The state and the citizens face huge problems and challenges that affect the present and the future.
//The Eurogroup decision of 25 March 2013 and the Memorandum that the Government agreed with the Troika have changed the character of Cyprus, the structure of the economy, the cohesion of society and the way of life of Cypriot citizens.
//The Memorandum leads to a deep and lasting recession, to the economic dependence of the Republic of Cyprus
// and social misery.
//With the Cyprus problem open,
//Economic dependence and weakening poses risks.
//The solution of the Cyprus problem on terms that satisfy Turkey,
//the control of energy resources
//and the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus is the great stake of the developments that have been planned and initiated by the known decision centres.
//The Memorandum is the tool that limits State Sovereignty
//and imposes on Cyprus the new model of economic and political colonialism, in a period of redrawing the geopolitical map of the Eastern Mediterranean.
//The disruption and weakening of relations with Russia weakens the position of the Republic of Cyprus in the international environment at a critical phase when it will need allies, especially in the UN Security Council.
The solution of the Cyprus problem
//The Cyprus problem was created by Turkish expansionism and perpetuated by Turkish intransigence.
//The current situation and partition, in whatever form and shape, is unjust and dangerous, and is therefore not an option.
//The resolution of the Cyprus problem is the basic precondition for Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Armenians, Maronites and Latins to live in peace,
// in conditions of freedom, security and prosperity in a Free and Common Homeland
// enjoying all human rights and democratic freedoms equally,
// without racial discrimination and exclusion.
//To be meaningful, the solution to the Cyprus problem must overturn the facts of the invasion and occupation and not legitimize them or be based on them.
//The solution should be inspired by modern democratic principles,
//Human rights,
//European law
//and the expectations of the young people who will experience and apply it.
//The solution should allow all legal citizens of the Republic of Cyprus to move and settle freely in any corner of Cyprus they choose.
//Have the right to own and work in any area they want to live in
// and to exercise the democratic freedoms of suffrage and election where they live and work.
//The two communities can live together in mixed villages and towns and not separately in two neighbouring 'Component States'.
//The solution of the Cyprus problem should give continuity to the Republic of Cyprus.
//Any solution that leads to the dissolution or contestation of the Republic of Cyprus is a trap and cannot be accepted.
// As important as it is to find a solution, it is even more important that the next day of the solution leads to political stability, security and economic prosperity and not to deadlocks and new frictions.
//For this to happen, the solution must be functional, which requires the political system to function according to the rules of democracy
// and not with dysfunctional provisions that numerically equate 18% of the population with 82% on a racist and dichotomous basis.
//The violation of the principles and rules of democracy will lead to deadlocks and paralysis of the State and the collapse of the solution.
//The Republic of Cyprus should be free of foreign troops and settlers.
//It should be truly Independent and Sovereign over the whole geographical area of the island.
//To have one and indivisible sovereignty, one international entity.
// Guarantees, interventionist rights and foreign military bases are remnants of a colonial system and must be ended.
//International law and the European acquis are the only framework that ensures a just and viable solution.
//Since 1974 the international environment has changed completely.
//Adherence and fixation to the goals and data of the time is both counterproductive and dangerous.
/ / A review and adaptation of objectives and strategy to the new data and circumstances is required.
//Cooperation with Greece should be upgraded, covering all sectors and based on a common and integrated strategy.
//The policy of unilateral concessions is bankrupt and has led the Cyprus problem to dangerous models of solution.
//Satisfaction of Turkish demands did not lead to Turkey's rationalization but encouraged its intransigence.
//The process of intercommunal talks has proven to be both ineffective and damaging.
//This process allowed Turkey to change the character of the Cyprus problem, transforming it from a problem of invasion and occupation to a problem of distribution of powers between the two communities.
//In order to create conditions and conditions for a just solution, the policy of unilateral concessions must be abandoned.
//An assertive strategy must be formulated and pursued, with the conclusion of strategic alliances that strengthen the Republic of Cyprus.
//For there to be a solution, Turkey must be forced to change its policy.
//Without a change in Turkish policy there will either be no solution or the solution will be of Turkish specifications.
//Turkey will not change its policy as long as its demands are met.
//Ankara will change its policy when the political cost it pays for the occupation is greater than the benefit it gets from the occupation.
//This is why the opportunities offered to the Republic of Cyprus by its membership of the European Union must be exploited
// but also the opportunities provided by Turkey's will to join the European family or to have a privileged relationship with the Union.
//The unilateral concessions of the Greek side over time have violated every line of security and survival for the Greek Cypriots.
//The continuation of the talks on the basis of the so-called convergences does not lead to a solution but to the destruction of the Republic of Cyprus
//and the gradual dehumanization of Cyprus through a legal settlement.
//This is why the withdrawal of all the time-long concessions of the Greek Cypriot side is necessary
//and the formulation of a new framework for a solution in line with new international standards and conditions.
// We must also abandon models invented by the British, such as the Bi-zonal,
// leading to the dissolution of the state and to a covert partition.
//The Bi-zonal, which was first given a specific content with the Annan Plan, presupposes geographical division and separation of citizens on an ethnic basis, racist discrimination
//and the abolition of human rights and democratic freedoms for Cypriot Hellenism.
//The intercommunal talks as a process for the resolution of the Cyprus problem must be replaced by a new process which will lead Turkey to face its responsibilities and highlight the Cyprus problem as a problem of invasion and occupation.
/ / / Parallel and simultaneous negotiation must be pursued.
//At the same time and simultaneously negotiate with both the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.
//With the Turkish Cypriots, the negotiation should be about securing their rights and freedoms through the solution.
//Negotiations with Turkey must cover the issues of the withdrawal of occupying troops, settlers, the abolition of guarantees and any interventionist rights.
//Turkey's refusal to engage in negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus should imply a suspension of its accession path to the European Union.
Economy and Social State
//The economic crisis Cyprus is experiencing is the worst since the Turkish invasion.
//The social cost of the crisis is huge: tens of thousands of unemployed people are deprived of the opportunity to realize their dreams,
// Families and pensioners are forced to resort to social soup kitchens to secure food,
//Young scientists are forced to seek employment in foreign countries, depriving Cyprus of their dynamism and knowledge.
//Small and medium-sized enterprises are driven to shrink their turnover and to stop operating,
// while all development investment has been terminated.
//Cyprus' integration into the logic and philosophy of the Troika undermines the prospect of growth and leads to a deep economic recession.
//Cyprus' credibility as a financial services centre has been irreparably damaged.
//Cypriot businesses and the banking sector are in conditions of uncertainty and insecurity.
//In the new economic environment created by the Eurogroup decision and the Troika's Memorandum, the country must restore the Financial System
//and to strengthen it while imposing strict control and transparency mechanisms.
// It is imperative for Cyprus to escape as soon as possible from the recessionary commitments of the Memorandum and this can be done through an integrated development strategy
//and the immediate exploitation of part of the F.A. deposits.
//Cyprus needs a more balanced development so that there is no overdependence of the economy on one sector.
//Sustainable development should make maximum use of the renewable energy sources that Cyprus' weather conditions favour.
//Cyprus' economic model, which successfully led the country to the beginning of the 21st century, following the decision of the Eurogroup, needs to be revised and adapted to the new data.
/ / / It is necessary to design a new economic model which, in addition to the services sector
//must include development of the productive sector.
//The service sector needs modernisation and enrichment to continue to be competitive.
//At the same time, it is necessary to create the necessary conditions for the creation of a high-tech industry.
//Use the country's scientific personnel,
//The advantages and new possibilities that Natural Gas will offer us.
//Research and innovation must be the main priority and axis for the new model of economic development.
/ / It is necessary to create a comprehensive incentive plan for foreign investment in all sectors,
// with emphasis on export-oriented production activities.
//Cyprus must preserve the Social State, which is a basic element of its political culture and tradition.
//But for the state to be able to offer high quality social support services to vulnerable social groups,
//must have a strong and healthy economy.
//To be effective, social benefits must be offered only to people who need the help and assistance of the state.
//Social Justice must be the quintessence of the State.
//The concept of Social Justice and Social Solidarity is of particular value in the current circumstances where the social fabric has been torn apart.
//The distribution of the burden of the recession must be fair
//and done in a way that ensures that every family has the minimum resources for a decent living.
//The right to free education
// and health care under the General Health Plan must be guaranteed as a matter of urgency.
//The State must be reformed to make it more productive, more efficient and more citizen-friendly
//but also to private initiatives for growth.
//The state established and organized on the basis of the 1960s conditions does not respond to the environment of the 21st century and the needs of today's society.
/ / It is necessary to make maximum use of the possibilities provided by modern technology for the simplification of State procedures
//and an end to costly bureaucracy
//and makes economic growth more difficult.
//The size and cost of the state apparatus must be in harmony with the size of society and the economy.
//The structural problems that lead to large budget deficits and a steady increase in public debt must be addressed through modern structural changes and reforms.
//This is the only way to ensure the necessary fiscal stability needed to put growth on a firm footing.
// These changes should be based on a medium-term planning
//but also with social sensitivity.
//The increase in state revenues must come primarily from growth
// and not by raising or imposing new taxes.
//The tax system and the control mechanisms of the state must be modernized to be effective and protect society.
//The control over the banking system must be tightened in order to avoid repeating the mistakes that are currently plaguing society and the economy.
// The cooperation and development of joint ventures between the public and private sectors is the modern way of economic progress with low costs and high productivity.
//Cyprus urgently needs an integrated and balanced migration policy that is consistent with its development objectives,
// its potential for the smooth integration of migrants
// and the size of the society.
Modern and Democratic State
//Cyprus is currently experiencing a deep crisis of institutions and values.
//The political system has been discredited in the eyes of the citizens.
//Radical changes are needed to regain the trust of citizens.
//Recruitment, promotion and public procurement procedures must be fully transparent.
//It is also necessary to define specific procedures of social-public control, allowing citizens to have a meaningful role and participation in governance.
//The role of citizens must be active.
//In order for Cyprus to move to a higher level of organization and development, the utilization of all citizens, regardless of party or ideological affiliation, is required.
//The urgency of the moment demands that anachronistic concepts that lead to the exclusion of capable people be rejected.
//The only criterion should be the value, the ability and the will of the citizens to contribute to the public and not the party identity.
//The culture of partisanship of the State and all social institutions is destructive and degrades the dignity of citizens.
//The concept of personal civil and criminal liability must be introduced at all levels of civil power and public administration.
//The culture of impunity is the source of financial scandals and corruption, which is why it must be replaced by the principle of zero tolerance
// and transparency.
//The continuous democratisation of our political system is a social demand.
//Politicians must be accountable to citizens throughout their term of office and not only during the election period.
//Democracy is not exhausted at the moment of voting.
//The sovereignty of the people must be permanent in order to control the political figures in the implementation of the Social Contract on the basis of which they have secured the trust and the vote of the citizens.
//And this can be achieved by implementing the Recall Principle, which gives citizens the right and power to recall their elected representatives (President of the Republic, Members of Parliament, Mayors, etc.) through democratic procedures.
//Only with the continuous deepening of democracy,
// the continuous expansion of citizens' rights,
//continuously enhancing the role of citizens, the vision of participatory democracy will be realised.
//To keep alive the interest of citizens in political events
//and there will be active participation in the political process, reversing the trend of abstention.
//These principles should be an integral part of education which should cultivate national consciousness,
// love for the homeland,
// commitment to the principles and ideals of democracy.
European Union
//The accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the EU has upgraded the prestige and strengthened the international entity of the state.
/ / It is necessary to upgrade the role and value of Cyprus within the EU, exploiting its geostrategic position for the benefit of the European Union.
//The experience of the Eurogroup decision of 25 March 2013, but also the way Greece and other countries of the European South are treated by the EU, raises many questions as to the real principles and values that govern the functioning of the Union.
//It is obvious that Germany is claiming a hegemonic role in the European Union at the expense of other partners and Community solidarity.
//Germany's behaviour proves that narrow national economic interests are imposed at the expense of common European principles and visions.
//Continuation of this behaviour will endanger the European Union and the good of peace that prevailed in Europe after the Second World War and was anchored in the development of common interests.
//The functioning of the Eurogroup has demonstrated the great gaps that exist in the creation of a common currency without the creation of a common state.
//Serving political and national agendas has undermined the prospect of the Euro.
//Cyprus should seriously and thoroughly study alternative options, including a return to the National Currency of the Pound.
STATEMENT BY ANDREAS APOSTOLOU, HEAD OF POLITICAL PLANNING
The necessity of increasing maternity and paternity leave in the new socio-economic conditions
//Following an initiative of the Citizens' Alliance, the discussion of the issue we have registered, on increasing maternity and paternity leave, started yesterday in the Labour Committee of the Parliament.
//We are particularly pleased that our proposal is in agreement with the women's organisations present at the meeting.
//At a time when we are facing a serious problem of low birth rate
//and a prolonged economic crisis that forces both parents to work exhausting hours, the state must stand by the Cypriot family;
//for this reason, it is imperative that we move swiftly to increase maternity and paternity leave, overcoming any legal or financial obstacles.
//If, therefore, the budget for the implementation of the proposal cannot be cut from the social security funds because there may be a question of the viability of the social security fund, then resources can be found so that it can be covered by the state in another way.
//Young mothers have rights to be able to have children and continue to work. //They
should be able to raise a healthy family and continue their careers unhindered.
//So let us focus on the future of our country and put numbers aside and look first at the issue of survival and development of our people.
//We need to finally develop a welfare state.
//As a Citizens' Alliance we will continue to work until we achieve an increase in maternity and paternity leave.

COALITION OF CITIZENS' PROPOSALS ON HEALTH
//Priority for the Civic Alliance is to ensure that ALL citizens, regardless of their financial means, have access to high quality health services.
//Health is a supreme good for every human being and should be treated as such by a modern state.
//The Cypriot citizen currently pays over 50% of annual health care costs out of his/her pocket, unlike other European citizens who pay less than 5-10%.
//Event, which takes away families' finances,
//leading many of our compatriots to economic ruin, and dramatically reducing the economic possibilities of citizens fact
//which, apart from its humanitarian implications, has a negative impact on the development of the Cypriot economy.
//The only solution in our view is the IMMEDIATE radical reform of the health system.

//The rapid ageing of the population in Cyprus has begun to reveal the substantial problems that the Third Age has been facing for decades.
