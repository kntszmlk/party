CHP, THE PARTY OF HARD TIMES
Turkey is at a turning point...
As our country moves towards the November 1, 2015 General Election, Turkey's problems are growing.
Those who are trying to use all of Turkey's resources for their personal interests are putting our country in a bottleneck,
conflict
and they're driving it into a great depression.
Those who on June 7 could not digest the national will;
those who do not want to share power at any cost;
those who are not sincere, those who behave sincerely;
Those who cannot show the courage shown by the CHP, which puts "Turkey first" and does not negotiate for any position;
those who have left the country without a government at this difficult time for the sake of their personal calculations;
Those who destabilize Turkey;
It destroys all the values that make Turkey what it is.
This declaration is the call of the party of hard times, the Republican People's Party.
Only the Republican People's Party can lead Turkey out of these difficult times.
Because great challenges can only be overcome by a will that has courage, a back to lean on and a strong history to guide it.
The CHP is the only political party with such a historical legacy.
TURKEY IN CRISIS
There is a crisis in almost every aspect of our social life.
The Republican People's Party is committed to solving five important problems that lie at the root of these crises
and stabilize our country,
to peace
and prosperity.
SOCIAL CONFLICT AND THE KURDISH QUESTION
Under AKP rule, discrimination, marginalization and polarization have left their mark on every aspect of our daily lives.
"Prejudice, hatred and hatred" have reached dimensions that threaten social peace and the desire to live together.
AKP is separating society, dividing it into camps.
The ruling party is deepening the ideological and cultural divisions in society to protect its own political interests.
It tries to overcome every problem it faces by creating bigger problems and crises.
Constant escalation of tensions paves the way for conflicts.
Conflict and fighting now affect every aspect of society.
The AKP is solely responsible for this picture.
The AKP tried to solve the Kurdish problem behind closed doors, by smuggling it out of the Parliament, without democratic legitimacy.
It empowered those with guns.
It has eroded politics in parliament.
He acted with the hidden agenda of passing the presidential system.
It ran away from creating a strong legal infrastructure for a solution.
Instead of solving the Kurdish problem, the AKP has deepened it.
When the AKP's secret calculations failed, terrorism resumed in a much more violent form.
Social peace and tranquillity are in greater danger than ever before.
Every day our young people are martyred.
Every day the fratricidal strife deepens.
The streets are no longer under the rule of law.
The gun has taken precedence over politics.
Violence makes people from different walks of life unable to talk to each other.
Our society is going through a great crisis.
COUP LAW AND THE PROBLEM OF AUTHORITARIANISM
Turkey is a country where the Constitution has been suspended,
that the political system is unknown,
where decisions are made in palaces,
The state as a whole is going through a period of eroding legitimacy.
The eagerness to establish a one-man regime is eroding all the rules of the system.
Authoritarian regime destroys Turkey's stability.
The law is silent in the face of power.
Arbitrariness is increasing.
Courthouses, which should be the voice of right and law in the face of power, are becoming a tool of oppression for the powerful.
Injustice pervades every aspect of social life.
The law is silent; the gun speaks.
The law is silent; theft and corruption pervade the system.
The law is silent; repression is increasing.
The law remains silent; the oppressors become untouchable, the oppressed helpless.
Politics and democracy are going through a crisis.
FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEM
Turkey is becoming more and more isolated.
A foreign policy that has fallen into the traps of sectarianism, adventurism and bravado is creating enemies, not friends.
Turkey is becoming a source of instability in its region.
Our country is grappling with the political, economic and humanitarian repercussions of international crises, the genesis and deepening of which the ruling party is responsible for.
Turkey is moving away from the West, to which it has historically gravitated.
It is drifting into stormy seas with no direction, no compass.
Turkey is abandoning its democratic allies, whose systems are based on human rights and freedoms.
It is becoming synonymous with some Middle Eastern regimes that are authoritarian, sectarian and survived by intelligence organizations.
Our foreign policy is going through a crisis.
ECONOMIC PROBLEM
Turkey's economy is alarming.
Our economy is no longer standing still, it is going backwards.
Our 17 million poor
and 6 million unemployed are increasing, not decreasing.
The Turkish Lira is losing value every day.
Entrepreneurs cannot see ahead.
Investors are fleeing the country.
Turkey is falling behind in the global race.
Turkey is not growing.
Turkey cannot produce.
Turkey cannot create jobs.
Income distribution in Turkey is deteriorating.
While citizens are dealing with these problems, while our people are worried about the future of their children, those in power are wasting our resources.
While our citizens are oppressed in mines, construction sites, fields and shipyards, those who are rich from politics live in palaces, mansions and mansions.
State resources are poured into pools.
Resources vital for Turkey's future are being lost in a quagmire of corruption.
The rent-oriented, one-way economic growth model, based on consumption without production, is preventing Turkey from achieving its great goals.
Turkey is skidding in the middle income and middle technology trap, losing precious time.
Our economy is going through a crisis.
EDUCATION PROBLEM
For the future of our democracy,
for social tolerance to flourish,
for our economy to transition to a knowledge economy
and for us to compete with the world
Our vital education system is paralyzed.
Problems in education darken our future.
No parent is satisfied with the education system, which has changed 13 times in the last 12 years.
All parents in our country are worried about the future of their children.
Public schools are left to their own fate, students are forced to attend schools they do not want to attend.
Good and quality education is becoming the privilege of a very small minority of well-off people.
Poor quality education condemns the children of the poor to poverty.
Thousands of teachers are waiting without staff.
The world of science and university administrations are under pressure.
Universities are being turned into local organizations of the AKP.
Our graduates cannot find jobs.
An education system that prioritizes dogma over inquiry, obedience over democracy and free thought, monism over pluralism, endangers the future of our democracy.
Our education system is going through a crisis.
MAJOR TRANSFORMATION TARGETS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS
Turkey needs a major transformation.
Turkey needs the realization of the "great transformation goals" that the CHP insists on.
Turkey needs a political cadre with the vision and courage to lead our country out of the current crisis.
Turkey needs the CHP.
Turkey's problems are deep, but Turkey is not helpless.
Because there is the Republican People's Party.
CHP FOR SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND SOLUTIONS
CHP will put an end to the politics of polarization that divides and conflicts our society.
Under CHP rule, the methods of "suspicion, labeling and threats" that foster a culture of tension will be replaced by democratic methods such as "dialogue, empathy and persuasion".
There will be no politics based on ethnic identity, belief and lifestyle, and no one will be marginalized because of their identity.
In order to ensure social peace, the Kurdish issue must be resolved as soon as possible.
CHP is determined to remove the violence and conflict that has led to the deaths of thousands of people from Turkey's agenda.
The state will establish security, which is its fundamental duty,
but it will do so with full respect for human rights and without opening new wounds.
CHP will be sincere and honest to solve the problem and will not act according to a hidden agenda.
It will not engage in engagements that cannot be explained to society.
The solution will be achieved through peaceful methods, on parliamentary grounds, in a transparent, lawful manner and with social consensus.
The solution will be based on a libertarian and pluralist democracy and an understanding of equal citizenship.
CHP promises our citizens a Turkey where no one will ever pick up a gun again.
CHP FOR FIRST CLASS DEMOCRACY
that strengthens the parliamentary system, enshrines the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law, and a
Turkey needs a libertarian constitution
first-class democracy.
It needs reforms to bring the presidency within the limits defined by the parliamentary system against authoritarianism that has effectively suspended the constitution.
To achieve this, coup laws must be abolished.
Legal regulations that will bring rights and freedoms to universal standards must be implemented.
Those who came to power by saying "we will come to terms with the coups" are today utilizing all the oppressive tools of the coup law to maintain their power.
CHP will erase the putschist institutions and rules from our legal system and put an end to the power of those who benefit from the coup order.
CHP will restructure the HSYK.
It will guarantee the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
CHP will take all necessary measures to establish a qualified judiciary whose main objective is the protection of human rights.
CHP will promote first-class democracy by expanding freedoms;
by establishing pluralism;
by strengthening the parliamentary system;
by making parliamentary oversight mechanisms effective;
by ensuring the true independence and impartiality of the judiciary;
by raising the quality of the judicial order;
by strengthening civil society;
by supporting organizing;
by continuing to insist on secularism;
not by fighting the press, but by fighting those who try to silence the press;
by making transparency pervasive at all levels of government;
by putting a culture of reconciliation in opposition to the language of fighting that is trying to dominate politics;
by defending women's rights together with women.
The TGNA will be the place where a libertarian and pluralist democracy, the rule of law and an order based on human rights will be built.
The Parliament that led the War of Independence should also be the center of Turkey's re-establishment with a vision of rights, freedoms and the rule of law.
The palace of democracy in Turkey is the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
Turkey does not need other palaces.
CHP FOR PEACE IN THE WORLD
CHP is committed to transforming our foreign policy from a crisis to a realistic and peaceful one,
secular,
respectful of international law
and its main objective is the security of our citizens.
and with policies to improve its welfare.
Pacifism is one of the most important goals that our founder Atatürk set for us by saying "peace at home, peace in the world".
No step will be taken to draw Turkey into a hot conflict, unless it is in its vital national interests.
The European orientation of our foreign policy will be maintained.
Being part of a Europe based on democracy, human rights and a social state and working to strengthen it will be the primary goal of our foreign policy.
Our foreign policy will be shaped on the basis of realism.
There will be no room for adventurism, hamas, dogmatic and ideological obsessions, irresponsible behavior due to domestic political concerns in foreign policy.
Secularism will also dominate foreign policy and Turkey will be prevented from slipping dangerously into sectarianism.
In foreign policy, the approach that tries to do everything at the same time and fails to achieve positive results in any area will be rejected.
A well-prioritized approach that respects the courtesy of diplomatic life will be emphasized.
The goal of our foreign policy is not to serve the international connections and ideological friendships of the ruling minority, but to ensure the security of the citizens of the Republic of Turkey.
and prosperity.
CHP FOR A DEVELOPING TURKEY
Exit from the economic crisis, restoration of the rule of law,
development of creative and innovative sectors,
The knowledge economy depends on the realization of the educational breakthroughs on which it will rise.
Supporting the producers,
that resources are not squandered on corruption,
It depends on the creation of an equal and fair competitive environment for entrepreneurs.
It depends on social assistance being provided as a right, not as a means to garner votes.
It depends on a vision that sees social policies not as an electoral investment but as an investment in Turkey's future.
CHP is the party that reproduces our economy
and fair sharing, and will bring Turkey out of the crisis.
CHP focuses on employment
will realize a development thrust.
CHP will take our country out of the middle income and middle technology trap.
It will increase added value in production and Turkey's international competitiveness.
CHP will spread prosperity to the grassroots and establish social justice.
Under CHP rule, the Turkish economy will cease to be a crawling economy based on sectors that produce low added value and will become an innovative economy based on creative sectors.
Economic policies will promote production, not rent.
Investments based on public-private partnerships, such as the CHP's "Central Turkey" project, will ensure that the CHP's economic vision is realized as quickly as possible.
CHP FOR YOUNG PEOPLE READY FOR THE FUTURE
Countries where people with the skills required by the age produce high value-added products and prosper.
In Turkey, our per capita income has not increased for a long time.
Our country cannot produce high value-added products.
Because our education system is inadequate.
For the future of our democracy,
In order for our economy to transition to a knowledge economy and compete with the world
The problems of our education system must be solved.
An equal, free, scientific, quality and inquisitive education system must be established.
Teaching our national values
But a curriculum that is in line with universal realities and values must be created.
CHP will implement an education reform that will realize these goals.
CHP will establish an education system that teaches our children not rote memorization but questioning and develops their analytical and social skills.
It will improve the physical capacities of our schools so that our children can receive a modern and qualified education.
It will ensure that our education system provides equal opportunities for all.
In CHP government, YÖK will be abolished and financial and administrative autonomy of universities will be ensured.
Universities will be supported according to their needs and scientific achievements, not according to their proximity to the ruling party.
The steps to be taken to ensure the success of these reforms will be determined in consultation with education workers and civil society.
Teachers will receive the value they deserve under the CHP government.
Teachers will be trained as community leaders, and teachers will once again be at the vanguard of social development.
CHP is the party of teachers.
CHP, together with the teachers with whom it laid the foundations of the Republic, is committed to building a democratic society.
and will lay the foundation for the knowledge economy.
CHP IS THE ADDRESS OF SOLUTION AND EXIT FROM CRISIS
Surviving times of crisis requires leadership.
The CHP is the only party that can show the leadership Turkey is looking for these days.
CHP is the party of hard times.
Only the CHP can pull Turkey out of this crisis.
Because the CHP is the only party that has proven its knowledge and foresight on Turkey's problems.
The CHP has always envisioned the truth and spoken the truth.
Now it is time to implement the right policies.
Only CHP can solve Turkey's fundamental problems.
Because leadership in difficult times requires strong character.
Strong character requires being able to defend your values without bending even in the most difficult times.
It requires keeping one's word even in the most difficult times.
CHP is the party that shows this strong character.
CHP is the only political actor in Turkey that says "I will be the unifying force of Turkey" and can talk to all segments of society.
It is the one that says "CHP for everyone" and keeps its promise to defend the rights of all, regardless of whether they vote for it or not.
The CHP is the only political actor that says "Neither oppressor nor oppressed, a just and humane order" and keeps its promise to stand by the laborers, the oppressed and the excluded.
CHP is Atatürk's party.
It is the party of those who put an end to the Sultanate, of those who called for a Republic, of those who closed one era and opened another.
It is the party of those who, despite all kinds of oppression, knew how to keep the country out of the world war.
It is the party of those who know how to give up power for democracy.
CHP is the party of those who resist coups.
The CHP is the party that no coup, no coup plotter, no reign enthusiast has been able to remove from the hearts of this people, even though it has been shut down in coups, its property confiscated, its executives imprisoned, its archives burned and its hands tied.
CHP is the party of hard times.
The CHP now promises to pull Turkey out of the crisis.
FREEDOM, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY
CHP supports the consolidation of freedoms, democracy and the rule of law in our country,
to realize social justice,
to ensure economic development
and sees it as the basic condition for achieving an information society.
Achieving these goals is only possible if democratic values and the rule of law are fully embedded at the institutional and moral level.
The biggest threat to democracy and the rule of law in Turkey is the AKP government, which seeks to monopolize politics and the state with the claim of acting on behalf of the national will.
The monopolization of power has led to the usurpation of checks and balances.
The AKP government has established a system that imposes lawlessness under the guise of legality, arbitrariness under the guise of governing the state, and rent sharing under the guise of development.
CHP has defended constitutional principles and institutions on the one hand and human rights and freedoms on the other with great conviction and courage against all these unlawfulness, violations and oppression.
Against an authoritarian regime in Turkey, there is a need for a new understanding of democracy that guarantees the rule of law, citizens' rights and institutional autonomy.
The separation of powers against an oppressive regime in Turkey,
There is a need for a new political understanding that will defend pluralism and a culture of peaceful coexistence.
Turkey has come to the point of resolutely embracing freedom and democracy against a government that oppresses individuals, society and constitutional institutions.
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND RULE OF LAW
Executive oversight is an indispensable principle of democracy and the rule of law.
In order to safeguard this principle, the control of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (TBMM) over the executive must be complete and flawless.
The TGNA is an inalienable and irreducible reflection of the will of the nation.
The CHP will strengthen the powers of the Parliament vis-à-vis the executive and ensure that its checks and balances functions are fully realized.
CHP will not allow the national will to be sacrificed for the special interests of a caste, a circle of interests, a leader or a family.
It will put an end to domestic and foreign policy decisions concerning Turkey's future being taken behind closed doors and in secret negotiations, evading the Parliament.
CHP will strengthen the Parliament, the most important institution of our Republic and democracy, by upholding the essence of the principle of separation of powers.
CHP will prevent the transformation of the Parliament into a one-party parliament, the government into a one-man government and the state into a one-party state through amendments to the TBMM Rules of Procedure and the Law on Political Parties.
The electoral threshold, a remnant of the military coup, will be lowered, paving the way for political pluralism in Parliament.
It will be ensured that the Grand National Assembly is the main safeguard against the danger of monist power.
The CHP believes that a balanced and controlled democracy is only possible through political pluralism and institutional autonomy.
The CHP will put an end to the undermining of the legitimacy of the elections.
It will ensure that all elections in Turkey are held in a free and fair manner, and prevent election processes from becoming shady.
It will prevent the partisan use of public resources and personnel to influence election results.
CHP assures all our citizens that all elections will be free and fair.
The most important force against absolute and arbitrary tendencies to power is the principle of the rule of law.
The rule of law, together with the right to a fair trial, prevents the law from being used as a weapon against citizens.
The CHP believes that the rule of law has been abolished by a government that deprives the judiciary of its autonomy and manipulates the Constitutional Court and the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors through political interference.
In the CHP government, all political pressures on the judiciary will be eliminated and full independence of the judiciary will be ensured.
In Turkey, the office of the President of the Republic is subject to abuses and excesses of authority at all levels.
The office of the President of the Republic has been deliberately politicized and has gone beyond the job description outlined in the Constitution.
The position and powers of the office of the President, deriving from the constitutional oath, were deliberately violated and the President's irresponsibility was abused.
The executive branch has exceeded the limits of its mandate and has been dragged into a position that violates the law.
Institutions that should be neutral have become symbols of partisanship.
CHP will strengthen the parliamentary system by making the necessary legal arrangements and ensuring the full implementation of the laws.
It will eliminate the extra-legal pressure exerted by the Presidency on the executive, legislature and judiciary.
FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
The CHP's priority is to restore the rule of law and fundamental rights, to end fear and establish a "Republic of Freedom".
The youth, women, laborers and all vulnerable segments of our country must be defended against all oppressive and patriarchal power centers.
Free individuals who claim their rights are the cornerstone of a democratic and developed society.
CHP will empower our citizens and guarantee their freedoms by implementing a politics of rights and freedoms.
The CHP's "politics of rights and freedoms" forms the basis of its understanding of democratic citizenship.
The politics of rights and freedoms is the only form of politics that protects all citizens without discrimination against forms of ethnic, religious, class and sexual domination and envisages solidarity with disadvantaged groups.
CHP defines citizenship not as a symbolic legal status, but as a political opportunity that empowers individuals for democratic transformation and solidarity.
It defines citizenship as the democratic will to govern by people who choose solidarity for a peaceful and democratic future.
The CHP will not marginalize the identities of citizens from the past and will ensure that citizenship rights are carried to the highest level.
It will not allow arbitrary violence and torture against the right to life, bodily integrity, material and moral existence of citizens.
It will end the intimidation of opposition groups;
eliminate all practices that undermine the dignity and privacy of individuals.
It will ensure that the unlawful surveillance and plugging activities carried out by the National Intelligence Organization (MIT), the Telecommunications Communication Presidency (TIB) and the security forces are stopped.
It will end the politics of fear and intimidation practiced on journalists, participants and students.
CHP will ensure that Turkey, whose human rights record is deteriorating, becomes a democracy in line with EU principles and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Impunity has become a principle of governance in Turkey.
In many areas ranging from rights violations to corruption, an administration that is not accountable before the judiciary has become dominant.
Security officers who violate rights should not be allowed to go unpunished.
CHP will ensure that all public practices are brought within legal limits and that violations do not go unpunished.
Preventing impunity is an indispensable precondition for restoring the rule of law in Turkey.
Adopting a social democratic worldview, the CHP argues that political freedom must be complemented by economic freedom to ensure the full freedom of the individual.
He argues that the understanding of democratic citizenship should be supported by the understanding of social citizenship.
CHP is determined to put an end to the current political government's policies of managing poverty instead of fighting it, through the establishment of a strong social state that secures the individual.
CHP is for a fair minimum wage for all citizens, including Family Insurance,
right to social security, right to health
and will pursue the right to education equally and resolutely for all.
It will take all necessary steps to ensure that children, women, the elderly, pensioners and the disabled enjoy social rights comprehensively.
Step by step, the CHP will implement the project of building a new "social democratic civilization" in Turkey.
LAICITY
Our understanding of secularism will be shaped in the light of our understanding of democracy.
The geography we live in and the developments in our country have clearly demonstrated that democracy cannot be secured without secularism and secularism cannot be secured without democracy.
Freedom of religion and conscience will be guaranteed under CHP rule.
Politics and religion will be kept separate and the use of religion in politics will be opposed.
The state will stand at an equal distance to all beliefs and individual preferences, and the Presidency of Religious Affairs will be ensured to act in line with this principle.
The institution will have a pluralistic and inclusive structure and will be kept out of daily politics.
FULL DEMOCRACY AND EQUAL CITIZENSHIP FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE CURD PROBLEM
CHP defends the view that all people are equal regardless of their race, gender, language, religion, sect, thought, place of birth, socio-economic status.
Every human being has fundamental rights and freedoms, including security of life and property, freedom of thought and belief, education and social security.
However, in cases of defamation, insult, violence, racism, discrimination and hate speech, the exercise of rights and freedoms may be limited.
Human rights and freedoms cannot be restricted on the grounds of the will of the majority.
The CHP prioritizes the ideal of equal and free citizenship.
In order to liberate human beings, rights and freedoms must be transformed from abstract legal statuses to realizable ones.
Achieving this goal depends on the state standing at an equal distance to all identities, beliefs and lifestyles.
Aiming to solve the problems in our country on the basis of equality, freedom and justice, CHP also aims to solve the Kurdish problem on the basis of equal citizenship.
and full democracy.
The Kurdish question, one of the most important problems in the history of the Republic, must be understood as a problem of lack of democracy.
What is essential for the solution of the problem is more freedom,
democracy and the rule of law.
This is the only way to lasting peace.
Only in this way can the lives of our citizens be protected
and the welfare of the population improved.
Viewing the Kurdish issue as a purely security problem has led to the rejection of the humanitarian and democratic demands of our citizens.
Wrong practices stemming from a security perspective have led to the intimidation of democratic opposition and repression that has victimized a significant portion of our citizens and damaged their sense of belonging.
Today, there is an environment of violence and terrorism that hurts everyone and has cost the lives of thousands of people.
Violence and terrorism must end immediately
and the issue must be addressed as a historical, social and political problem.
It has become clear that repressive policies, bans, human rights violations and narrow security approaches will not contribute to solving the problem.
Eliminate human rights violations to solve the problem,
widespread unemployment in the region
and a decisive fight against poverty is needed.
The region needs to be rapidly developed socially and economically.
The principle of free and equal citizenship has not been fully realized in practice in our country.
The lack of democracy has led to violations of rights as well as deep suffering that is etched in the memory of our society.
It is necessary to confront the wrong practices of the past, which remain in our collective memory, and their consequences that hurt the people of the region.
Economic understanding of equal citizenship,
emotional disconnections must be ended by making them active in social and cultural spheres.
In this way, the ties of Kurdish citizens with the Republic of Turkey must be strengthened.
The atmosphere of violence and conflict has led to a weakening of trust in the state and the regime in some segments of our society, while in others it has led to the fear that the country will be divided.
Therefore, the sense of insecurity created by an environment of violence must be eliminated.
A broad social consensus must be reached to strengthen the bonds of trust and brotherhood between different segments of our society.
What is needed for a solution is not an approach that focuses solely on security, economic development, human rights, the rule of law or equal citizenship, but a new understanding that encompasses all of these.
CHP is determined to remove violence, conflict and terrorism from Turkey's agenda, which have claimed thousands of lives over the past 30 years, and which still keep our country in a ring of fire, blocking the way to a healthy democracy.
The security dimension of the problem should not be used as a justification for continued human rights violations and lack of democracy.
By developing democratic political mechanisms, we will end a period in which the gun has taken precedence over politics and violence has divided our society.
The CHP promises our citizens a Turkey where no one will ever pick up a gun again.
The two main economic problems of the Southeast and Eastern Anatolia Regions are poverty
and inequality.
CHP is based on a holistic development approach that considers economic problems together with democratization and the development of the rule of law.
Under CHP rule, inequality between regions
and chronic unemployment
and to solve the problems of poverty
large-scale and productive public investments in the region are envisaged.
CHP is the only political party that has prepared region-specific development programs.
The CHP argues that the GAP project should be completed swiftly, taking into account the sustainable development perspective.
CHP's Family Insurance project will end poverty in the region.
Establishment of democracy
and lasting peace
are indispensable prerequisites for boosting the region's economic potential.
CHP is the political party that proposes the most valid method for the solution of the Kurdish problem.
The political world and society should participate in the resolution process in the widest possible way.
The resolution process must be carried out with a democratic and participatory approach.
The CHP has always steadfastly maintained that the most important address for a solution is the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
For a solution, a broad basis for social consensus must be prepared beyond legal and administrative arrangements.
Regarding the methodology of the solution process, CHP proposes the creation of three new institutions.
The first is the establishment of a Social Reconciliation Commission in Parliament with the participation of the political parties represented.
This commission will form the basis for a basic consensus covering all aspects of the problem, including its constitutional dimensions.
The Commission will receive and evaluate the views of the government, political parties and state institutions on the Kurdish question.
The report prepared by the Commission will be submitted to the Plenary Session of Parliament within a period not exceeding one year.
The Commission will task the Common Sense Committee to collect and evaluate the opinions of those who are not represented in the Parliament, NGOs, trade unions and professional chambers on the process.
The Truth Investigation Commission to be established in this context is to confront the past in solving problems,
to create a lasting climate of trust between segments of society,
will carry out the necessary studies and prepare recommendations for the development of a culture of common life.
What is essential for the CHP is to ensure the unity and integrity of our country.
Our unity can only be ensured through a libertarian and pluralist democracy.
This requires ensuring that different identities, beliefs and lifestyles can express themselves and feel free and equal.
Peace to bring a lasting solution to the Kurdish problem,
democracy
and economic dimensions should not be ignored and should be addressed together.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND DEMONSTRATION
In Turkey, especially in the aftermath of the Gezi Movement, practices restricting the right to assembly and demonstration have intensified.
Our citizens have been reduced to the status of "reasonable suspects" and any social post has been turned into potential evidence of a crime.
Multifaceted pressure has been exerted on workers, students and artists.
Turkey has become a state of repression and profiling, where police and intelligence officers use their powers arbitrarily and excessively.
Mass detentions have become commonplace and unlawful arrests have become a form of punishment.
Excessive use of force, ill-treatment and insults have become commonplace.
CHP will take all necessary legal and administrative measures to ensure that the freedom of assembly and demonstration of our citizens reaches the level of advanced democracies.
FREE AND POLYPHONIC MEDIA
Freedom of expression was most severely curtailed in the media and the Internet.
Contrary to the developments in the civilized world, Turkey has become a country that censors the media and the Internet, arrests journalists and intimidates dissenting views.
Internet bans are an important indication that the government does not believe in freedom of expression and free public space.
CHP will first and foremost protect the right of the press to report freely and the right of citizens to be informed from different sources.
The media and the Internet will be rescued from the massive blackout and all kinds of information will be brought to light.
RTÜK, TRT and the media organizations transferred to the SDIF have become tools of biased propaganda.
Turkey, which should be one of the leading countries of the information society and knowledge economy with its young and educated population, has been transformed into a country of censorship and investigations under the current government.
CHP will take all legal and financial measures to create an independent, free and pluralistic media and protect citizens' right to be informed from different sources.
ORGANIZED SOCIETY
Civil society in our country is under pressure from the political power
. Civil society, which should be a space of organized pluralism, is rapidly being brought under the power of the government and is being tried to be made monophonic.
The principle of democratic pluralism is seen as a threat by the government.
Trade unions, professional chambers and employers' associations are forced to act close to the government.
Academics, writers and artists are scapegoated at every opportunity.
The government monopolistically and nepotistically seeks to create its own civil society, marginalizing organizations that do not act in concert with it and forcing them to become dominant.
However, for democracy to take root in a country, political power must be checked and balanced by a strong civil society.
CHP will make all necessary arrangements to develop organized society and pluralism, which are the foundation and wealth of a democratic society.
INFORMATION SOCIETY AND DEMOCRACY
CHP believes that transformation based on technology and knowledge will strengthen our democracy as much as a strong democracy will contribute to the transition to an information society.
Our citizens will be able to participate more effectively in decision-making processes by utilizing the opportunities provided by the information age at the highest level.
In a CHP government, more investment will be made in education to ensure the transition to an information society, and more opportunities will be provided for our citizens to realize themselves.
With the reorganization of the relationship between the state and citizens within this framework, all our citizens will be able to enjoy their democratic rights to the fullest.
Increased access to information will make it possible for public services to reach a wider audience,
and it will make political processes increasingly transparent.
LIBERTARIAN CONSTITUTION FOR LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRACY
CHP argues that a new constitution that expands and protects the freedoms of all citizens is necessary for the development of liberal democracy and social peace.
The new constitution should be based on democracy, the rule of law, social justice and respect for human rights, and should embrace the whole society.
The CHP's goal is to draft a process-based constitution based on social consensus and broad agreement among political parties.
REPUBLIC OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
We will prioritize securing citizens' right to life.
We will abolish all laws and practices that allow arbitrary violence, persecution, torture and violations of citizens' dignity.
We will provide legal guarantees for the free exercise of the right to peaceful assembly and demonstration.
We will prevent citizens who exercise this right from being seen as "reasonable suspects" by the state.
We will strengthen organized society, which is an indispensable element of libertarian democracy and checks and balances.
We will develop all political, social and cultural rights with a pluralist understanding and together with society.

PRODUCTIVE, JOB PROVIDING, COMPETITIVE
ECONOMY AND ALL-INCLUSIVE GROWTH
The state exists for citizens.
CHP aims for a Turkey where every citizen will live happily, peacefully and comfortably.
Our country is a place where everyone who wants to work can find a job,
that every citizen earns a level of income that matches the living standards in developed countries,
It needs an economic order in which the basic needs of everyone, without exception, are guaranteed by the social state.
CHP, where everyone can invest with confidence,
that he can be paid for his labor,
Turkey is determined to build a Turkey where every citizen can have high skills and access to knowledge and technology.
Under the CHP government, our country will achieve a system in which our citizens will be free not only politically but also economically.
This order is a new development thrust with structural reforms.
and prosperity is shared fairly
will be achieved by implementing a development program.
Our goal is to ensure that our people live longer and healthier lives,
are equipped with the qualifications to compete with the world
, and that the standard of living of our people rises to the level of the most developed countries of the world.
In this context, CHP aims to take our country to the top 20 countries in the UN human development index, where we currently rank 69th, in the next 20 years.
Today, our citizens are unhappy and pessimistic because of the mismanagement of the economy.
Confidence in our economy is gradually disappearing and the investment climate in our country is deteriorating.
In constant prices, private sector investments fell below 2011 levels.
Our economic growth rate is stuck at 2-3%.
Around 6 million citizens are unemployed or have lost hope of finding a job.
Almost one in every five young people is unemployed.
Under AKP rule, our citizens have been rapidly indebted.
Because of the AKP's economic policies, Turkey is facing poverty,
unemployment,
in a spiral of debt and unhappiness.
This is not because of a lack of economic resources, but because of mismanagement of the economy.
The CHP is aware that the economy is not just about managing limited resources.
Rational economic management is based on the effective, efficient and sustainable use of our already enormous economic potential for the benefit of society.
Unfortunately, Turkey is caught in the middle income and middle technology trap.
In 2015, it is understood that our per capita income will fall below 10 thousand dollars and will be back to 2007 levels.
In other words, the income of our citizens has remained stagnant for 8 years.
In the first 7 months of 2015, only 3.3% of manufacturing industry exports were high-tech.
Our citizens certainly do not deserve to waste time and resources due to mismanagement.
On the other hand, the era of cheap and abundant money in the global economy, which is at a new threshold, is coming to an end.
In addition to global risks, regional geopolitical risks in Turkey's geography are becoming increasingly dangerous.
The combination of global and regional risks and Turkey's own economic problems has made the Turkish economy one of the three most fragile in the world since mid-2015.
Unless reforms to eliminate the vulnerabilities in the economy are implemented as soon as possible and confidence is quickly restored, these risks will have an even more negative impact on our economy in the coming days.
CHP eliminates pessimism in our country,
catching up with the information age,
that provides jobs for everyone,
It aspires to power for a Turkey that gives hope to its people by enriching them with an inclusive growth and development strategy.
The CHP's new development drive will take Turkey to its rightful place in the 21st century and ensure a happy and prosperous future for all our citizens.
The CHP's development breakthrough is based on a holistic approach to economic policies.
At the center of our understanding of economic development is investment in people.
This development approach targets knowledge economy, high value-added, innovation-based and competitive production.
This goal includes transforming to a green economy and ensuring sustainability against global warming and environmental pollution.
Unlike neoliberalism, it is the product of an approach in which the market is well and fairly regulated and the public has a strong role to play in ensuring a fair distribution of income and preventing growth from being exclusionary.
The CHP's new development thrust aims for balanced development of agriculture, industry, services and construction sectors through holistic policies.
CHP's economic policies are built on four main axes.
The first axis consists of policies that strengthen democracy, the rule of law, state transparency and accountability, and rule of law.
Open to the world,
Strengthening the EU membership perspective,
A state of law and modern democracy that is accountable to its citizens,
confidence and business climate in the economy will be strengthened.
The second axis consists of policies that increase Turkey's competitiveness in the world.
Policies that will contribute to the productive investments, qualified labor force and productivity growth needed for a competitive economy are the basis of this axis.
The third axis consists of policies to ensure that economic development and growth is spread to all segments of society, that growth embraces everyone and that no one is excluded from the welfare created.
The fourth axis of the CHP's economic strategy includes policies committed to maintaining social and environmental balance along with economic stability.
The first generation reforms, which were realized at great cost to our citizens in the past, have been destroyed in the 13 years of AKP rule.
The CHP's new development drive will re-enforce these reforms to ensure macroeconomic stability.
In addition, the CHP's new development drive will help Turkey overcome the middle-income crisis it has fallen into.
and out of the middle technology trap,
It will also include a second generation of structural reforms that will have an impact in the medium and long term.
In CHP government, effective fiscal and monetary policies that will establish macroeconomic stability will be implemented rapidly.
Fiscal discipline, debt sustainability and balances, within the framework of a prescribed fiscal policy,
Measures will be taken to support growth and ensure the spread of prosperity to the population.
Thus, investor confidence will be rapidly restored and
Turkey will become an investable country.
Increasing physical investment is a priority for solving the problem of jobs and employment.
However, CHP is aware that Turkey's employment problem cannot be solved by investments alone.
CHP believes that an effective education reform is necessary to improve economic competitiveness as well as investments to increase employment.
Both physical and human investments will increase productivity across the economy.
Thus, the Turkish economy will not become an economy that competes with low wages, but an economy that competes and prosper by increasing productivity.
In CHP government, tax, income and labor organization policies will be utilized to ensure that everyone gets the share they deserve from the income created.
With the CHP's new development drive, Turkey will maximize its most important advantage: its demographic window of opportunity.
The window of opportunity offered by our young population is open for the next 20 years.
In order to make use of this limited time, labor force participation will be increased by taking measures to remove the obstacles in front of young people and women in working life.
In addition to its young population, Turkey's geography offers extraordinary opportunities and possibilities.
Turkey is a 3-4 hour flight from the world's most important markets.
With the right policies, Turkey has the opportunity to become an important production, investment and logistics base in the middle of Europe, Asia and Africa.
In order to turn these two important advantages into opportunities, the "Central Turkey" project will be implemented in the second year of the CHP government.
Within the scope of the project, the new logistics and high value-added production-oriented smart city to be established in Anatolia will be connected to important ports in Turkey via rail networks.
This project will boost Turkey's competitiveness and
accelerate its exit from the middle income and middle technology trap.
Thanks to this project, neglected Anatolia will become an important logistics and production base for the whole world.
With this project, Turkey will become a global port that will increase the accessibility and capability of the entire nearby geography, which is not connected to the sea, to world trade.
Central Turkey is a regional enrichment project that will connect economies, markets and cultures, and consolidate peace and tranquility in the geography in which our country is located.
In the 21st century, the main source of production is knowledge.
Technology and information infrastructure are needed for knowledge to be used and transformed into production.
The CHP's economic program prioritizes investing in knowledge, knowledge infrastructure and people.
With investments in these areas and an economic model based on dynamic manpower, Turkey will be at the forefront of the world league.
Turkey has the potential to rapidly transition to a knowledge economy and compete internationally.
The CHP's economic program will realize this potential and provide a better life for everyone by solving the resource problem in the Turkey of the future.

SOLIDARITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
Fighting inequality and poverty is a human responsibility.
Eradicating poverty and ensuring social development is also a fundamental condition for deepening democracy, accelerating economic development and ensuring social cohesion in a country.
The CHP is the political party that has put forward the most ambitious and comprehensive programs to create an egalitarian society and ensure social development.
The basis of democracy is free people.
Guaranteeing political freedoms is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of the individual.
To be free, citizens must be economically independent,
should get their fair share of income,
should not face discrimination in any area of social life.
It is the duty of the social state to ensure the political and economic freedom of citizens.
Rapid and sustainable economic development cannot be realized in a country without adequate social development.
It is the duty of the social state to create the productive and skilled labor force required for the economy by taking the best care of the health, education and security of citizens.
Eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities will strengthen social solidarity and reduce social tensions.
It will bring political stability, peace and tranquility to our country.
AKP'S SOCIAL BENEFITS
The social state in Turkey is weak and inadequate.
In the last thirteen years that AKP has been in power, no significant steps have been taken to strengthen the social state.
The AKP government's budgetary allocation for social assistance is only half of the EU average.
However, the level and rate of poverty in Turkey is incomparably higher than in these countries.
The way in which social assistance is provided is degrading to the dignity of the citizens who receive it.
Social assistance is distributed by a large number of institutions in an unregulated, irregular, almost haphazard manner.
Those who are poor but do not directly apply to the relevant social assistance institutions cannot access assistance.
Citizens live with the suspicion that aid will not last.
Excessive and irregular expenditures and corruption in the procurement and distribution of aid materials are encountered.
Aid does not aim to make those in need self-sufficient.
AKP has condemned Turkey to policies based on a "social aid for votes" approach.
Under AKP rule, no significant progress has been made in strengthening the social state and creating a fairer social order.
CHP aims to achieve social justice by prioritizing the goal of strengthening the social state.
These strategies are "inclusive growth",
"holistic social policy"
and "pre-division."
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
The Human Development Indicator prepared by the United Nations assesses development by taking into account criteria such as the status of women, health, education, poverty, employment and citizen security.
In 2014, Turkey ranked 69th among the world countries in this indicator published by the UN.
Under AKP rule, Turkey has been condemned to remain among the world's socially underdeveloped countries.
The solution is the "inclusive development" strategy proposed by the CHP.
Inclusive development is inclusive, not exclusive.
Because inclusive development is the key to economic growth,
health to improve the quality of life of individuals,
Work,
education,
clean environment
and social support policies.
Economic policies that pursue inclusive development should be prepared and implemented taking into account all disadvantaged groups, including women, youth, persons with disabilities, the elderly and pensioners.
The inclusive development strategy envisages an equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth that will ensure that they reach every part of Turkey and every segment of society.
Through new and increased social investments, it envisages the development of healthy, secure citizens, equipped with the knowledge and skills required by our age, who benefit from lifelong learning opportunities.
Low-skilled labor to skilled labor,
It envisages the transformation of low value-added production into high value-added production.
CHP will be the architect and implementer of "inclusive growth" in Turkey, which is the basis of "Social Europe".
CHP is determined to reflect the economic development of our country to human development and to bring Turkey among the top 20 countries in the UN Human Development Ranking.
HOLISTIC SOCIAL POLICY
The inequalities that exist in our society are multifaceted and multidimensional.
Inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth are the main source of inequality and poverty.
Differences based on gender, place of residence, ethnicity, religion and sect also play an important role in the transmission of inequalities and poverty from generation to generation.
In many cases, these factors coexist and affect the same people and the same segments of society at the same time.
For example, the poor living in a backward region of our country may face all the barriers of rural environment, patriarchal values and exclusion based on ethnicity, in addition to low income.
This is why the fight against inequality and poverty requires a holistic social policy approach.
Social policies should be prepared and implemented taking into account all dimensions of poverty and inequality.
To this end, women must be empowered at home and in society.
Poor children's school fees should be covered by the state, including university preparation and university education.
Social support programs should be developed that take into account the situation of the disabled, the chronically ill and the elderly without income in the same household.
Those living in economically underdeveloped regions of Turkey should be prioritized for social assistance.
The CHP Family Insurance Program is a holistic social policy project that addresses all aspects of poverty and aims to eradicate it.
PRE-DIVISION
Inequalities are rooted in the place of birth of children, their gender and the educational attainment of their parents - conditions that are completely independent of their own choices and efforts.
In Turkey, inequality and poverty are passed down from generation to generation.
Poor children remain in a cycle of poverty because they do not have access to quality health and education services.
An education system that fails to create equal opportunities restricts social mobility and does not provide opportunities for new generations to live in better conditions than the previous generation.
CHP adopts the principle of "pre-distribution" to prevent inequalities at the source in our society, where inequalities are rife.
Pre-distribution is based on the principle that all citizens should have economic, social and cultural opportunities from the beginning of their lives.
CHP is aware that equal opportunities for citizens minimize the impact of conditions such as place of birth and parents' education on life opportunities.
CHP's goal is to ensure that all children have a strong and fair start to life with equal rights and opportunities.
To prevent children from being condemned to inequality due to circumstances beyond their control.
Promote social investments to build a strong pre-distribution system,
health
and quality public services in education need to be improved.
Inequality and social injustices must be tackled starting from before birth.
The fate of a child should no longer be determined by which parents and where in the country a child is born.
CHP FAMILY INSURANCE PROGRAM
At the center of the CHP's strong social state project is "Family Insurance".
The main objective of Family Insurance is to develop a modern social security system and social protection network in Turkey.
To liberate all our citizens from all forms of marginalization, without any discrimination.
With the CHP Family Insurance Program, our citizens will be able to live as independent, free and equal individuals without needing anyone; individuals, families and the position of women within the family will be strengthened.
The CHP Family Insurance Program will form the basis of a strong social state in Turkey.
According to EU norms, those with incomes below 60% of the national median income are considered poor.
In Turkey, there are 3 million 750 thousand poor households and 16 million 700 thousand people living in these households.
The CHP Family Insurance Program will provide regular and adequate monthly financial support to every citizen whose income is below the poverty line and raise their income above this line.
This support would be a "civil right".
With the CHP Family Insurance Program, social assistance will be doubled to the EU average of 2.5% of GDP.
Under the CHP Family Insurance Program, supports such as infant nutrition support, nursery support, general health insurance premium support, disability support, elderly support, military service support, pregnancy support, home care support, etc. will be provided.
Cash payments will be made to the women's bank account.
Family Insurance will support free, quality full-day education for every child, starting with pre-school.
Every child will have access to health, nutrition, social and cultural development opportunities until the age of 18.
In contrast to the AKP government's social assistance policies, the CHP Family Insurance Program will encourage employment and women's work.
Family Insurance will be conditional on the unemployed members of the household looking for a job through İŞKUR and attending vocational courses.
CHP Family Insurance aims to strengthen individual autonomy, family and social solidarity, which have been weakened under AKP rule.
It aims to enable families and individuals to stand on their own feet and look to the future with confidence.
With the CHP Family Insurance Program, all our citizens will become the cornerstones of a happy and democratic society.
CONCLUSION
A humane life can only be possible in an order where social welfare, happiness and income are equitably distributed and all citizens have equal access to education and health services.
The CHP's goal is to establish an order in which our citizens can live justly, honorably and humanely without worrying about the future.
Under CHP rule, no citizen will be homeless,
will not go to bed hungry
and children will not have to work.
Under CHP rule, no citizen will have to accept dangerous working conditions and wages below the minimum wage because they are poor.
Under CHP rule, women will be empowered in society and participate more in the labor force.
Young people will be helped to find jobs and start their own lives.
The social state that the CHP will strengthen will ensure equity, development and prosperity in our country.
CHP will put an end to this system that makes our citizens dependent on individuals and politics.
An order in which our citizens can live in security and look to the future with confidence will be established.

QUALIFIED PUBLIC SERVICE FOR THE DOMESTIC
It has become a great necessity to adopt universal service principles free from favoritism in the public administration of our country.
The CHP has carefully and thoroughly prepared a radical public administration reform program that prioritizes the needs of society and is based on the common good.
The AKP government has plunged the institutional organization of the state and the public administration into an environment of arbitrariness, unprincipledness and favoritism.
Due to shortsighted, partisan and personalized interventions, public administration has been transformed into an inequitable and inefficient wheel of interest.
The principles of merit, efficiency and non-discrimination in public services have been trampled on.
As a political party, the AKP was not content with being the government and running the government, it politicized public institutions from top to bottom and attempted to impose its "party-state management" approach on society.
Dysfunctionalization of institutions and ineffective staff due to political or personal attitudes is not acceptable in terms of objective public administration.
As wrong as it is for institutions to operate without accountability, it is equally wrong for them to be rendered inoperable by political interference.
Public institutions, whose raison d'être is to provide services to society, should be prevented from acting arbitrarily or with a partisan purge approach.
Institutions should operate in accordance with their job descriptions, respect legal limits and act with a personnel regime based on merit criteria.
Merit criteria must be redefined for all public positions and examination systems must be reformed in an equitable manner and open to the information of citizens.
Under a CHP government, hiring without exams will be ended and completely politicized preferences in transfers and promotions will be prevented.
CHP will help citizens to see themselves again as a functioning part of the public system, both in terms of examination systems, working conditions and appointments.
CHP will establish a modern infrastructure where citizens can easily use e-government facilities.
The habit of stereotypically responding to citizens' problems and expectations through technological means will not suffice.
Support opportunities will be offered to elderly and electronically illiterate citizens.
Based on its understanding of universal and effective public service, the CHP will not allow citizens to bear the costs of profit-oriented co-payments, fees, etc.
Under CHP rule, the "citizen" dimension will be added to the principles of effectiveness and efficiency in public services.
The understanding that public services should be provided by the state as a right of citizenship, not as a favor, will be undermined.
Citizen-public administration relations will be free from political influence and vested interests.
In all transactions carried out by central or local governments, the expectations and demands of citizens will be taken as a basis, and no one will be allowed to benefit personally.
The state and public officials will not be implicated in massive corruption, which is unprecedented in the history of the world, and public administration will be brought to light.
AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT WILL CARRY OUR COUNTRY INTO THE FUTURE
Education is an indispensable need and a fundamental human right for all people.
It is only through quality education that individuals can reveal all their talents, and only through a good education can they fully realize themselves.
Education is a key element in raising virtuous citizens.
Education is the most fundamental tool that not only ensures individual development but also the elimination of social inequalities.
Education makes the poor wealthy and the weak strong.
It allows understanding, sharing and contributing to the development of the common values of humanity.
It makes societies more civilized, more democratic and more prosperous.
CHP's primary political goal is to ensure quality education as a universal right for every citizen.
CHP believes that education is indispensable for our citizens to have a say in their future and to live as independent individuals.
Education, especially equality between men and women,
fight against poverty
and will be the most important tool for development.
CHP believes that all investments in education are in fact investments in freedom, peaceful coexistence and social development.
Education provided in accordance with democratic and contemporary values is the greatest means of combating cultural prejudices and inequalities in income, ethnic groups and sects.
Today, education is the primary source of human development and social justice as well as economic development.
Skilled labor force and rich human resources, which are the essential elements of the knowledge economy, can only be created through an education system that meets the requirements of our age.
The prerequisite for an economy that is innovative, uses advanced technology and produces high added value is a qualified
and an egalitarian education system.
The CHP's main tool for achieving this goal is compulsory pre-school education,
at least eight years of uninterrupted basic education,
a vocational education system that fully meets the demands of the economic world
and is determined to bring the free university system, which is the source of learning, research and creativity, to our country as soon as possible.
HEALTH AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING
Our basic principle will be that citizens will be able to benefit from health services to the extent of their needs, when and where they need them.
CHP will increase the budgetary allocation for health services.
Under CHP rule, more well-trained doctors, nurses and technicians will be trained.
Emphasis will be placed on preventive health services aimed at protecting citizens before they become ill.
In a CHP government, the prerequisite for benefiting from health services will not be the amount of premiums paid or the money in one's pocket.
CHP will ensure that quality health services are provided to all segments of society without discrimination.
While increasing the quality of health services, all measures will be taken to ensure that health workers can work in a secure manner, and the personal rights and working conditions of all personnel will be improved.
CHP will take bold steps to develop the domestic health industry in the areas of pharmaceuticals and consumables, equipment and software.
National health technologies will be developed in cooperation with TÜBİTAK, techno-cities and medical faculties.
CULTURE AND ART
Creating a reconciliatory political environment that will eliminate polarization and conflicts arising from prejudice, marginalization and discrimination is at the top of CHP's political priorities.
In CHP government, a new approach to be developed in line with the principles of equality, freedom and solidarity will protect our cultural diversity while preventing cultural differences from causing divisions and conflicts.
Ending political and arbitrary bans and censorship stemming from cultural marginalization is at the heart of CHP's cultural policies.
All culture and arts activities, including cultural industries, fine arts, performing arts, cultural heritage, publishing, cinema, music, photography and cultural tourism, are the greatest creative potential of our country.
The CHP opposes commercialization in the fields of culture and arts over human creativity and innovation.
Cultural policies will be developed within the framework of an understanding that will ensure the development of the economy, the increase of national welfare and the emotional and spiritual enrichment of our citizens.
SPORTS
The primary goal in sports is to create opportunities that will strengthen the human and social development of our country's young population.
The AKP government has adopted an approach that defines quantitative results in sports as success.
Sport has been seen as a tool for propaganda and speculative construction investments.
Mass sports have been relegated to the background.
In professional sports, one big failure followed another.
Resources have been wasted.
Attempts to organize important sports organizations in Turkey have failed.
The AKP government has divided federations, sports clubs and even athletes into supporters and opponents.
Unrelenting political interventions have turned sports into a focus of partisanship, intrigue and suspicion.
Under CHP rule, politics will take its hands off sports completely.
Youth will be emphasized in the management of the Ministry of Youth and Sports.
Under CHP rule, sports will once again be transformed into an area of social dialog and interaction.
Surveillance, profiling and intimidation of fan groups through lawsuits will end.
Disproportionate police violence, detentions and the use of pepper spray in stadiums will not be allowed.
In CHP government, athlete training and development of sports facility infrastructure will be prioritized.
CHP will work to create environments where all citizens, children and elderly, can regularly engage in sports.
Sports fields, green areas and amateur clubs will be established in every neighborhood to meet the needs of all citizens.
CHP's goal is to make young people love sports and raise athletes who will be successful in every field.
CHP will shape its sports policies on the basis of equality and solidarity.
TRANSPORT: INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTEGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Public interest in the planning and implementation of CHP's transportation projects,
public participation,
national resources
and prioritizing the utilization of technologies,
environmental protection,
accountability and transparency principles will be taken as basis.
The goal is to create a qualified and sustainable transportation infrastructure for Turkey as soon as possible.
CHP will prepare a short and long term Transportation Master Plan with the participation of all relevant parties and ensure that the priorities of this plan are followed.
One of the main objectives of the Plan will be to strengthen the transportation links between the east and west, north and south of the country.
A strategic transportation corridor will be created to connect different regions for passenger and freight transportation and the transfer of energy resources.
Land, rail, air and maritime transportation will be integrated, national strategic plans will be developed and investments will not be made based on short-term calculations.
Urban transportation and regional development objectives will be aligned with each other.
SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS AND COUNTRY FIRST
CHP believes that in order to ensure the security of our citizens, it is necessary to carefully protect their constitutional rights and gains arising from international conventions.
In a CHP government, no arbitrary practice or action that will overshadow the freedoms of our citizens will go un sanctioned.
On the other hand, security units will not be allowed to be weakened in their fight against any threat to the security of citizens.
Cooperation with international institutions and organizations against all kinds of terrorist acts at national and regional level will be emphasized.
Support the efforts of the EU and other multilateral organizations to which Turkey belongs to dry up the internal and external financial sources of terrorism.
The neglected security of our borders will be restored and no armed group will be allowed to engage in terrorist activities within the borders of the Republic of Turkey.
The CHP's main goal will be to make Turkey a country where citizens, and especially women, will feel safe in every corner of the country, especially in their homes, villages and neighborhoods.
CONCLUSION

RIGHT TO NATURE AND THE CITY
In order to protect the environment we live in and improve our quality of life, the principles of the "right to nature" and the "right to the city" must be resolutely upheld.
CHP places the "right to nature" and the "right to the city" at the center of all its policies.
Today, problems such as climate change, deterioration in the ecological system, population growth and overexploitation of natural resources affect the whole world.
Global average temperatures are rising and sea levels are rising due to widespread snow and ice melting.
The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events such as droughts and floods are increasing worldwide.
Turkey is located in one of the regions of the world that will be most affected by climate change.
As a result of climate change, a temperature increase of 5-7 degrees Celsius and a decrease of up to 20% in average precipitation are predicted for Turkey in the 21st century
. Those who will be most affected by climate change are the segments of society least responsible for these changes.
These include farmers, agricultural workers, fishermen and poor households facing food insecurity as they struggle to produce in an increasingly difficult climate.
In order to solve these problems that threaten the world and its living beings, it is necessary to put an end to the economic approach that only considers quantitative growth.
CHP is based on the principle of the "right to nature", which gives equal importance to all the world's assets, and on the understanding of quality, sustainable growth.
In line with this principle, it is determined to move our country step by step towards a "green economy" as in developed countries.
CHP prioritizes agricultural and industrial policies that ensure the efficient use and fair distribution of sustainable resources.
It advocates supporting these policies with quality public services and innovative local government projects.
These measures will protect and strengthen highly vulnerable layers of society.
Under the CHP government, structural changes will be implemented to produce eco-friendly technology, goods and services and create employment opportunities in these sectors.
Realistic targets will be set for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.
CHP considers the individual as a whole with the nature in which he/she lives.
The CHP's understanding of the economy is based on the principle of development of society in harmony with the environment.
In order to ensure humane and healthy living conditions for future generations, it is essential that all resources are used equitably and fairly.
Acting with this understanding, CHP shapes its nature, environment and urban policies within the framework of nature-friendly growth.
CHP aims to carry out its environmental rights and national environmental security work in partnership and in harmony with the policies of the international community.
CHP will work for our country to be among the model countries of the UN's green policies.
The CHP's development model, which is based on the fulfillment of responsibilities towards nature and future generations, will ensure that our country gains a respected place in the international community.
The CHP believes that protecting nature is a fundamental moral responsibility and works to raise awareness about the "right to nature" and fights for the protection of this right.
In a CHP government, the right of every human being and living creature to live together in a clean and protected nature will be guaranteed as a constitutional right.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SUSTAINABLE URBANIZATION
In our country, the vast majority of the population now lives in cities.
The protection and cleanliness of the environment is as essential for the city as it is for the countryside.
For this reason, the CHP's understanding of urbanization is not only socially just and developmentalist, but also nature-friendly.
Urban policies should be based on an approach that is environmentally and socio-economically sustainable.
The cleanliness and safety of cities must be taken into account and sustainable resources must be used efficiently.
CHP attaches importance to the creation of "smart cities" in our country.
Smart cities aim to make widespread use of new technologies, protect ecological balance and increase energy savings.
The aim is to preserve natural resources for future generations, to protect the quality of life and natural balance, and to develop green building and green relationship networks.
In order to realize these goals, new and smart housing types that can create alternatives to existing housing types, primarily increasing energy savings, should be designed.
A CHP government will take the city from gray to green, both materially and spiritually.
It will implement policies to sustain the vitality of people and the ecosystem and design the cities of the future with this understanding.
CHP will increase citizens' access to green spaces and clean air, and ensure that they live healthy lives in healthy cities.
With the CHP's "bio-region" approach, water basins, soil, climate, flora and fauna relations will be taken into consideration, and strategies will be developed for the balanced use of existing resources in the regions.
Ensuring that city dwellers benefit from all kinds of infrastructure, housing facilities and cultural activities is among the priorities of the CHP government.
CHP's urban policies will ensure that our cities have easy access to all infrastructure services, especially healthy drinking water and sewage.
Under CHP rule, safe and easy transportation facilities will be improved in cities.
The budget allocated to urban and intercity transportation will be increased,
urban transportation will be planned based on new techniques and expertise.
In order to prevent traffic congestion, all transportation facilities, especially rail systems, will be rapidly developed.
Innovative spatial arrangements such as quiet streets, play streets, walking streets will be part of the urban design.
Pedestrian and bicycle priority arrangements will be made in urban traffic.
Parking areas will be organized in a way to reduce traffic density and the long-term transfer of these areas to the private sector for rent generation will be prevented.
INCLUSIVE URBANIZATION
One of the most important problems Turkey faces is marginalization, segregation and exclusion.
Inequality is at the root of these problems.
Class, ethnic and sectarian divisions disrupt the social fabric and weaken trust and solidarity in social life.
CHP will solve these problems, which stem from inequality and destabilize cities, with the principle of "inclusive urbanization".
CHP government will integrate segregated cities and strengthen social solidarity with its "inclusive urbanization" approach.
All city dwellers should be able to benefit from urban services at the highest level and have easy access to all kinds of common and public spaces.
The division of cities between protected villas, slums, slums, slums, concrete towers and business centers must end.
With the support of architects, designers and planners, urban policies should be developed to bring together people from different backgrounds living in different places.
CHP argues that the problems of segregation and exclusion can be solved starting from the streets.
Streets, districts, neighborhoods and cities must be made safe for all residents.
Streets and squares should be full of people and pedestrian-friendly.
Neighbors should get to know each other, neighborhood ties should be strengthened and solidarity between neighbors should be increased.
People living in the same place should feel that they belong.
Citizens from different backgrounds and all segments of society should be able to build reconciliatory relations with each other.
Streets must become places of justice and tolerance.
CHP advocates that all citizens should be supported to live together and relate to each other without giving in to the fragile trend of multiculturalism and the pressure for assimilation in our cities.
CHP municipalities are pioneers in developing sports facilities and playgrounds, parks and gardens, fairs and festivals for citizens to spend quality time together.
The AKP's construction and rent-oriented urbanization approach leads to a decrease in the quality of life in the city and increases social exclusion.
However, urban and housing policies should not aim at rent and speculation, but at uniting citizens from different origins.
CHP opposes the commodification of public assets and their transformation into exclusionary private property.
Revenues from urban rents should be used for the benefit of society.
The public must be given a say in the use of financial resources.
URBANIZATION BASED ON INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY
Today, cities are the locomotive of economic development.
This is because new knowledge, technologies and products created by the knowledge economy are developed in cities.
That is why CHP attaches great importance to revitalizing our cities and developing their innovative capacities.
The vitality of cities depends on meeting their housing, workplace and transportation needs, especially physical infrastructure.
Cities should have a rich and diversified consumption infrastructure.
CHP argues that every component of the trade and retail sector, from bazaar shopkeepers to online shopping, from boutique stores to department stores, from weekly markets to shopping malls, should be supported separately and together.
The main element of mobilizing the creative and innovative potential of cities and revitalizing them is the breakthroughs in education, science and technology.
However, the AKP government has blocked the way to science, innovation and technological development by turning the education system into a jigsaw puzzle, restricting freedom of thought and putting universities under pressure.
CHP prioritizes the development of R&D, creative design and innovation activities in universities, research institutions and high-tech sectors within the framework of "innovation-based urbanization".
As important as new investments are for the development of cities, the training of a skilled workforce is equally important.
Because creative work today has become the work of a skilled and specialized group.
The economic base of the city should be broadened and economic activities in cities should be diversified in order to attract highly skilled specialists and creatives.
Cooperation between firms and regional clusters is made possible by the flow of information and inter-institutional linkages that can be established through geographical proximity.
What makes a city attractive is culture and arts, which are important sources of creativity and innovation.
The coexistence of working life, living spaces and leisure activities creates an important attraction for both new investments and skilled labor.
Creative people such as scientists, engineers, architects, writers, artists, advertisers and designers prefer to live in vibrant cities.
CHP attaches great importance to the development of cultural activities and cultural industry in our cities.
The CHP considers arts and culture as one of the main elements of open-mindedness, tolerance, raising civilized and virtuous citizens as well as economic development.
Theaters, orchestra halls, art galleries, libraries; music, film and television studios; media organizations and advertising companies bring revitalization to the city.
The cultural economy makes the city attractive, exciting and creative.
Work in the field of culture and arts enables creativity to flourish and flourish.
Aware of this, the CHP is determined to make a breakthrough in all these areas.
Under AKP rule, art and artists are not given the importance they need.
Moreover, all kinds of creative activities are suppressed and urban life is dampened.
CHP's understanding of culture and art is based on freedom, pluralism and creativity.
CHP believes that all obstacles to the arts must be removed.
Against AKP's conservative, oppressive and rent-based urbanization approach, CHP advocates innovation, creativity and culture-based urbanization.
CHP promises to create vibrant and bright cities for our citizens.
URBANIZATION POLICIES
The principles of the "right to nature" and the "right to the city" require supporting the struggle of urban dwellers for their needs.
For this reason, CHP is based on participation and equality in urban planning.
In CHP government, city residents, NGOs, universities and other stakeholders will be included in decision-making processes.
The appropriateness and validity of the projects will be handled within the framework of objective criteria and with a solidarity approach.
Innovative urban policies will be designed within the framework of "slow planning" and "slow city" approach.
Instead of demolition, the principles of in-situ transformation, preservation and development, and elimination of existing physical and social barriers will be taken as basis.
In urban regeneration policies, instead of imposing and hasty approaches, a "process management" approach that takes into account economic and social dimensions will be adopted.
CHP government will act with the understanding of "sharing cities" and instead of competition between cities, cooperation and experience sharing will be the basis.
Urbanism that unites in terms of resources, technology and knowledge, not separates, will be the fundamental principle.
At the same time, our cities will have a presence on global platforms and will be able to cooperate with local governments of other states.
Under the CHP government, the confusion of plans and authorities between the central administration and local governments will be eliminated.
In project development and implementation, the imposing and top-down attitude of the central administration will be put an end to, and the principle of pluralism will be adopted in local governments.
The resources provided by the central administration will be distributed according to needs and local governments will be able to decide how to use them.
Local governments will be treated fairly in service delivery and party discrimination will be ended.
In order to ensure the principle of transparency, revenues and expenditures of local governments will be made open to public scrutiny.

PATRIOT AND VALUE-BASED FOREIGN POLICY
The AKP's foreign policy has ensured "peace neither at home nor in the world".
Our citizens are paying the price of AKP's adventurous foreign policy with their lives and property.
It has become imperative that our foreign relations be restructured and harmonized with the requirements of the modern world.
CITIZEN-CENTERED FOREIGN POLICY
The priority in foreign policy is the security, peace and prosperity of our citizens.
Under CHP rule, the state will not jeopardize the lives of its citizens and will reassure its citizens wherever they are in the world.
Under the CHP government, we will act with international cooperation against terrorist organizations, especially ISIS, especially in our border regions.
Our goal is to prevent terrorist organizations and sectarian wars from harming our citizens and the people of the region.
Strong regional cooperation is essential to ensure security in the region.
Protecting the legitimate rights of our entrepreneurs and increasing investment opportunities will be among our prioritized foreign policy objectives.
VALUES-BASED FOREIGN POLICY
The sources of our values are to be found in the history of our Republic and in social democracy.
The CHP will work for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to all foreign policy problems.
Pacifism is the most important goal that our founding leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk set for us with his words "peace at home, peace in the world".
Pacifism is the guarantee of stability, peace and prosperity in the region and the world.
The foreign policy of the CHP government will be based on human rights and freedoms.
The CHP government will work in cooperation with international organizations and non-governmental organizations to strengthen human rights.
Turkey will become an exemplary country that respects human rights; it will become a leading country and a staunch supporter of human rights organizations.
The basis of legitimacy in foreign policy is international law.
CHP's foreign policy will be based on respect for international law.
CHP will conduct its foreign policy in harmony with the international community.
Turkey will make all kinds of contributions to all international organizations, especially the UN, of which we are a member, to ensure peace, stability and development.

The goal is to eradicate poverty and conditions that undermine human dignity.
Turkey's diversity and multiculturalism is its most important foreign policy strength.
Pre-AKP governments tried to emphasize Turkey's multidimensional identity in foreign policy.
Turkey is a unique country with its experience of democracy, its relations with the West, its beliefs and values, and its secularism.
Turkey bears the cultural characteristics of different regions.
For this reason, countries around us with different cultures feel close to Turkey.
As long as it maintains its multicolor and polyphony, it will be the most important center of attraction in its region.
Turkey, with its secular structure respectful of all religious and sectarian identities, will become a center of stability where the culture and religious traditions of Anatolia will shed light on all countries in the region.
Our foreign policy should be at an equal distance to all cultures, religions and sects, and should aim for them to live in peace and tranquility.
This is why the CHP defends the principle of secularism, which ensures equality among all beliefs in foreign policy.
In its foreign policy, the CHP will firmly adhere to all the achievements of our Republic, especially secularism, which is the guarantee of freedom, equality and democratic ways of life and the basis of social harmony.
DANGEROUS LONELINESS: NEITHER PEACE AT HOME NOR IN THE WORLD
The AKP is committed to improving our relations with our neighbors, especially with the EU.
He came to power in a favorable foreign policy environment where powerful actors, including Turkey and the US, supported Turkey.
When AKP came to power, rapprochement diplomacy was established with Greece and Adana with Syria,
Eurasian Protocols were signed with Russia.
Leading EU members and the US were working hard to remove obstacles to Turkey's EU accession process.
Despite this favorable climate, the AKP has plunged Turkey into dangerous isolation in its region and the world.
The AKP's adventurous, imperious and authoritarian foreign policy has undermined Turkey's weight, reputation and positive image in the world.
The AKP's efforts to become a regional power by turning its back on the EU, the US, the Caucasus and Central Asia have been a complete failure.
Unfortunately, Turkey has become a country that is not taken seriously in its region and the world, excluded from international processes, even perceived as an open enemy by some of its neighbors, and on the brink of war.
Our country is becoming isolated, losing its communication channels and losing its prestige.
The AKP can democratize, the rule of law,
Expectations that it can uphold human rights and freedoms have collapsed all over the world.
The AKP's power and capacity to solve the problems in foreign policy is completely exhausted.
Taking into account the changing global conditions and the new balances emerging in our region, peace
and establishing a foreign relations order that favors prosperity should be Turkey's primary goal.
In this framework, the CHP will implement a citizen-centered, values-based, pluralist foreign policy that is at peace with the world.
MIDDLE EAST
In the Middle East, some states are weakening, borders are being eroded and the process of lawlessness is spreading.
Ethnic, religious and sectarian conflicts are escalating and identity politics is taking precedence over civic politics.
Criminal and terrorist organizations turn countries into bloodbaths.
The AKP government's "strategic depth" policy, which envisions Turkey's domination of the Ottoman geography, has plunged Turkey into chaos in the Middle East and at home.
By emphasizing unrealistic historical fictions, the AKP has brought sectarian identity to Turkey's foreign policy.
As a result of alliances with the wrong actors in the Middle East, our country has been made a part of the divisions and conflicts in neighboring countries.
Turkey has been reduced to a country that covets the territorial integrity of its neighbors.
We have no border security.
Our citizens are worried that Turkey is being dragged into an adventure and plunged into a war.
The refugee problem,
foreign trade and
stagnation of investments
and threats to life safety continue to harm our citizens.
Our citizens cannot trade with many countries and are excluded from important trade routes.
It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to travel in neighboring countries.
AKP's peace in the region
and cannot develop partnerships that produce cooperation
and clearly does not have the capacity to lead.
The AKP, which tried to play the role of a playmaker in the Middle East, has become an actor producing regional instability.
The CHP will be a problem-solving party in Middle East politics and foreign policy, not a problem-maker.
The CHP will restore our country's role as a mediator for peace in the Middle East, a role lost by the AKP.
A negotiation process will be initiated with Syria that can prevent a conflict,
relations with Egypt and Israel will be established within the framework of inter-state relations,
We will improve relations with Libya and Yemen,
Russia
and our relations with Iran will be strengthened.
The imperious tone, aggressive attitude and sectarian policies towards our neighbors in the Middle East will be abandoned and replaced by constructive dialogue and good, lasting and sustainable relations.
CHP is determined to restore Turkey's position as a credible and reliable country in the Middle East.
EUROPEAN UNION
Turkey's isolation is the result of AKP's Middle East policies as well as its EU policies.
Under AKP rule, priority has been given to the Middle East in a unidirectional way, and the balance in our foreign policy between Europe and the Middle East has been disrupted.
AKP governments are moving away from the core values of the EU and failing to implement the regulatory reforms envisaged by the EU.
The European orientation, which is deeply rooted in the history of our foreign policy, will be maintained under the CHP government.
CHP defines Europe as a set of values based on democracy, human rights and the social state.
Being part of a Europe defined in this way will strengthen Turkey.
Turkey should be part of this family that values human rights, democracy, education, technology, women and the arts.
In order to take part in a new enlargement process, Turkey should be part of the development of the EU's new neighborhood, energy and migration policies.
CHP argues that Turkey should turn its attention back to the EU in order to restore peace and security in our region and to become a model country again.
Turkey should be the country that represents EU values in its neighborhood.
Under CHP rule, Turkey will use the prestigious position and soft power it will gain through EU relations to restore stability in our region within the framework of democratic principles.
Turkey's progress in the EU accession process will contribute to our country taking its rightful place in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations.
Together with its leftist, social democratic allies, the CHP will both contribute to the reform of Europe and open the doors closed to Turkey.
CHP is the only political party with the vision to revive Turkey's stalled EU process.
The CHP initiated Turkey's EU candidacy, and it is the CHP that will successfully complete this process.
A FOREIGN POLICY OPEN TO THE WORLD
The world is becoming increasingly multipolar and polycentric.
This is why our foreign policy must be multilateral, not unilateral.
Turkey can strengthen its international position not by isolation but by building partnerships with other countries.
This requires abandoning the "strategic depth" approach, which is an extension of the Cold War logic, and replacing it with democratic depth,
multilateral policies and new international partnerships.
CHP will accelerate its efforts for regional integration.
In this context, the conclusion of free trade agreements; agreements on mutual encouragement and protection of investments; free movement arrangements; and cooperation agreements in the fields of science, culture and education will be accelerated.
Effective implementation of these agreements will be ensured.
Under CHP leadership, Turkey will become a country open to its region and the world.
Turkey with a revitalized European orientation will be more active in the Balkans.
A Turkey that begins to pursue a policy free of ideological obsessions and sectarianism will revitalize its relations in North Africa.
A Turkey that accepts its friends as equals and becomes a center of attraction again with its good relations with the Western world will be able to strengthen its relations with the Central Asian Turkic Republics, increase economic integration and serve as a bridge between these countries and the Western world.
CHP will open our foreign policy to the rising geographies of the world.
Turkey's presence in these geographies will be consolidated through multilateral policies that go beyond showy visits.
In addition to the formation of continent-based regional associations in Europe, Asia, North and South America, partnerships between countries that cross continental borders are being established.
Our country has important advantages of being located in a geography with multiple regions and many new power centers.
Ensuring the highest level of peace, security and prosperity for our citizens depends on seizing opportunities for cooperation with all nearby regions and partnerships.
CHP is determined to strengthen Turkey's regional cooperation areas.
Asia is experiencing rapid economic growth.
CHP will maximize our economic and cultural relations by finding common ground with these countries, whose weight is increasing in the world economy.
With its strong Socialist International ties, the CHP will make Turkey a respected and popular actor in Latin America.
It will develop lasting relations with all African countries on the basis of solidarity and development partnership.
With the CHP's multilateral policies, Turkey will become a center of international mobility on the North-South and East-West axes.
CHP'S GOAL: PEACE, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT
The CHP's goal is to heal the wounds inflicted by the AKP in our foreign policy and in our region.
The three pillars of the Turkish model are peace, stability
and development.
CHP will ensure that Turkey achieves these goals.
CHP is an alternative to our neighbors and the world, an alternative to AKP,
citizenship at its center,
democracy,
It offers a project of modernity that embraces secularism.
In the CHP government, we will not allow adventurism, hamas, irresponsible behavior with domestic political concerns in our foreign policy.
We will take legitimate actions in line with international law and practice.
He won't touch anyone's honor,
we will not let anyone touch our honor.
In foreign policy, we will always consider our national interests
and make our choices in favor of peace and stability.
We will put diplomacy above any military option and we will not deviate from the path of "peace at home and peace in the world".
Foreign policy will no longer be a domestic political issue.
We will give our foreign policy an entrepreneurial, respectable and understandable content.

TOWARDS AN INFORMATION SOCIETY
Today, industrial societies are rapidly developing and becoming information societies.
We live in an era in which information technologies are used intensively in almost every aspect of our public and private lives, especially in economic activities.
While this great transformation offers great opportunities to all societies, great dangers await those who lag behind.
CHP is the party that understands this change in Turkey and has the vision and projects that will not only keep pace with it, but also make Turkey one of the key actors of this change.
ECONOMY AND INFORMATION SOCIETY
The infrastructure of the information society is an economic order based on high value-added, innovation and competitive production.
The main driving force of the knowledge economy is innovation.
Innovation has become the primary source of production, growth and wealth creation.
Developing technology, increasing value added and raising international competitiveness depend first and foremost on improving a country's capacity to create innovation.
Turkey has failed to make tangible progress in this area.
The concentration in the production of low value-added products in Turkey continues to consolidate.
We remain net importers in technology-intensive areas.
Underlying the chronic current account deficits is the reality of low value added.
Realizing a fundamental structural transformation in Turkey's production pattern will only be possible by creating an innovative knowledge-based economy.
CHP's economic program prioritizes investing in knowledge, knowledge infrastructure and people.
Innovation policies should target both new and traditional sectors.
In traditional industrial branches, qualified design should be emphasized and high value-added production should be ensured.
If the necessary scientific investments are made in Turkey, it is possible to transform low value-added production sectors into high value-added sectors.
This is the only way out of the "middle income trap" that economists constantly draw attention to.
EDUCATION
Transition to an information society requires an effective and radical educational reform.
Education reform will increase labor productivity, wages and the quality of growth.
Education reform will make it possible to maximize the use of existing technologies on the one hand and to create new ones on the other.
This will increase high value-added production in agriculture, industry and services sectors.
Our global competitiveness will increase and the welfare level of our citizens will rise.
The CHP's education reform will center on lifelong learning.
Pre-school education will be free and compulsory for all.
The CHP's education reform will be based on at least eight years of uninterrupted and formal basic education and a total of thirteen years of compulsory education.
During this period, all our children will acquire all the competencies required by the information society, including communication, foreign languages, mathematics, science and technology, digital skills, learning to learn, social and civic skills, entrepreneurial skills and cultural awareness.
The CHP believes that a high quality vocational and academic education following basic education will ensure a skilled workforce with the qualifications required by the age.
For the knowledge society, it is essential to train the workforce to be able to adapt to new conditions.
In the knowledge society, the nature of labor demand and the qualifications required of the workforce are changing rapidly.
Today, young people in education are expected to change their occupation on average seven to eight times during their adult lives.
New industries and emerging sectors do not need workers specialized in a narrow field.
In these sectors, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, communication skills and especially effective digital workers are demanded.
The main characteristic sought in the workforce is transformable skills that can be spread over a wide area.
Even at an advanced age, there is a need for people who can fulfill the requirements of a new profession after a short period of training.
Universities are at the forefront of leading institutions in conducting research, generating new knowledge and developing new technologies.
Particularly creative individuals, such as gifted artists and scientists, prefer to live in spaces and environments where they can exist with their own views and identities and where they are welcomed with tolerance.
This kind of environment increases their creative motivation, energy and productivity.
In short, art today has become the primary driver of scientific creativity and technological development.
The better we understand the importance of freedom, culture and the arts, the more we will be able to accelerate innovation, creativity and growth in our country.
The shortest path to an information society is through the support of culture and arts.
SOCIAL JUSTICE
The transition to an information society requires increasing human development and the social welfare of all citizens, while increasing economic wealth.
Societies with high levels of inequality are not successful in developing the infrastructure of the knowledge economy.
Turkey must stop being a society perpetually plagued by poverty, conflict and social disintegration.
The way to do this is to address all the economic, human and cultural dimensions of change together and to show determination to overcome these problems.
The information society means equality and social justice.
In the information society, more investment is made in human beings and labor is valued more.
Increased access to information facilitates and accelerates access to public services such as education and health, culture and arts, and financial services.
Individuals have a higher quality of life.
CHP will ensure equality of opportunity in access to the means of transition to an information society, especially education, as soon as possible.
GREEN ECONOMY
The new understanding of economic development recognizes that growth must be achieved in a way that takes into account our responsibilities towards the environment.
Growing up by protecting the environment we live in means that we fulfill our responsibility towards future generations.
A perspective that considers human beings together with the nature and environment in which they live should be adopted especially by the younger generations.
Accelerating the transition to the information society is closely related to the development and use of green technologies.
Climate change and environmental issues have gained a serious economic context.
In order to cope with climate change, it is inevitable to favor green technologies and green economy.
The green economy is becoming the investment area that maximizes efficiency and long-term profitability.
Turkey must use green technologies more widely to catch up with the times, achieve sustainable growth and demonstrate that it is taking responsibility for solving this global challenge.
Beyond this, our country should develop its own green economy model and invest heavily in this field to produce green technologies.
In the CHP government, the necessary investments in sustainable energy will be realized rapidly.
CHP will make Turkey one of the leading countries in the world, especially in solar energy research.
Today, the green economy is one of the most important drivers of innovation, high added value and economic growth.
The development of green technologies will give a new impetus to the process of transition to an information society.
In CHP government, all necessary steps will be taken to adopt, develop and use green technologies more widely in our country.
WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN WORKING LIFE AND THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
For a country to have a respected place in the world, equality between women and men must become a fundamental value of society.
A country's ability to achieve a developed economy depends on the widespread participation of women in the labor market.
However, one of the most prominent features of the labor market in Turkey is the very low labor force participation rate of women.
Legal arrangements should be made to increase women's participation in the labor force and improve the welfare of working women in our country,
unregistered work must be prevented
and social policies should be harmonized with EU benchmarks.
As women's level of education increases, their participation in business and working life also increases.
Women with higher levels of education are able to move up the career ladder more quickly and empower themselves in economic and social life.
It is among the primary responsibilities of the CHP to make efforts to protect these gains of women based on the reforms of the Republic.
Women are much more successful in the information society and economy and can reach very high positions.
In the knowledge society, women are at the center of innovation processes.
Countries leading in innovation development are those where the proportion of women working in science and research has reached the level of men.
CHP will work to ensure that women participate in the labor force at much higher rates and participate more effectively in the rising knowledge economy.
CHP will work for women to have the same rights and position as men in all areas of life in order to achieve the goal of a knowledge economy that produces and uses advanced technology.
CONSENSUS AND RECONCILIATION FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
To achieve the information society, the state needs to play a regulatory and conciliatory role.
Businesses should be conscious and sensitive about their social responsibilities.
The world of labour and workers' organizations must always keep the pathways of dialogue and negotiation open.
The state, labor and business should come together regularly on all important issues, not just those concerning labor, to try to reach a social consensus.
Such a search for consensus will create a strong problem-solving culture and lay the foundation for the transition to an information society within a democratic climate.
Such an environment of political stability and consensus needs to be created for long-term investments to take place.
As a social democratic party, the CHP will bring about the great reconciliation needed in our country.
CONCLUSION
Countries that fail to maximize freedoms and democracy are unable to develop the dynamic sectors of the knowledge economy.
The success of authoritarian regimes that achieve high economic growth rates for a short period of time is not permanent and sustainable.
Therefore, the first priority is to overcome the problems we face in our country in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms, tolerance and democracy in general.
Organized industrial relations,
markets that operate according to rules,
an effective rule of law
and a highly qualified education system are among the necessary conditions for the transition to a knowledge economy.
CHP is committed to fair competition in our country,
a sound legal order
and to put in place a democratic regime that will enable all economic actors to look to the future with confidence.
