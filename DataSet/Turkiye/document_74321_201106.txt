For the free man...
The Republican People's Party is a modern social democratic party committed to the founding principles and values of the Republic.
CHP is the party of change.
CHP is the party of great transformations.
All three major transformations that Turkey has undergone on the road to liberation and democratization have the signature of the CHP.
The CHP established the Republic and gave sovereignty to the people.
The CHP ensured the transition to multi-party life and the democratic transfer of power.
The CHP brought the discussions on social democracy to Turkey's agenda
and initiated efforts to create a social state that would be a concrete supporter of freedoms.
As the inheritor of this revolutionary history, the CHP will now realize Turkey's fourth great transformation.
Under CHP rule, liberal democracy will be established in Turkey.
ATATURK'S REVOLUTIONS AND THE SIX ARROW PRINCIPLE
Our passion for independence,
The will of the people,
citizen's freedom
and our claim to be a modern society based on modernization,
They are the sources of our determination to protect and develop the ideals of Republic-Laicism-Democracy.
CHP IS LIBERTARIAN According to the CHP's understanding, freedom is the fundamental condition for the development of human personality and thought, human talents and creativity.
The self-realization of the human being in society,
to become a citizen.
CHP IS EGALITARIAN: To ensure social justice between different social strata in our country,
pursue justice in the distribution of wealth,
inequalities in income distribution,
Reducing imbalances in regional development are the primary goals of the CHP.
CHP IS SOLIDARIST: In the social democratic understanding of society and people, responsibility is shared and
solidarity is a requirement of this understanding of responsibility.
The CHP's understanding of solidarity is balanced and equitable income distribution,
social security for all,
protecting all the strays,
support for all those in need of protection are priority targets.
CHP IS PLURALIST: Deepening democracy in our country, where different social classes, beliefs, cultures and ethnic identities live, is a prerequisite for internal peace and development.
Libertarian Democracy
A new social contract for the establishment of liberal democracy in Turkey,
to expand the freedoms of everyone living in this country to the fullest extent
and a new constitution that protects them from the oppressive policies of governments.
The new constitution should be based on the principles of freedom, equality, social justice, democracy and secularism.
The Constitution should clearly state that respect for human rights is the foundation of the legitimacy of the state, social order and social peace.
The Constitution should recognize all human rights - civil, political, social, economic, economic and cultural - as integral
and protect them equally.
The process of drafting the new constitution is of great importance.
A democratic constitution is a constitution made through democratic means.
A democratic constitution is one that embraces all colors of society both in its content and in the process of its making.
Therefore, the new constitution should be drafted by a parliament whose legitimacy has not been damaged by the democratic shame of a ten percent electoral threshold.
The CHP believes that even in the short time remaining before the elections, changes can be made to lower the threshold.
One of the most important building blocks of a liberal democracy in Turkey is the strengthening of the parliamentary system.
The September 12 regime placed the executive in an overly powerful position vis-Ã -vis the legislature and the judiciary.
The legislature and the judiciary are unable to fulfill their necessary checks and balances.
Proposals such as the 'presidential system' will take this design of September 12 one step further
and open the door to one-man rule.
Further increasing the powers of the executive and neutralizing the legislature
and such practices, which strengthen the possibility of conflict between the legislature and the executive, will not bring stability,
On the contrary, it will set the stage for new crises.
Under the CHP government, the representativeness and powers of the Parliament will be increased and the
excessive powers of the executive will be limited.
Another indispensable condition of a liberal democracy is the establishment of the rule of law.
In order to guarantee the rule of law, the independence and impartiality of the judiciary must be ensured.
It has become impossible to talk about the independence of the judiciary with a High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) chaired by the Minister of Justice, with the Undersecretary of the Ministry as a member and the majority of its members determined by lists prepared at the Ministry.
Members of the judiciary are directly or indirectly under pressure from the executive.
This picture makes all judicial decisions controversial
and damages social peace.
Under the CHP government, this situation will be changed by making the necessary reforms both in the composition of the HSYK and in the material and legal infrastructure of the security of judgeship
and the independence of the judiciary will be guaranteed.
The CHP has never accepted and will never accept the de facto limitation of the powers of the parliament and the government elected by the votes of the people by any power other than the democratic rules and institutions stipulated by law.
In this context, the CHP opposes the involvement of the armed forces in politics.
The armed forces should be under the control of civilian authority.
To this end, the CHP is embarking on a comprehensive civilianization program for Turkey.
Under CHP rule, Article 35 of the Turkish Armed Forces Internal Service Law will be amended.
The Military High Administrative Court will be abolished.
Professionalism in the military will be emphasized
and compulsory military service will be reduced to six months for all in the medium term.
Civilianization will dominate both politics and society.
In a libertarian democracy, individual rights and freedoms must be respected under all circumstances.
The rights to liberty and security of the person and respect for the private life of individuals are at the heart of this order.
Turkey's current situation in terms of these rights is dismal.
As the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has recognized, detention orders in Turkey systematically violate human rights.
Arrest warrants are far from being based on legally valid grounds.
Turkish practice shows that the fact that these decisions are taken by judges does not necessarily mean that they are in accordance with the law.
Similarly, another frequently violated right is the right to respect for private life.
Illegal wiretapping and wiretapping has become the norm.
Law enforcement agencies do not address these violations
and in some cases suspicion is even focused on law enforcement agencies.
Some judges have issued mass wiretapping orders in contravention of clear provisions of the law.
Under the CHP government, these harsh practices of law enforcement and a certain section of the judiciary will be put an end to, and
citizens of the Republic of Turkey will no longer have to live in fear of 'will I be arrested if I dissent' or 'will my phones be tapped'.
Another indispensable element of libertarian democracies is freedom of thought, expression and dissemination of ideas.
There are 57 journalists imprisoned in Turkey, putting
Turkey ahead of even China and Iran.
Nearly a thousand lawsuits against journalists seeking prison sentences are still ongoing.
Media outlets that try to remain independent are intimidated with arbitrary tax fines.
Even unpublished books are subject to censorship and prosecution.
Under CHP rule, freedom of thought, expression, dissemination of expression, access to information
and all obstacles to freedom of the press will be removed.
Journalists will no longer have to fear that 'something will happen to me' while writing their articles.
No liberal democracy, no matter how well-organized its constitution, rules and institutions, can survive without the support of an organized society.
The ability of citizens to organize themselves through political parties, trade unions, professional associations and other civil society organizations, to
express their opinions freely
and to contribute effectively to the formation of political decisions are the requirements of a libertarian democracy.
There are still many obstacles to organizing in Turkey.
Both politics and civil society will be democratized under CHP rule.
Necessary amendments will be made to the Law on Political Parties and other laws to ensure that libertarian democracy prevails in these institutions as well.
The participation of all civil society organizations in decision-making processes will be recognized as a political right and a constitutional principle.
Another fundamental principle of libertarian democracy is pluralism.
Political pluralism ensures the recognition of the right to organize and represent all political groups, regardless of their voting share.
Moreover, it prepares the appropriate political ground to ensure fair competition for all political groups.
However, it requires the implementation of institutions and rules that prevent those who hold the majority from monopolizing the political sphere.
Many regulations in Turkey undermine political pluralism, such as the ten percent electoral threshold, broadly defined party bans, state subsidies that favor large parties, and obstacles that make independent candidacy difficult.
Political pluralism will be fully realized under CHP rule.
The electoral threshold will be set at a maximum of five percent.
In libertarian democracies, the principle of pluralism also applies to society.
Social differences must be recognized and protected by the legal order.
No member of a democratic society should be discriminated against on grounds such as gender, ethnicity, religion or sect.
In this sense, women are among the groups that need to be supported the most in Turkey.
Women face many problems such as violence, exclusion from education and labor force, and underrepresentation in politics.
CHP will work for the realization of equality between women and men in all areas of society.
To this end, CHP supports positive discrimination policies, including quotas, for women in all areas of social life.
The main goal of the CHP will be to solve the problems of segments of society that complain about the obstacles to social and political pluralism within the framework of full democracy.
In short, CHP will bring more freedom to Turkey, to every citizen of the Republic of Turkey.
promises more democracy.
Hand in hand with our citizens, the CHP will realize Turkey's fourth great change.
A NEW AND LIBERAL CONSTITUTION
We will implement a new and libertarian Constitution that expands and secures rights and freedoms.
In line with contemporary examples, we will draft the new Constitution with the participation and consensus of all segments of society.
To this end, we will work for the new Constitution to be drafted by a Parliament that is not scarred by the 10 percent electoral threshold.
To ensure that debates on the new Constitution take place in a free environment, we will bring the articles in criminal and political parties legislation that restrict freedom of expression in line with universal human rights law.
The new constitution will ensure the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers,
guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms and the social state,
It will be a new 'social contract' that bases the legitimacy of the state on the protection and promotion of human rights.
We will make the principle of equal, pluralist and constitutional citizenship dominant so that all our citizens can effectively exercise their democratic rights.

For sustainable development...
Producing, growing, sharing, environmentally friendly economy
Turkey entered the 2010s with serious problems after suffering significant blood losses following two major crises in 2001 and 2009.
In 2009, the year of the crisis, the economy contracted by nearly 5%.
Among 150 developing and emerging economies, Turkey ranked 51st in terms of average growth performance in the 1980-2002 period, but dropped to 71st in the 2003-2010 period when the AKP was in power.
According to purchasing power parity, Turkey, which was the world's 14th largest economy in 1987 and the world's 16th largest economy in 1999 when it became a member of the G-20, remained in 16th place during the eight years of AKP rule.
The average growth rate in Turkey is low and the volatility of the growth rate is high.
Domestic savings are insufficient.
Financing growth is dependent on external resource inflows.
The contribution of employment and total factor productivity to growth is weak.
The driving force of growth is consumption financed by short-term external resources;
a significant portion of consumption is financed directly or indirectly by imports.
Unemployment in the Turkish economy is high and the level of employment is very low.
The level of education of the labor force and the quality of jobs created are poor.
Informal employment is high.
Economic and social development is not equally distributed across regions;
regional income and welfare disparities are reinforced.
Income distribution is deteriorating and
poverty is deepening.
Industry is losing ground and the
share of industry in national income is declining.
Resources in the industrial sector are rapidly shifting to sectors with low productivity potential.
In rural areas, where a quarter of our population lives and where agricultural production is carried out, hunger and poverty are increasing more rapidly than in urban areas.
During the AKP's nine years in power, growth remained below historical averages,
the competitiveness of the economy rapidly eroded,
its dependence on foreign resources increased, and
unemployment and poverty continued to be a major problem.
The growth generated by the current economic policy and strategy in Turkey is not qualified, inclusive and sustainable.
The CHP government aims for high, stable, all-sectoral, qualified and socially balanced growth.
To this end, the country's physical, financial and human resources will be mobilized
and the prosperity to be created will be shared equitably among all segments of society.
The market mechanism will be utilized to the maximum extent in the efficient use of resources,
but the regulatory and supervisory functions of the state will be strengthened against the mistakes that the markets may make.
One of the main factors that will ensure the increase in production and efficiency is human creativity and labor.
In light of this reality, CHP sees the human being not only as a factor and object of production, but also as a subject that needs to be developed, enriched, supported and made active with its social and human existence.
Putting people and human development at the center of the economy through the social state is one of the main drivers of CHP's economic program.
In the CHP's economic vision, human development and economic development go hand in hand.
Because in today's world, where international competition sharpens every year, sustainable and qualified economic growth is only possible through continuous and long-term investments in people and technology to increase creativity and production.
CHP, which wants to achieve the targeted high growth rates in Turkey through a more balanced distribution of resources, attaches special importance to employment and factor productivity, which grows through technology and human capital.
In order to ensure an increase in factor productivity and human capital, it is necessary to revive a welfare state model that puts people and production at its center.
However, the ability of this welfare state to underwrite long-term humanitarian investment policies
and it is clear that in order to reap the fruits of these investments in the long run, policies that enhance stability at the macro level must be pursued.
To be increased through financial and institutional arrangements
and will be secured
economic stability is another important link in the CHP's economic policies
and is a sine qua non for sustainable economic and human development.
The main objective of the welfare-statist economic program, which focuses on competitive, innovative and people-oriented growth, is to ensure that Turkey's growth is balanced, sustainable and environmentally friendly.
CHP's main priority is to produce and share what it produces fairly,
inclusive, high-quality, sustainable and high-growth,
is a Turkey that spreads economic activity and prosperity evenly across regions.
A CHP government that is not dependent on imports and that thrives on investment, employment and productivity growth instead of consumption fueled by short-term foreign resources,
rapidly renewing its physical, social and technological infrastructure,
An economic order with increased competitiveness in global markets will be established.
CHP adopts a state approach that sets the rules in the economy, supervises and facilitates growth, but does not interfere in the day-to-day functioning of the economy.
CHP, minimizing environmental and ecological risks, contributing to sustainable development
and adopts a green economy model to promote human development and social justice.
CHP advocates sustainable development in harmony with nature, not "development by any means necessary".
Environmental protection is not only the right of today's citizens, but also a debt to future generations.
In the 21st century, Turkey will achieve its goal of rising above the level of contemporary civilization only by making a breakthrough in information and communication technologies,
It can achieve this by realizing the great social transformation it requires and moving to the stage of the information society.
Transforming Turkey into an information society, producing modern information technologies,
effectively utilizing informatics solutions in all problematic areas of society with other sectors
and a country that has maximized its global competitiveness.
In this way, Turkey can celebrate the centenary of the Republic as one of the world's ten largest economies.

A strong Turkey that produces, spreads prosperity to its people
In CHP government; rapidly increasing production in sectors open to competition,
Mobilizing all of its physical and human resources,
Based on efficiency,
has an economic structure that creates added value and employment,
The state acts within the framework of the principles of transparency and accountability,
Citizen rights and guarantees are at the forefront,
Employers are not subject to government arbitrariness and threats,
We promise a Turkey where the fight against poverty and unfair income distribution is a priority.
- For social justice and a decent life...
Equality and social solidarity
Turkey has not achieved a level of social and human development parallel to its economic strength.
Our country, which is emphasized to be among the 20 largest economies in the world, ranks among the last in many development assessments, especially in human development rankings.
Income distribution in Turkey is rapidly deteriorating and
poverty is deepening.
Despite favorable global economic developments, the relative poverty rate, which is based on the expenditures of our citizens to meet their basic needs, has increased during the AKP rule, rather than decreasing.
In 2009, the expenditure-based relative poverty rate rose to 15.1 percent from 14.7 percent in 2002.
The way in which social assistance is provided to families in Turkey undermines the dignity of citizens.
Social assistance does not ensure that those in need become self-sufficient.
The current system is not effective in combating social exclusion
and has not been successful in increasing labor market participation.
Social assistance is distributed unregulated and irregularly by a large number of institutions.
There is no coordination between institutions, nor is there a common database to monitor aid from a single source.
Objective criteria are not used to determine how and to whom aid is provided, and
much aid, such as food, clothing and coal, is provided indiscriminately.
The procurement and distribution of relief items is often characterized by excessive and irregular expenditures and corruption.
As a result, families who do not deserve assistance may be eligible for assistance, while those who are poor and do not directly apply to the relevant social assistance institutions do not receive assistance.
Families in real need of assistance are seen as "poor" and "needy" in their social environment
and this approach hurts them.
The CHP's main priority is to establish an order in which our citizens can live justly, honorably and humanely without worrying about the future.
CHP is a party that guarantees the freedom of its citizens,
ensuring equality and justice in all areas of social life,
is determined to build a strong social state based on equality of opportunity.
A decent life is the most fundamental right of every citizen.
A humane life can only be achieved when social welfare, happiness and income are equally shared,
This can only be possible in a system where all citizens receive an equal share of education and health services.
Eradicating poverty is among the fundamental duties and responsibilities of the state.
It should be the primary objective of the social state of law to prepare the necessary conditions for the development of the material and moral existence of citizens.
Because "social" means "related to society"; it
means "for the people".
The social democratic Republican People's Party prioritizes the creation of a strong social state in Turkey above all other goals.
The social state aims to ensure that all citizens live as independent and free human beings.
The social state guarantees the labor and bread of the people.
The social state ensures equality between citizens and justice for the whole society.
The social state strengthens social solidarity by providing equal opportunities.
The social balance necessary to preserve political and economic independence can be achieved through a strong welfare state.
Family Insurance aims to protect the family, the smallest unit of society.
Because when families are not left without food or work, it means that the whole society is protected.
The Family Insurance program, which the CHP wants to implement with great determination, is a very important step in the process of building a strong social state in Turkey.
CHP will develop a modern social security system and social protection network with Family Insurance.
Family Insurance aims to free every citizen from all forms of marginalization and eradicate poverty, regardless of faith or origin.
With Family Insurance, our citizens will not be dependent on anyone,
will live as independent, free and equal individuals.
A social support approach that guarantees the dignity of the individual and the family through objective criteria is the main starting point of the Family Insurance scheme.
CHP considers the realization of social justice that covers all segments of society as its main priority.
To this end, it is aware of the importance of developing special social support programs for social groups with fewer opportunities.
In this context, the CHP focuses its social policies especially on women, children, youth, pensioners, the disabled and the elderly.
It mobilizes the social state with all its power to ensure that these groups benefit equally from opportunities and services.
CHP believes that equality between men and women is an indisputable prerequisite for democracy and socio-economic development.
Aware that it is impossible to be a modern country without achieving gender equality, it attaches special importance to programs to empower women.
CHP sees the Family Insurance program as a fundamental step towards women's empowerment and full participation in social life.
Likewise, to implement policies that focus on women's participation in education, labor markets and politics,
is determined to save Turkey from this shame by effectively combating violence against women.
CHP recognizes that children's right to life, healthy development and good nutrition must be guaranteed in order to eliminate social inequalities.
Providing equal opportunities to all citizens at the beginning of their lives and
minimizing the impact of conditions such as the socio-economic status of the family or place of birth on children's access to life opportunities as much as possible is a sine qua non of CHP's goal of a "better society".
Economic, physical and social investments to enable children to complete their physical, emotional and intellectual development will go a long way in combating social inequalities.
One of the primary goals of the CHP is to provide young people with every opportunity to live their youth in public and private life.
CHP is free from the pressures of young people,
where they can develop their personalities freely,
prepare all kinds of environments where they can use their creativity
and is committed to bringing young people under the full protection of the welfare state so that they can overcome the economic obstacles that stand in their way.
The CHP's approach to youth will take into account all young people living in Turkey from different backgrounds, and will
recognize the "invisible youth", especially girls at home and young people who work and study.
CHP will not give up on a single young person in Turkey and will take

Public services are vital for ensuring social welfare, development and justice, and for improving the quality of life of citizens.
Effective outreach of social policies to citizens,
empowerment of the needy and vulnerable,
protection of the family,
promotion of personal responsibility and independence are important factors that strengthen human development.
Basic services such as education and health must be provided to all citizens on the basis of rights.
A country's modernization,
social development, and the
ability of its citizens to live as free, well-equipped and happy individuals depend on the most effective delivery of public services to citizens.
Public services enable citizens to live their lives in the most efficient way possible,
It also aims to protect them from risks and dangers that they would find difficult to tackle alone.
As a social democratic political party, one of the main objectives of the CHP is to provide quality and comprehensive services to the public.
Since the public sector plays a primary role in providing a significant portion of the services to be provided to the public, it is one of the main priorities of the CHP to deliver these services to citizens in the most efficient way.
CHP aims to provide social services effectively and extensively throughout Turkey with a modern understanding of social services, future-oriented investments and new regulations.
To provide basic services such as education, health and minimum social security, which are the rights of citizenship, to all citizens without discrimination

The ongoing disarray in the institutional structure is a major source of problems.
At the same time, the health sector faces economic and social damage caused by significant rent-seeking structures, illegality and corruption.
Health is the most vital human need and the most fundamental element of social and economic policies.
Contemporary social democracy regards health as a fundamental right
and aims to provide quality, sustainable and equitable health services, which have taken on new dimensions and become more expensive with the development of the knowledge economy.
Poverty reduction in the context of health-related social goals,
regional service distribution to be made equitable,
breakthroughs in educational and social infrastructures and in the field of information and communication technologies,
Women's equal access to health services is a priority goal of the CHP.
CHP is determined to build a fast, safe and affordable transportation system that supports growth and development and to provide equal opportunities for all citizens.
CHP's main priority in transportation is to ensure the efficient use of resources and our transportation potential
and to realize a modern structuring.
Thus, a balanced, effective and efficient planning, coordination and guidance will be ensured in land, sea, air and railway transportation networks.
The right to the environment is a universal human right.

- For modern settlements and developed urban society...
Developing regions, urbanizing Anatolia, world city Istanbul
Under CHP rule, the basic principles of the new municipalism approach centered on social policies, environmental policies and entrepreneurship will be reintroduced in local governments.
In this way, local governments will regain their resource-creating, productive, consumption-regulating, solidaristic and democratic character.
Municipalities will be saved from being an instrument of rent creation.
The wasting of public resources and powers in the name of unjust gains that serve certain interest groups will be prevented.
Thanks to the publicization of urban rent, these resources will be returned to city dwellers as services.
In order to achieve this, all decision-making processes, especially zoning plans, will be transformed into a transparent and accountable structure and functioning.
The urban transformation process will be restructured in harmony with nature and the city as a whole, and with an understanding that respects historical, cultural and social heritage.
Necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the resource allocation of local governments is free from all kinds of ideological and partisan discrimination.
Service areas of local governments will be clearly defined, and
ambiguities and overlaps of authority in these areas will be prevented.
Instead of a local development approach based on competition among local units, inter-city solidarity mechanisms based on cooperation and exchange of experience in service delivery will be implemented.
It will be built in a democratic and participatory perspective with the idea that local governments are the cradle of democracy.
In particular, the "neighborhood" will be highlighted as a collective representation unit, paving the way for urban residents to come together at the grassroots level to express their demands, expectations and needs.
Steps will be taken to increase the function of the local press in producing and circulating information about the city.
Direct participation mechanisms such as referendum and recall will be implemented to ensure that the people have a direct say in governance.
In addition to enriching and diversifying the geography of production and consumption in all our cities, CHP will focus on the
establishment of rich public spaces such as universities, libraries, congress centers, sports halls and stadiums, especially educational institutions, and on
increasing the quantity and quality of basic art activities, cultural activities and sports activities.
In other words, CHP will create an environment in cities where a real urban culture is presented to citizens.
In Turkey, interregional inequalities are constantly increasing
and this situation leads to many problems such as intensive migration from rural to urban and between cities, social injustice, waste of resources, and cultural incompatibilities.
Central Anatolia, Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia and the Black Sea Region have experienced relative stagnation and even economic decline over the last decade.
As a result of this stagnation and decline, these regions emigrated,
their number of parliamentary seats declined
and consequently lost political representation.
In order to prevent this blood loss, the CHP will implement the "Southeastern and Eastern Anatolia", "Black Sea" and "Central Anatolia" development plans as soon as possible.
CHP supports regional economic and social development
and eliminating inequalities between regions as priority objectives.
Turkey has world-class resources in terms of agricultural potential.
With this in mind, strengthening the agricultural sector
and ensuring rural development is an indispensable policy for CHP.
On the other hand, considering that most of our population now lives in cities, CHP sees Turkey primarily as an urban society.
From this point of view, solving many problems of our cities such as poverty, unemployment, housing, infrastructure and environment are among our main priorities.
CHP puts forward a vision for the economic and social development of our country that envisages faster development of our cities in cooperation with each other.
Under CHP rule, urban growth centers will be established all over Turkey
and economic cooperation will be ensured between these centers and their sub-centers.
CHP will turn twenty cities in different geographical regions of Turkey into centers of economic attraction.
Therefore, it will make these cities with a population of one million people important actors of the national and international economy by concentrating them in certain activities according to their wealth.
Another aim of this breakthrough is to ensure the healthy urbanization of Anatolia and reduce the burden on our major metropolises.
Local governments

We will establish a structure where central governments will share services with local administrations, not to avoid responsibility but to ensure efficiency in public services.
We will ensure service integrity between central and local governments.
We will establish city reconciliation boards that will function in transparent structures where disputes between local governments and citizens will be resolved without resorting to the judiciary.
Integrity and harmony will be ensured between planning legislation and local government legislation,
We will carry out a comprehensive reform of zoning legislation.
We will put an end to "indebted municipalism" that creates deeper relations of dependency.
We will intervene in processes of financial dependency that pit weak local governments against powerful multinational corporations and financial institutions.
STRONGER MUNICIPALITIES
We will reopen municipalities that were closed on the grounds that they were first-tier municipalities or had a population below 2 thousand.
We will expand the boundaries of municipalities and
increase the number of municipalities.
We will remove population as the sole criterion for establishing municipalities and allocating resources, and will take into account
We will also take into account the historical and geographical situation, economic and social structure of the regions and the functions between settlements.
We will increase the revenues of local governments to enable them to fulfill the duties assigned to them.
Within the framework of the "All Turkey Municipality" approach, we will associate villages with a municipal administration and
give them a share from the General Budget Tax Revenues.
MUKHTAR SYSTEM WILL GAIN THE IMPORTANCE IT DESERVES
We will raise the salaries of mukhtars to the level of net minimum wage and
ensure that their social security premiums are paid by the state.
We will create the necessary infrastructure for mukhtars to provide services according to the requirements of the age, and
improve their personal rights and working conditions.
We will restructure mukhtars as the most extreme service unit and
ensure that neighborhood mukhtars have a voice in municipal councils.
In big cities, it will reduce the size of neighborhood mukhtars' offices by dividing large neighborhoods,
over time, we will organize it so that it does not exceed 10,000 inhabitants.
We will also give Muhtars active roles in Neighborhood Councils.
Neighborhood mukhtars will have a voice in Municipal Assemblies and village mukhtars in Provincial General Assemblies.
Better governance of villages by amending the Village Law,
village mukhtars to better fulfill their function as representatives of the state in the village,
We will ensure that village guards are reintroduced in villages where they are needed.

We will create an Istanbul where all kinds of people are accepted, where different identities live in peace and where diversity is seen as a positive force.
We will make Istanbul a representative of tolerance in the region where differences live in harmony.
For a multicultural urban environment that will increase creative activities and productivity, we will adopt a broad understanding of tolerance by local governments as an indispensable prerequisite for a vibrant and enriched urban life.
We will approach Istanbul as a tolerant city project where every religion, sect, ethnic group, race, sexual orientation, gender and nationality can live freely.

For a just and safe world...
Foreign policy based on peace, democracy and development
Under CHP rule, Turkey's foreign policy will be shaped on the basis of values that aim to create a just world for all people.
CHP and Turkey know their responsibilities in the international community,
cooperating in all areas to achieve common goals,
who set an example with his diplomatic courtesy,
will stand out as a reliable and reputable member.
CHP will make Turkey a regional center of peace, development and democracy.
CHP foreign policy will be 'citizen-centered'.
The main axis of the CHP's foreign policy is to increase the security and prosperity of the citizens of the Republic of Turkey, wherever they live in the world.
To this end, CHP will ensure that the legitimate rights of our citizens arising from international law are defended and protected in the most effective manner before every country and on every ground.
The CHP believes that foreign policy should protect the rights and interests of every citizen.
Therefore, it is important to seek the views of all segments of society when formulating foreign policy,
to ensure their interest and contribution.
Under the CHP government, a mechanism of exchange of views on foreign policy issues will be established by ensuring a regular flow of information with all relevant institutions and organizations, especially the political parties with a group in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
Civil society's contribution to foreign policy decision-making will be activated
and institutionalized.
In other words, under the CHP government, the foreign policy field will be democratized, just like every other policy field.
The CHP's 'values-based foreign policy' has its intellectual and historical sources in the history of the Republic and social democracy.
In this context, the 10 main principles that will shed light on the CHP's foreign policy can be listed as follows: CHP's foreign policy will be peaceful.
Pacifism is one of the most important goals that our founding leader Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk set for us with the phrase "peace at home, peace in the world".
In this context, the CHP will ensure that all foreign policy problems are resolved peacefully and diplomatically.
The use of force will not be an option unless Turkey is subjected to an armed attack or we are requested to do so by the international community in accordance with international law.
Under CHP rule, Turkey's foreign policy will be egalitarian.
Turkey will pay attention to the principles that every country and every nation, regardless of its size and power, is equal, has equal rights and should be respected equally.
Turkey will not be a "big brother" to any country, but will approach all its interlocutors as "equal partners".
In a CHP government, we will think about what we can learn together with every partner, every neighbor.
Another fundamental principle of Turkish foreign policy will be respect for human rights and freedoms.
Turkey will provide effective support to all efforts carried out by international institutions, in accordance with international law, to ensure that human rights values and rules prevail in every corner of the world.
In this sense, Turkey will set an example for its neighbors and the region by fully protecting human rights in its own country and deepening democracy.
CHP's foreign policy will be solidarist.
Solidarity with underdeveloped and developing countries is vital for the CHP, a member of the Socialist International, which aims to build a more just world.
CHP will support steps to ensure that every country gets its fair share of the world's prosperity and that global institutions and rules lay the groundwork for fair representation and sharing.
Contribute to the reform of global governance institutions, in particular the United Nations, accordingly.
With one foot in the developed world and one foot in the developing world, Turkey will be a key facilitator for a cooperative relationship between these two groups.
Another indispensable principle of Turkey's foreign policy will be respect for international law
and trust in multilateral institutions.
The CHP believes that ensuring the rule of law is vital for ensuring social peace and order both within and between countries.
International law constitutes the most important basis of legitimacy in international relations.
The diligence of the founders of the Republic, who were fully aware of this understanding, to fulfill the debts arising from international law from the earliest days of the country's history is still remembered.
CHP will continue this legacy
and be a model country by fully respecting its international obligations in every field.
Another important issue necessitated by international law and globalization is that countries should refrain from making unilateral decisions and imposing them on other countries
, and that decisions affecting international relations should be taken in multilateral institutions or groups, in consultation with stakeholders and in cooperation.
The CHP will follow this principle in all its regional and global policies and will
refrain from imposing decisions.
CHP believes that multilateral institutions are the most important tool for developing appropriate solutions in today's transboundary world, where all problems, from trade to the environment, from finance to migration, are transboundary in nature.
One of the most important principles of the foreign policy to be implemented under the CHP is integrationism.
Commercial, financial, cultural and scientific integration between countries, as seen in the case of the European Union (EU), goes beyond classical cooperation
and yields much more lasting and effective results.
With such integrations, both increasing welfare
and consolidating peace is an important international goal for social democrats.
With this understanding, CHP will resolutely continue its efforts to integrate with the EU,
also accelerate its efforts to integrate regionally.
In this context, the conclusion of free trade agreements, agreements on mutual promotion and protection of investments, free movement arrangements, scientific, cultural and educational cooperation agreements will be accelerated
and more importantly, effective implementation of these agreements will be ensured.
With these integration efforts, Turkey will be placed at the center of global mobility on the North-South and East-West axes.
With CHP policies, Turkey will not only open up to the world, but also integrate with the world.
A very important area that needs to be emphasized in the CHP's integrationist policies is economic diplomacy.
The qualifications and quantity of foreign economic relations experts will be increased.
Legal and institutional facilities will be increased to enable entrepreneurs who trade and invest abroad to report obstacles and receive state protection.
Protecting the legitimate rights of our entrepreneurs and increasing investment opportunities will be among our prioritized foreign policy objectives.
The European orientation, which was deeply rooted in the history of Turkish foreign policy, would be continued under the CHP government.
CHP defines Europe as a set of values based on democracy, human rights and the social state.
Being part of a Europe defined in this way will strengthen Turkey.
Turkey's EU accession process came to a standstill due to the mistakes of the AKP government and the behavior of other conservative parties in Europe.
The only thing that can save this process is the cooperation of the CHP and other European social democratic parties whose ideas are rooted in universalism.
CHP initiated Turkey's candidacy for EU membership and
CHP will bring this process to a happy end.
As a social democratic party that builds its ties with Europe on universal values, another important principle that the CHP will emphasize in its foreign policy will be universalism.
The AKP, which claims to oppose the clash of civilizations thesis, maintains an introverted civilizationalist discourse and
is influenced by its religious or ethnic-based prejudices in determining its policies.
Under a CHP government, this understanding will end and
relations with all countries will be based on universal values.
The CHP will resolutely continue its policy of building regional peace and security alliances, one of the most important features of the Republican foreign policy.
As seen in examples such as the Sadabad Pact, the Balkan Pact, and Turkish-Greek relations during the AtatÃ¼rk-Venizelos period, the decision-makers of the Republic have always attached special importance to establishing peace and security alliances in their immediate regions.
The Cold War period, with its structural changes, made it impossible to pursue this policy.
A return to this policy with the end of the Cold War would mean the continuation of a rational Republican policy.
CHP will work to make all our neighbors our allies as well.
Finally, the CHP's foreign policy will be shaped on the basis of realism.
There will be no room for adventurism, hamas, or irresponsible behavior based on domestic political concerns in CHP foreign policy.
The CHP will reject the approach that tries to do everything at the same time in foreign policy without achieving positive results in any area, and will emphasize
a policy with well-defined priorities, focusing its energy on its priorities and respecting the courtesy required by diplomatic life.
With its consistent values-based and citizen-centered policies, the CHP will repair relations damaged under the AKP, pave the
way for Turkey's EU membership
and make Turkey a regional center of peace, development and democracy.
EU MEMBERSHIP
CHP is in favor of Turkey's EU membership.
It sees EU membership as a social transformation project for the democratization of Turkey and the readiness of its economy for the information age.
CHP started Turkey's EU process and
CHP will bring it to a happy end.
The CHP, together with European social democrats, will overcome the current stalemate in Turkey-EU relations through discourse based on universal values.
Under CHP leadership, Turkey will develop projects for the future of the EU until EU membership is realized,
will actively participate in the debate on the future EU.
CHP believes that social democrats should unite under the umbrella of the EU to establish a just, peaceful and libertarian order in the world.
In our relations with the EU, we will aim for full membership on equal terms with other members.
We will resolutely demand that EU membership conditions are applied equally to all candidate states, in line with the ideal of a solidary Europe.
With this understanding, we will strongly support the acceleration and finalization of a reform process in line with EU legislation and the practices of other member states.
First and foremost, we will put an end to justified concerns that Turkey is moving away from compliance with the Copenhagen criteria by implementing liberal democracy with all its institutions and institutions.
We will insist on the lifting of EU restrictions on free movement, agricultural subsidies, regional development.
Linking Turkey's EU membership to the Cyprus issue;
We will not accept our accession process being tied to preconditions and unilateral concessions.
On the Cyprus issue, we will underline in every environment that taking into account the legitimate demands of the Turkish Cypriot people by the EU authorities is the most appropriate policy for European ideals.
Together with all our social democratic partners, we will work to explain to the people of Europe that Turkey's full membership of the EU is the best way to disprove the clash of civilizations political movements whose visibility is reaching alarming proportions.
RELATIONS WITH THE USA
We will overcome the difficulties in relations with the US in recent years and move forward with a new understanding based on equality, mutual respect and observing each other's legitimate interests.
Not limited to strategic and military relations with the US,
We will build a new and modern partnership, balanced and open to economic and cultural interaction.
To counterbalance the growing anti-Americanism in Turkey, we will implement confidence-building measures such as the exchange of students, businesspeople and local officials between Turkey and the US, and the organization of joint cultural and artistic events.
MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND ALLIANCE RELATIONS:
We will make effective contributions to the international organizations of which Turkey is a member, not only on our own national problems, but also on all issues of interest to these organizations.
We will demonstrate at every opportunity that we are a responsible member of the international community.
To preserve world peace, we will put at the center of our policy the prohibition of all countries from using or threatening to use force as enshrined in the UN Charter, and we will
demand that all other states fully respect this prohibition.
All members of international organizations such as the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE, OECD, UNESCO, OIC, BSEC, etc. to act in equality,
to contribute
and we will advocate for their benefit.
We will support efforts to ensure that such organizations are no longer an arena for great powers.
A key condition for maintaining world peace is to close the economic gaps between countries.
We will support new international initiatives and arrangements to establish a new and equitable economic order in the world.
We will ensure that Turkey plays a leading role in the design of these initiatives and arrangements We will
continue to strengthen our relations with NATO, of which we are an active member.
NATO effectively fulfills its mandate to maintain peace and stability as a deterrent force
and we will support a redefinition of NATO's position in today's environment, with greater emphasis on maintaining international peace and security.
CYPRUS
CHP will support all negotiations for a just settlement of the Cyprus problem acceptable to both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
CHP calls for a permanent solution to the Cyprus problem
and will work with all its strength to make the Eastern Mediterranean a basin of peace.
Turkey believes that the Cyprus problem should be solved by preserving the acquired rights of the TRNC and the Turkish people of Northern Cyprus.
and political equality of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.
The Turkish Cypriots are the basis of Turkey's presence and guarantor rights in Cyprus.
Turkey's relations with the TRNC will develop in accordance with the principle of the sovereign equality of the Turkish Cypriots, respecting the democratic will of the Turkish Cypriots and not interfering in their internal affairs.
Turkey will continue to support Turkish Cypriots as long as they want to.
In this context, the CHP will be criticizing the AKP administration's threats of financial and economic sanctions against the Turkish Cypriot people, who are struggling with international embargoes.
and strongly condemns any discourse that would hurt the dignity of Turkish Cypriots.
The TRNC, an independent and democratic state recognized by the Republic of Turkey, will be fully respected as required by the rules of international diplomacy and the sovereign equality of states.
The Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus does not represent Turkish Cypriots.
Turkish Cypriots were deprived of their right to representation in the international arena.
Until Turkish Cypriots gain equal representation, Turkey will continue to provide all necessary support for their representation in all areas.
All political, diplomatic and legal initiatives will be taken to lift the embargoes against the TRNC and the practices that result in the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots from the world.
