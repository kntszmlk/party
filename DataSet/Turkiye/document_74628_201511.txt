As the AK Party, we set out with the claim of being the party of Turkey, we moved forward with this claim, and we solved many of Turkey's accumulated and chronic problems with this understanding.
We did this in line with the expectations and needs of our nation and by protecting the values of our nation.
While providing our services, we did not look at which belief system, sect, origin, culture and income level our citizens belonged to.
We have taken important steps towards making our country a strong rule of law.
We built the AK Party's understanding of politics on the principles of democracy, service and responsibility.
We ended politics, which had been battered for years, eroded trust, and lost its ability to represent the nation, and we rebuilt the political sphere by establishing a strong bond between politics and the nation.
In this journey, we have always aimed to take our democracy further.
One of the raison d'Ãªtre of the AK Party has been to expand the fundamental rights and freedoms of our citizens.
We have expressed this goal in all our election manifestos and government programs so far.
On the other hand, we have improved the quality of our management and produced more services with fewer resources.
We have demonstrated with our concrete practices that democracy also empowers our development process.
Democratization in the new period
and we will continue to improve our management quality.
In countries where democracy is advanced and fundamental rights are guaranteed, the scientific mindset and innovative production flourish faster.
In the coming period, with the reforms we will make with the new constitution, the progress of our democracy
and the further improvement of our management quality;
On the one hand, it will accelerate economic development, it will accelerate our human development,
On the other hand, it will make Turkey a more respected and attractive country in the international arena.
As the Justice and Development Party, we will continue our democratization efforts after November 1st.
Where everyone can live as they believe,
where they can express their ideas freely,
contributes to prosperity
and its rightful share of prosperity,
as a society living in safety and peace
we will walk into the future together.
1.1. Fundamental Rights and Freedoms
The AK Party considers individual rights and freedoms and the elevation of human dignity as the fundamental moral reference of the new constitution.
With this reference, we continue to see it as a fundamental duty to guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms of our citizens and to eliminate the obstacles that restrict their exercise.
With our understanding of standing at an equal distance to all social segments, we embrace our unity based on the fundamental values of our nation and the bond of citizenship.
We believe that relations between the state and citizens should be based on justice and democracy, and we continue to embrace all our citizens with a pluralistic approach.
Our historical experience, our accumulation of ancient civilization, our spiritual values that elevate human beings are the assurance that we build fundamental rights and freedoms on a solid ground in today's world.
In the new Turkey, our motto is to realize a stronger understanding that embraces everyone, regardless of their ethnic identity, sect and belief, and brings them to a democratic consciousness of coexistence on the basis of equal citizenship and universal principles and values.
a. What We Did

Among these; paving the way for our citizens to exercise their natural rights such as belief, sect and cultural identity
and the initiation of the solution process.

As soon as we came to power, we accelerated the normalization process by lifting the state of emergency.
Expansion of cultural rights
and we have taken steps to make the education system more democratic and pluralistic.
We made it possible to broadcast in different languages and dialects on official state channels.
We have made it possible for prisoners and convicts to meet with their relatives in their mother tongue, for our citizens to give their children the names they desire, for academic studies to be conducted in different languages and dialects at universities, for institutes to be established, for these to be taught as elective courses in secondary education institutions, and finally, for private schools to be opened that offer education in different languages and dialects.
We lifted bans on political propaganda, cinema, video and music in different languages and dialects.
We supported cultural activities within this framework.
We ensured that fears, taboos and prohibitions were overcome, that society and the state confronted their own problems, and that problems that had been growing for years because they could not be talked about could be openly discussed and debated.
We strengthened the sense of belonging of all our citizens, including our citizens of Kurdish origin, by demonstrating the will to overcome their problems in the field of fundamental rights and freedoms
and we have taken important steps for social restoration.

As of 2014, the total number of associations and foundations in Turkey reached 104,317 and 4,757, respectively.
b. What We Will Do
In the period ahead, AK Party will resolutely protect the gains we have made in the field of fundamental rights and freedoms in the past.
Our main priority for the upcoming period will be to make our regulations a part of life through a mindset transformation and effective implementation, and to improve the quality of our regulations.
As in the past, we will oppose the imposition of identity and lifestyle on society in the second breakthrough period.
Where all our citizens are treated as first class
and we will continue to build an environment where they live as free individuals.
We will continue to reinforce our unity and integrity within an understanding of citizenship based on inclusive and universal values.
It stands at an equal distance to all ethnic, sectarian and religious groups, to all our citizens, headscarved or uncovered, peasant or urban, male or female, poor or rich, of one political view or another;
We aim for a Turkey where every individual will enjoy the most advanced level of fundamental rights and freedoms.
Our unity in the historical journey where the fundamental values of our nation are kneaded before ethnic, religious and sectarian affiliations
and equal citizenship.
With this understanding, the state should work with all social segments on the basis of equality and fairness.
and develop a democratic relationship;
We will continue to embrace all elements of our social wealth with a pluralistic approach.
We will continue to respect the way of life of every individual in society.
In line with the goal of social reconciliation,
we will continue our policies to maintain all identities and lifestyles as a richness.
We will take the necessary steps on the basis of democratic consensus in dialogue with Alevi opinion leaders on various issues such as cemevis, healthy information in the education system, creating research and application centers in universities.
At this point, we will grant legal status to traditional wisdom centers and cemevis.
Likewise, we will make the necessary amendments to Municipal Law No. 5393, Zoning Law No. 3194 and Electricity Market Law No. 6446 to meet the needs of traditional wisdom centers and cemevis.
In the coming period, we will accelerate the solution of the problems of our Roma citizens, especially employment, housing and education problems, and eliminate all grounds for discrimination.
We will continue to take all necessary legal and practical measures to ensure that minorities who are citizens of the Republic of Turkey can lead a dignified life without any discrimination.
Our goal of pluralist, egalitarian and participatory democracy will take Turkey even higher in the league of world democracies.
International norms in the field of fundamental rights and freedoms will be the basis for all our policies in the future.
We will eliminate deficiencies in fundamental rights and freedoms.
We will organize the part of the new constitution on fundamental rights according to these principles.
We will design the political, administrative, judicial and economic order of the state in a way that puts human dignity and fundamental rights at the center.
In this framework, we will activate the Human Rights Inquiry Commission of the TGNA, the Ombudsman's Office and the Human Rights Institution of Turkey.
We will take the necessary measures to ensure that these institutions fulfill the responsibilities Turkey has assumed under the ECHR and the UN.
We will effectively monitor prisons and detention centers and resolutely address complaints against law enforcement.
We will define and implement rules for political ethics.
We will increase the level of legislative and practical harmonization with the ECtHR, Venice Commission and other international fundamental rights mechanisms.
We will continue to incorporate international conventions on fundamental rights and freedoms into domestic law and remove annotations that are incompatible with the logic of a libertarian democratic order.
In the coming period, we will prepare a framework legislation and regulate areas such as the legal status, institutional structures, activities, relations with public institutions and financial resources of civil society organizations with a holistic and democratic approach.
We will enact a framework law on the "Development and Strengthening of Civil Society" that regulates areas such as the legal status, institutional structures, activities, relations with public institutions and financial resources of civil society organizations.
We will introduce separate financial reporting standards for non-profit organizations.
We will provide training seminars and international exchange programs for CSOs and public authorities to better understand the mutual role of CSOs and public authorities.
We will make the Economic and Social Council work effectively.
The resolution process corresponds to a historic effort for the democratization, national unity, brotherhood and prosperity of our country.
From the first day we came to power, we have shaped our politics with the perspective of national unity and brotherhood.
We have adopted a political understanding that clearly states that understandings that undermine the belonging of our citizens to our state, that see the differences of our nation as a threat instead of a richness, do not befit our country and our state.
As AK Party, we have transformed the perspective of national unity and brotherhood from a passive approach to an active approach to problems that have become chronic due to the neglect of the past.
Throughout our recent history, we have tackled problems with courage and determination that no elected government has ever shown.
The turning point of the Kurdish question, one of the fundamental problems of the history of the Republic, was the speech of our Founding President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan, as Prime Minister, in Diyarbakir in 2005.
With this speech, taboos were broken and it was stated that a solution to the problem would be found within the democratic process.
For the first time, a government has had the courage to face the problem openly.
Various terrorist attacks and provocative actions tried to disrupt this courageous step of the AK Party, yet the determination to solve this fundamental and historic problem of our country was maintained.
We have implemented a series of administrative and legal reforms to end terrorism and anti-democratic practices.
Determined to carry out the processes of ending terrorism and democratization together, we announced the "Democratic Initiative" in 2009 in consultation with civil society organizations, academics and representatives of political parties.
With this work, also known as the National Unity and Brotherhood Project, we have set out the framework for the democratic steps to be taken, while working to eliminate the source of terrorism.
In 2013, we further matured the National Unity and Brotherhood Project and continued it in a multidimensional perspective under the name "Resolution Process".
During this time, we have repaired the problematic state-citizen relations that had cost us dearly in the old Turkey,
We eliminated many anti-democratic practices that created victimization.
As AK Party, we have deepened our democracy by openly confronting problems that in the old Turkey would have been hesitant to even mention.
We ended the policies of rejection, denial and assimilation.
In April 2013, the 63-member Wise People's Committee, appointed by the Government, carried out activities across Turkey, while the Commission established in the Turkish Grand National Assembly for the purpose of "Investigating the Pathways to Social Peace and Evaluating the Resolution Process" also carried out a separate study.
On December 2, 2013, the Parliamentary Commission released a 450-page report on the resolution process.
On October 1, 2013, Prime Minister ErdoÄan announced the Democratization Package, and in 2014, progress continued in the solution process with amendments such as those allowing campaigning in languages other than Turkish in elections.
On July 10, 2014, the "Law on Ending Terrorism and Strengthening Social Integration", popularly known as the "Resolution Process Law", entered into force.
The law regulated the procedures and principles regarding the resolution process.
On October 1, 2014, we issued the Council of Ministers Decree on the "Establishment of the Resolution Process Board and Inter-Agency Monitoring and Coordination Commissions".
As AK Party, we have taken steps in democratization, mainly to establish an environment of freedom that all our citizens will benefit from.
As we took these steps, each time we openly invited our political parties to support our process of national unity and brotherhood.
Our party has underlined that constitutional change is essential for democratic steps and called for a new social contract under the roof of the Parliament.
Although the opposition parties turned a deaf ear to these calls, the AK Party did not hesitate to take the vast majority of democratization steps that did not require constitutional amendments.
Our citizens have shown great favoritism to these steps and have strongly embraced the Resolution Process.
With the 20th century Turkey's most costly problem, we clearly declared with the Resolution Process that we would not allow our nation to pay heavy bills by capturing Turkey's 21st century.
At this point, the Resolution Process has become a recipe for peace and tranquility not only in our country but also in our region.
At a time when 'bloody processes' were deepening in our region, we ensured that our country was known for 'peace processes'.
In this respect, the Resolution Process is a model of unity and brotherhood not only for the democratization of Turkey and the relief of suffering, but also for our region.
The Resolution Process is the well-being project of our nation.
The Resolution Process is the guarantee that our sufferings in World War I and the Balkan War, of which we realize the centennial, will not be experienced again.
The Resolution Process is the roadmap for Turkey's normalization.
The Resolution Process is the guarantee that the anti-democratic practices of the old Turkey will not repeat themselves again.
The Resolution Process is one of the important dynamics of the AK Party, which puts human dignity at the center, to achieve human development and 2023 goals.
The solution process is also a process of prosperity for our entire country, especially in the East and Southeast.
The Resolution Process is a move to disrupt the games of those who want to put shackles on the feet of our nation and our state, those who want to impose costs.
The Resolution Process is an indigenous initiative focused on human rights and democracy, implemented for the establishment of justice and the continuity of development.
As AK Party, after June 7, we will resolutely continue the Resolution Process, which aims to establish unity and brotherhood in the country and which we do not see as a periodic issue.
We will guarantee the protection of democratic rights and freedoms in the new constitution.
We will continue to improve and expand freedoms.
Simultaneously with democratization, we will accelerate and continue our efforts for the economic and social rehabilitation of our regions affected by terrorism, particularly the development of investment, production and employment opportunities.
With the "Law No. 6551 on Ending Terrorism and Strengthening Social Integration", which we enacted in order to secure and finalize the Resolution Process and to establish permanent peace, we will take all necessary measures to reach a point where the gun is completely off the agenda.
As AK Party, we will maintain our perspective on the Resolution Process, which aims to establish public order, unity and brotherhood and which we do not see as a periodic issue.
The addressee and owner of the solution process is the nation, and the carrier is everyone who wants peace, stability and peace in our country, especially the AK Party.
The terrorist organization, which tried to sabotage and disrupt the solution process as in previous processes, has returned to armed conflict by destroying the public order.
The terrorist organization turned to illegality, violence and oppression and declared war on the solution process.
The organization, which broke its promises made in 2013 and resorted to all kinds of pressure, violence and illegality instead of complete inaction, did not leave Turkey and resisted the commitment to 'lay down arms'.
Seeing the solution process as a threat to its existence, the organization started terrorist acts again.
The AK Party government maintains its principled stance and political position of the first day.
However, the terrorist organization's actions and sabotage have made the process unsustainable.
It is an absolute necessity to establish a balance between freedom and security by consolidating public order in order to protect the rights and laws of the people.
The government aims to ensure that citizens are not victimized in the fight against terrorism, but rather to establish a public order that guarantees the fundamental rights of citizens.
AK Party is about reforms,
services,
will never give up or step back from investments.
It is the primary duty of the state to eliminate the security risks that arise for various reasons during the process and to protect the people of the region from the oppression of the tyrannical and oppressive organization.
The architect, executor and locomotive of the solution process is the AK Party.
A strong AK Party is important for the process to reach a conclusion.
It is our moral, humanitarian and conscientious duty to bring this process to a conclusion.
Despite the structures that disrupt, poison and sabotage the process, we firmly believe that we will reach our goals by maintaining the balance between freedom and security.
Our fight against terrorism until public order is restored;
We will continue to protect our understanding of the Solution Process until law and brotherhood are fully established.
1.2. New Constitution
The Justice and Development Party is the representative of a political understanding that is based on people and freedoms and sees the state and its institutions as a means of serving people.
Since the day it was founded, our party has argued that Turkey needs a civilian constitution and that a new pluralist and libertarian constitution should be drafted for this purpose.
The new constitution should reflect the modern understanding of democracy, be drafted with the widest possible consensus and democratic methods, and be embraced by broad social segments.
We believe that the Constitution should be inclusive, embracing, integrative, advocating unity in diversity, pluralist and libertarian.
The new constitution should be based on individual freedoms, include institutional safeguards to ensure judicial independence and impartiality, and remove uncertainties in the functioning of the political system.
With this understanding, we see the new constitution as a vital stage in the second breakthrough period for the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Turkey.
a. What We Did
As AK Party, we liquidated the tutelage system institutionalized by the coups of the past and opened the doors to a politics based on social values and legitimacy.
In the past, uncivilian constitutions have taken the exercise of sovereignty away from the nation and given it to the bureaucratic institutions envisaged in the constitution.
The administrative structure was designed to be rigidly centralized so that these structures, which were not based on the approval of the people, could keep the country under control.
As a result, our people have become alienated from the state, the law and the judiciary.
People's trust in parliament and civilian politics has been shaken.
The culture of democracy has weakened.
The concentration of power in bureaucratic institutions and at the center, and the exclusion of society from central or local decision-making processes, fed the desire to usurp sovereignty by seizing these institutions instead of engaging in politics through democratic means.
Each coup d'Ã©tat has caused Turkey to move further away from democracy institutionally.
Each coup has placed ideological and institutional barriers to the normalization of society.
With each intervention, it became more difficult for society to build democracy.
Despite everything, society continued to insist on democracy and protected the ballot box.
Despite all the impositions, it patiently demonstrated its democratic reaction.
In the 2002 elections, our people ended this period with the AK Party government.
The ruling AK Party has pioneered this democratic demand and fought for the construction of a democratic constitutional order so that our society would not pay any more price and continues to do so.
In our 13 years in power, we ended the tutelage structures and prohibitionist understanding caused by coups;
We have endeavored to repair and heal the damage it has done to our intellectual, cultural, social and political life.
We insisted on democratization and continued reforms.
We paved the way for civilian politics to have a say in Turkey's destiny and for the transformation of mentality necessary for the construction of a democratic constitutional order.
In the past 13 years, we have taken important steps to establish our democracy on a solid and permanent basis and to ensure that people from all walks of life enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms to the fullest extent.
These are steps that reduce the distance between the state and society, in other words, steps that restore and reinforce our nation's sense of belonging and trust in its state.
As AK Party governments, we listened to the voices of our citizens, whose demands, especially for rights and freedoms, were ignored due to the security perspective and tutelage institutions in the previous period.
By striking a balance between security and freedom, we have endeavored to meet the legitimate demands of our citizens to the fullest extent, without making any distinction between them.
Turkey has become civilized and the will of the people has become the dominant will.
In this process, our people directly elected the President with their own will, the National Security Council was civilianized, the jurisdiction of the military judiciary was narrowed, the Emasya Protocol was abolished, the practice of military members in some public institutions and organizations was ended, judicial remedies were opened against the decisions of the Supreme Military Council, and the obstacles to the trial of the September 12 coup plotters were removed.
Article 35 of the Turkish Armed Forces Internal Service Law, which has been used as a justification for coups since May 27, was reorganized in a democratic spirit.
We also established a parliamentary commission of inquiry on the fight against coups
and with the report prepared, we informed the public about the causes and consequences of coups.
The steps taken by the AK Party in this process indicate that we are passing through a historic turning point in achieving the great and powerful Turkey of the future.
While our country rises to the highest category in the world in terms of democratic standards
On the other hand, it is gradually increasing its prestige both in its region and on a global scale.
This is closely related to the AK Party's equal distance to all citizens, regardless of their ethnic, cultural, religious and political differences, and its view of all of them as "equal and free citizens" of our country.
As AK Party, we have made many amendments to the Constitution in 13 years in order to liquidate the tutelage, authoritarian and prohibitive understanding at the root of the 1982 Constitution.
We have made significant progress in the democratization process with these amendments, the most important of which were the ones implemented in 2004 and 2010 in terms of their results and scope.
Our Party, which continues to work relentlessly to erase the effects of military and bureaucratic tutelage in the Constitution, reiterated its call for a new constitution after the 2011 elections, with the awareness that the New Turkey cannot be built with a Constitution that is a product of the coup era.
The Constitutional Reconciliation Commission, which started its work with the participation of the other parties in the Parliament that accepted the AK Party's call, collected nearly 70,000 individual opinions and nearly 500 institutional opinions on the new constitution.
Then, after 25 months of work, they drafted a total of 172 articles and reached a consensus on 60 articles, more than 40 of which were in the field of fundamental rights and freedoms.
A healthy and legitimate constitutional order can only come to life in a society on the path to normalization and civilianization.
Previous attempts at constitution-making did not result in success because the necessary ground and conditions for a new constitution were not provided.
Recent efforts for a new constitution have not escaped this fate either.
Even the 60-article compromise package reached during the current legislative period could not be realized due to the resistance of opposition parties.
Even if the desired results were not fully achieved, all of this contributed to Turkey's constitution drafting experience.
Since we came to power in 2002, we have continued our determined struggle against all kinds of tutelage structures.
Immediately after 2002, we faced coup attempts in various forms.
Our nation and our governments representing the will of our nation did not give the opportunity to illegitimate structures that attempted to destroy this will and usurp its sovereignty, coup attempts such as the April 27 e-missile, the 2008 attempt to shut down our party, and the December 17-25, 2013 parallel state structuring.
We have successfully fought and continue to fight against these unconstitutional and undemocratic foci, which pose a threat to our national security, within constitutional limits and with the power we receive from our nation.
All these developments clearly demonstrate the need for a new constitution based on social participation, pluralism, decentralization and democratic checks and balances.
The Republic of Turkey must now leave behind this structure, which is not based on the democratic will of society and is incapable of meeting its needs and expectations for the future.
With the awareness of this fact, we, as the AK Party, identify the need for a new structural transformation and come before our beloved nation with the call to bring Turkey a new civil and democratic constitution based on a social contract and ask for authorization.
b. What We Will Do
The AK Party is determined to crown its second breakthrough period with the new constitution that our people have long been waiting for.
With the great transformations we have made, Turkey is on the threshold of a new social contract.
Convened on April 23rd, 1920 in Ankara, the First Parliament is an important reference in the history of democracy.
Turkey will move forward in the 21st century taking into account the positive experience of the past.
On the other hand, we are going through a very dynamic process on a regional and global scale.
We will not be prisoners of global change.
We will remain the subjects of history; we will shape change by being in change.
We will develop our legal, judicial and constitutional order in line with the expectations of our people and the processes of change we are going through.
The new constitution will carry the achievements of our Republic in human rights and democracy into the future and completely erase the traces of tutelage.
The new constitution will recognize human dignity, individual rights and freedoms and social legitimacy as the moral and democratic foundation of the system and will be designed to meet the expectations of the individual and society for the future.
The AK Party does not see the new constitution as a problem of a party, a group or a segment, but as a historical issue for Turkey.
The AK Party believes that the constitutional system should be transformed according to democratic procedures and the principles of individual and social participation.
We believe that the solution to our fundamental political and social problems lies in further democratization.
The new constitution will be built on freedom, equality and justice;
human dignity will be the fundamental moral reference of the new constitution.
The new constitution will be citizen and society-oriented and will aim to increase the happiness and welfare of our people with a civilian understanding.
With its new structure, our constitution will make it possible to formulate and effectively implement rational political programs in changing world and national conditions.
In the last 13 years, our government has improved the quality of our democracy and realized major reforms to make our country a more democratic country.
We are determined to continue our march towards democratization with rapid steps in this period.
The struggle for democracy that our governments are waging is an effort to make the nation sovereign and us, the elected, subservient.
Our basic principle is to repay the trust that our nation has placed on our shoulders with service to our nation.
The road to democracy is a never-ending marathon for us.
We are aware that there are always higher standards befitting our nation.
With this confidence, we will continue the democratic legacy we have built in the past 13 years by deepening it in the second breakthrough period ahead.
In this period, when the new Turkey will have more solid foundations, the word and the decision will once again belong to our great nation.
We will continue to attach importance to protecting the dignity of free and fair elections and institutionalizing representative democracy, which we see as a prerequisite for participatory democracy.
In the second breakthrough period, we will fight against all kinds of focal points that place themselves above the national will, while ensuring that social tendencies are reflected in politics through democratic processes.
We will ensure more active participation of civil society organizations in governance as a requirement of participatory democracy.
In the new constitution, we will effectively protect the work of political parties and regulate party closures in line with international standards.
Democracy and development go hand in hand.
Every step we take in the field of democracy will also breathe new life and momentum into our development.
In the light of our principles of human development and our ultimate goal of becoming a center of attraction worldwide, we will raise the standards of our democracy to a higher level.
During the first breakthrough period, our governments acted with an understanding that positioned democracy and development side by side and developed both simultaneously, and succeeded in giving Turkey the fastest period of economic development and democratic progress in the history of the Republic.
In the new period, we aim to institutionalize the gains made in our struggle for democracy and make our democracy robust, predictable and permanent.
In the second breakthrough period, we will ensure that the New Turkey is governed by a participatory, pluralist, libertarian, democratic and civilian constitution.
We see the 2004, 2007 and 2010 constitutional amendments led by our governments and the work of the Constitutional Reconciliation Commission in the Parliament as a strong basis for a new constitution.
In the new constitution of the new Turkey, fundamental rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law, freedom of thought and belief will be based on social legitimacy.
While our new constitution will be based on individual rights and freedoms, it will be built on Turkey's accumulated experience, and will be prepared with a democratic approach in line with international norms to which we are a party.
The new constitution will be based on a definition of citizenship that recognizes the cultural and social diversity of our nation and makes no reference to any ethnic or religious identity.
The new constitution will not contain value judgments and political preferences that would lead to the exclusion of any segment of society.
Our Constitution will be drafted in a manner that embraces the whole society, reflects our unity of destiny and is based on democratic checks and balances.
The new constitution will be based on shared values and an understanding of unity in diversity.
It will not regulate every area of social life and politics in detail, but will allow each area to develop its own dynamics.
The new constitution will contain the means and tools to solve problems.
Problems will be solved by individuals, society and the political institution in a democratic environment.
The AK Party is aware that a constitutional system is not established with the constitutional text alone.
Electoral laws, the law on political parties and other fundamental laws directly linked to the constitutional system will be renewed as a whole together with the text of the new constitution.
The electoral threshold will be reorganized to ensure a balance between justice in representation and stability in governance.
1.3. Governance Model and Presidential System
Turkey's commitment to participation and pluralism
and an effectively functioning model of government.
With the new constitution, we consider it essential for Turkey to have a government model that is based on participation and pluralism and that functions effectively.
As AK Party, we want a modern and effective government system that guarantees not only representation but also a government to emerge from the elections, that does not allow for instability, and that completely closes the way for the centers of tutelage to be implemented in our country.
The work on the new Constitution will also include the search for an effective and healthy governance model that will facilitate Turkey's achievement of its development goals for 2023 and beyond.
After the 1960 military coup, the current system, which was designed to institutionalize the bureaucracy's tutelage over politics, is far from meeting the minimum democratic requirements of a parliamentary system, even though it is presented as a parliamentary system.
This system has weakened the problem-solving capacity of politics, condemning Turkey to decades of coalition governments, forcing weak and unstable administrations and deepening many deep-rooted political and economic problems.
Contrary to the normative principles of the parliamentary system, the current system assigns the office of the President of the Republic the mission of overseeing the government on behalf of tutelary actors and deprives the relationship between the President and the Prime Minister of the legal and institutional foundations that would enable an effective and coordinated administration.
During the period of our governments, thanks to the democratic reforms implemented, the gains achieved in the fight against tutelage and the strong representation in the parliament, the weaknesses of the current system have been overcome periodically and a stable and effective administration has been achieved.
Following the 2007 constitutional crisis in the presidential elections, the constitutional amendments we pioneered ensured the direct election of the President by the people and the office of the President was freed from the tutelary mission.
However, the division of powers and duties within the political system between the President and the Prime Minister, who are directly elected by the people, necessitates a new arrangement.
Over the last eight years, thanks to the ethic of working together and the sense of service to the nation envisaged by the AK Party's political vision, the potential of the current system to generate crises has been kept under control by ensuring harmonious working between Presidents and Prime Ministers, and the political or economic crises of the past have not been allowed to occur.
However, the current system continues to carry the potential to generate crises if the President and the Prime Minister come from different political traditions.
As the AK Party, we believe that the presidential system will overcome the possible governance problems that may arise from this new situation created by the direct election of the President by the people, taking into account the tutelary fiction of the current system in our political history.
As a matter of fact, we have been advocating the presidential system for a long time, and we have submitted it as our party's proposal to the Constitutional Reconciliation Commission of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, which was established in 2011.
The opposition parties, on the other hand, preferred to discuss the issue in terms of individuals instead of making a positive contribution and conducting a principled and constructive debate to solve the potential problems that the direct election of the President by the people may cause in the functioning of the parliamentary system.
This attitude has had a negative impact on politics and public opinion in the pursuit of an effective and democratic political system.
Moreover, debates on the presidential system tend to overlook the fact that many democratic countries with strong economies are governed by this model.
In this framework, we have to continue the search for a system that fits our vision of a new Turkey and find a solution, without personalizing the debate, and by drawing on the experiences of our political tradition.
The ground on which government models will be discussed will undoubtedly be a democratic constitutional ground.
As the AK Party, we believe that there is no difference between the parliamentary system and the presidential system in terms of compatibility with democracy when structured from a democratic perspective.
As a matter of fact, both systems can have positive examples as well as negative ones.
However, we believe that the presidential system is a more appropriate model of governance due to the political instabilities caused by the parliamentary system, which has been detached from its democratic nature by being constructed in a tutelary manner, on the one hand, and the effective and dynamic governance required by our New Turkey vision, on the other.
In the new system, we will definitely not allow parallel structures that are not accountable to the legitimate political authority.
With the libertarian and human-oriented new Constitution that we will prepare with the kindness of our nation, elections will be able to produce stability,
where the legislature and the executive are independently effective,
democratic checks and balances are envisaged,
political representation of social diversity,
a decentralized administrative system is strengthened,
decision-making processes are accelerated,
We can move to a new political system where all kinds of tutelage are prevented.
In this framework, the presidential system we envision will finalize the democratic transformation Turkey has undergone under the AK Party's rule and will have a framework that will facilitate the achievement of its development goals for 2023 and beyond.
With these elements, we believe that the presidential system is better suited to Turkey's political experience and future vision.
1.4. Transformation in the Justice System
As AK Party, we see justice as the foundation of property and legitimacy and the basis of the rule of law.
For us, justice should be based on the rule of law, trusted by all, independent from all power centers, impartial and able to respond quickly to citizen demands.
The judiciary provides a guarantee of law,
It is our fundamental principle that it operates in accordance with international standards and democratic procedures.
We believe that the judicial power, which we see as a function required and produced by the social order, should be provided with a framework that inspires confidence, ensures predictability, does not dictate ideology, political imagination or belief, and is not influenced by these.
We do not see the judiciary only as an institution that ensures justice and guarantees the exercise of fundamental rights.
We believe that in the predictable environment provided by the law, uncertainty will decrease, production and investment decisions will be made in a healthier and more qualified manner, and thus our development process will accelerate.
a. What We Did
In the last 13 years, we have made fundamental improvements in the justice system and significantly reduced problems.
We abolished provisions in the Constitution that prevented citizens from seeking their rights, and we increased the ways for citizens to seek their rights.
We ended the trial of civilians in military courts.
We have made it a constitutional rule that the Military Court of Cassation and the Military High Administrative Court shall function in accordance with the requirements of the rule of law.
We removed from the Constitution provisions that prohibited the right to seek remedies before the courts against the dismissal decisions of the Supreme Military Council, the warning and reprimand penalties imposed on public officials, and the HSYK's dismissal decisions on judges and prosecutors.
We put an end to special trial procedures.
We abolished the State Security Courts, the Special Authorized Courts established under Article 250 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Special Authorized Courts established under Article 10 of the Anti-Terror Law.
We strengthened judicial independence and impartiality.
We restructured the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), which only consists of members from the Supreme Courts, on a broad-based basis.
For the first time, we enabled judges and prosecutors to elect members to the Council.
We have strengthened the judicial organization and introduced innovations for a more qualified justice service in a reasonable time.
We have increased the number of judges, prosecutors and personnel for fast and fair trials.
In 2002, we increased the number of judges and prosecutors from 9,349 to 14,782 as of September 2015.
Excluding those working in penal institutions, the number of our personnel increased from 26,274 in 2002 to 58,284 as of September 2015.
We have increased the number of first instance courts to ensure trial within a reasonable time.
In 2015, we increased the number of courts in the judicial judiciary from 3,581 in 2002 to 6,022, and the number of courts in the administrative judiciary from 146 to 206.
We initiated time management in the judiciary for trial in a reasonable time.
In order to provide more qualified services to our citizens, we increased the number of specialized personnel such as sociologists, psychologists, social workers and pedagogues working in the justice organization, especially in family and juvenile courts and penal execution institutions.
We strengthened training activities to improve the quality of judges, prosecutors and staff.
We established the Justice Academy of Turkey.
We strengthened the high courts and courts of first instance.

We strengthened the Supreme Courts in terms of prosecutors, examining judges and personnel.
We introduced arbitration and mediation to strengthen pre-judicial remedies.
We abolished the criminal courts of peace and replaced them with criminal judgeships of peace, which are exclusively responsible for dealing with matters directly related to personal liberty and security.
Thus, we have secured individual freedoms by introducing the "liberty judgeship" in some EU countries.
We have improved our institutional structure for the resolution of disputes arising from family law.
We gave importance to specialization for more qualified judicial services.
We have enabled increased specialization in criminal and civil courts and administrative courts.
We have developed new remedies for the judicial review of decisions taken by first instance courts.
With the National Judicial Network Project (UYAP), we have eliminated many of the reasons delaying the trial.
In the period when UYAP did not exist, it took months of correspondence and replies for our citizens to access information and documents such as population, land registry, trade registry records, etc., but with the UYAP application, our citizens can access this information and records in seconds.
While services in the courthouses were carried out with typewriters, within the scope of UYAP, we equipped the courthouses with computers since 2002 and provided laptops to all judges and prosecutors, enabling them to carry out their work electronically.
Our citizens are instantly informed about judicial proceedings against them through the SMS Information System.
With the Audio and Video Information System (SEGBÄ°S), we connected courts, prosecutor's offices and penal institutions with a separate video conferencing network.
Now, with the remote statement-taking method, the statements of our citizens can be taken from the penal institution or from a courthouse in another location.
With this practice, we have accelerated judicial services on the one hand and made life easier for our citizens on the other.
We renewed all the Basic Laws.
We carried out a comprehensive legislative reform.
We amended the Turkish Penal Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Obligations, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Turkish Commercial Code.
We removed the obstacles preventing those who cannot afford to benefit from justice services.
We ensured that anyone who does not have a lawyer in criminal investigations or trials will be assigned a lawyer upon request and will be exempt from legal costs.
For the first time, we introduced the practice of appointing lawyers for crime victims by the state.
We have made it easier for our citizens by changing the legislation on criminal records.
By introducing the practice of district governorships issuing criminal record certificates in addition to public prosecutor's offices, we prevented our citizens from waiting in line at the courthouse gates and facilitated the work of our citizens in places where there is no prosecutor's office.
Prisoners and convicts are entitled to compassionate leave in the event of serious illness or death of a relative.
We implemented a regulation that allows prisoners to have private family visits for certain periods of time.
We modernized the enforcement and bankruptcy offices and put an end to the victimization caused by enforcement and bankruptcy proceedings.
By prohibiting the seizure of items necessary for the debtor and family members living under the same roof, we have eliminated the grievances that have been experienced for years.
We prevented possible irregularities by ensuring that the payments to be made to the enforcement offices are made entirely through the bank.
We introduced a license requirement for trustee warehouses to ensure the healthy storage of our citizens' goods.
We have introduced the possibility of electronic bidding for auctions in order to prevent the sale of seized goods below their value and thus protect the rights of debtors and creditors.
We built modern justice palaces all over our country.
Until 2003, the total indoor area of justice services was 570 thousand square meters, while the total indoor area of the 212 justice palaces completed and put into service reached 3 million square meters.
We facilitated the work of our citizens in courthouses by establishing front offices and information desks in justice palaces with all kinds of technical equipment.
We have completed the modernization of the penal system.
We introduced "supervised release" for many convicts serving their sentences for simple crimes to serve their sentences outside.
We are closing prisons that do not meet international standards.
In this context, we closed 244 prisons in 13 years.
We increased the number of open penal institutions.
The ratio of detainees to prisoners, which is accepted as an important parameter of the criminal justice system worldwide, decreased from 54 percent in 2001 to 15 percent as of today.
In the European Union, this rate is more than 20 percent.
b. What We Will Do
In the period ahead, one of our main priorities will be to make fundamental reforms in our justice system to create a structure at advanced standards.
We see the judiciary not as a political power, but as a function required and produced by the social order.
We will restructure our judicial system according to this understanding and within the framework of a well-prepared strategy.
Recognizing that our country has suffered greatly from political and ideological judiciary, the AK Party sees the independence and impartiality of the judiciary as a means of securing the ability to respond to the demands for justice.
In this context, we will strengthen participation, democratic legitimacy and transparency as fundamental principles.
A well-functioning legal system is indispensable for a healthy democratic politics as well as for the promotion and enforcement of fundamental rights.
The rule of law is also a fundamental condition for quality and sustainable development.
Legal safeguards and predictability are vital for improving the business and investment climate.
As a democratic country, Turkey is committed to protecting the freedoms of its citizens through the rule of law,
to reassure the international community,
will continue to be a safe haven for domestic and foreign investors.
In order for legislation to have these qualities, we will ensure that it is developed through democratic procedures and that the "freedom-security balance" is respected.
We will take European standards into account for this.
We will remove the details that can be created by secondary regulations from the laws and put an end to the inflation of legislation.
We will effectively implement and realize the new Judicial Reform Strategy Document.

In this context, entrance requirements for law faculties will be designed to ensure adequate knowledge, and legal education will be reorganized in a way to ensure the harmony between theoretical knowledge and practice in terms of content, taking into account comparative examples.
We will organize vocational training in the field of justice in a way that will enable measurement and evaluation throughout the professional life.
We will further increase efforts to ensure that members of the judiciary closely follow international developments in their fields.
We will restructure the institution of expert witness.

We will also establish the Academy of Forensic Sciences to facilitate advanced research and training in this field.
We will activate international judicial cooperation activities and enhance judicial cooperation at regional and bilateral levels.
1.5. Security
Our understanding of politics puts human beings and human dignity at the center.
The guarantee of this dignity is the balance between freedom and security.
These are not mutually exclusive but complementary concepts.
We have reconsidered the state's approach to security, which was shaped by concerns and fears in the past, on the basis of citizen trust, and emphasized an approach that will strengthen the state-society-individual relationship.
As AK Party, we define security services as a basic public service needed to guarantee and fully exercise fundamental rights and freedoms in order to achieve the goal of an advanced democracy.
With the freedom-security balance that we take as the basis of our actions, we are realizing our principle of living freedoms in security and within the framework of the rule of law.
a. What We Did
With our AK Party governments, the understanding of security has changed.
In our actions, we have seen security as a means of securing freedoms and protecting the democratic will of the nation and public order.
From public order incidents to the fight against terrorism, we have endeavored to establish the security of our country at the highest level and to improve social peace and tranquility by implementing more effective and result-oriented security policies.
We redesigned the security service with a mindset that includes community support and adopted a people-oriented approach in the delivery of services.
We have revised our legislation according to this approach.
We restructured security institutions accordingly.
According to the results of the "Life Satisfaction Survey" conducted by TurkStat, public order services ranked first in the ranking of public services with the highest level of citizen satisfaction.
We established the Undersecretariat for Public Order and Security to coordinate policies and strategies in the fight against terrorism.
We enacted the Law on Prevention of Financing of Terrorism to combat terrorism and its financing.
As AK Party governments, we have fought and continue to fight against elements that threaten our national security and public order.
Recently, our democracy has faced attacks by parallel organizations within the state.
In this process, the law was instrumentalized and used for ideological purposes.
With the great support of our people, we did not allow these attempts, which can also be called the new tutelage structure.
We will never allow any activity aimed at disintegrating the state authority, no matter from whom it originates or with what intentions.
We will not leave the will, sovereignty and future of our nation to anyone.
AK Party cadres will continue to stand resolutely against those who want to stop this blessed march, whether under the name of parallel structure or other names.
Just as we fought against the old tutelage, we will continue our struggle against the new tutelage attempts with the common sense and support of our nation.
Considering their international connections, these elements are not only a threat to our government, but have turned into a national security problem that threatens the existence of the state and aims to collapse its structure.
No citizen should doubt that we will stand firm and resolute in the face of this threat.
Similar to the practices in developed democracies, we established the Security and Intelligence Commission for intelligence services, which are important for our national security, and opened them to parliamentary scrutiny.
We have improved the capabilities of our security units and met their needs at the maximum level.
We have completed Urban Security Management Systems in provincial centers and 225 district centers outside metropolitan municipalities.
We have provided 81 provinces and large districts, especially in tourism regions, with MOBESE systems that make a great contribution to crime prevention and enlightenment.
We have established modern criminal laboratories with the most advanced technological facilities in crime and incident investigation.
We launched the Emergency Call Centers Project, which aims to bring together multiple emergency call numbers under a single number (112), and have already put it into operation in 12 provinces.
We have given great importance and priority to preventive law enforcement services in order to prevent crimes before they are committed.
Thanks to the advanced technology and expertise developed, we have become one of the most successful countries in solving crimes and incidents.
In the past, Turkey was one of the countries accused of "unidentified perpetrators", but during our period in power, we have brought Turkey to a record that is praised, not criticized.
We have prepared an action plan to combat cybercrime and established a special unit within the General Directorate of Security.
By implementing the Community Supported Policing practice, we ensured that our police have closer relations with our citizens, increased trust in the police, and police-public cooperation.
We have formed special teams to combat public order crimes, which are among the leading crimes that disturb the peace of society and cause fear and anxiety.
We have made significant progress in the fight against terrorism, drugs, smuggling and organized crime.
We established the Department of Narcotics within the General Directorate of Security in order to fight drugs more effectively.
We established NARKOTIMs especially around schools.
We focused on trainings that will ensure the specialization of security officers.
We implemented projects to increase the administrative and technical capacity of our border security units.
With the policies we have implemented and the actions we have taken, we have made Turkey one of the countries with the lowest crime rate in Europe in terms of security and public order.
Today, our country is among the leading countries in Europe in terms of crime clearance rates.
b. What We Will Do
As the AK Party, we will continue to decisively and without compromise to crack down on all structures that may disrupt the security and public order environment and create pressure and threats for our citizens to exercise their constitutional right to freedoms.
We will fight with determination against the environment and focal points that support international and regional terrorism, as we have done so far.
We will maintain our principled stance against terrorism in our geography, no matter where it originates and from whom it comes.
This stance and struggle will be based on the rule of law;
will further support security services with mechanisms to increase transparency, participation and accountability,
We will further strengthen the trust of our citizens in the security services.
In this context, we will continue to implement policies that embrace all segments of society and facilitate access to security services, especially for women, children, disabled and elderly citizens.
In the coming period, the national fight against terrorism, organized crime, cybercrime, narcotic crimes and smuggling
and strengthen cooperation between international organizations,
We will continue our determined fight against these crimes as we have done until today.
We will increase security measures to combat drugs and continue to crack down on criminal organizations in this field with determination.
In this context, we will strengthen our personnel and technical capacity in combating the illicit production, trade and use of narcotics.
We will improve coordination among organizations active in the fight against drugs and increase cooperation with neighboring countries and in the international arena.
We will prioritize preventive and protective security services and move towards risk management.
In the coming period, the relationship between citizens and law enforcement will be based on trust. We will strengthen the community supported law enforcement approach.
We will review the functions of law enforcement agencies and restructure them with a civilian approach.
In this context, we will strengthen the connection of the Gendarmerie Organization with the Ministry of Interior and ensure that law enforcement services are carried out with a holistic understanding.
With the awareness that security is a public service, we will create the necessary environment for our security personnel to treat our citizens well and we will emphasize in-service training for this purpose.
We will establish a new, professional border police organization responsible for the protection of our borders.
We are determined to take all measures to improve the quality and quantity of our personnel in the field of security services and to ensure their professionalization.
We will restructure the institutions that train personnel for the police force and reorganize the training method.

Missing Alert on finding a missing child,
International Police Training Center (UPEM),
Demining of Turkey's Eastern Borders
and Construction of Removal Centers projects.
We will expand Emergency Call Centers across the country.
1.6. Governance
As AK Party, we have always opposed a sharp distinction between the rulers and the ruled.
Instead, we have endeavored to define problems together and seek solutions together.
Instead of imposing rules on our people, we have taken steps to make life easier on the way to serving the people.
We acted on the principle of producing more services at less cost.
We tried to meet the needs and demands of our people without wasting our resources.
We have adopted a service approach that looks at the problems from the people and produces solutions, based on the demands of the people with the authority and power it receives from the people.
With this understanding, we see public services as the main mission of public administration to facilitate the lives of our citizens and provide them with easy access to basic public services.
As AK Party governments, which have adopted a people-oriented management style, we know that we owe it to our citizens to continue our understanding of service race and to provide better quality services to our citizens by continuing to raise the bar continuously.
With this understanding, we continuously improve our public administration and public employees with modern methods and increase their effectiveness through innovative practices.
As AK Party, we see public administration as an area that requires continuous improvement.
We adopt an innovative approach based on human dignity in the face of changing conditions and understandings.
We are reviewing our management approach, structure and practices in a participatory approach against bureaucratic inertia and routinization.
We are committed to continuously improving our quality of work and life with political ownership under the watchful eye of our citizens.
Public administration is critical to the overall quality of our country.
A well-functioning, transparent and accountable public administration also facilitates the development of the economy and civil society in an enabling environment.
The period ahead will be one in which quality will be at the forefront in the field of governance, as it is in every field.
The restructuring of public administration in terms of mindset, strategy and organization will also support the establishment and development of quality standards in key areas.
a. What We Did
In our 13 years in power, we have implemented democratic governance practices based on the principle that "the state exists to serve the nation".
We ensured that strategic plans, performance programs and annual reports, the three main elements of strategic management, are disseminated across public institutions and shared with the public.

In this context, we implemented the Laws on Municipalities, Metropolitan Municipalities, Special Provincial Administration and Local Administration Unions.
We strengthened local governments.
We changed the rates and distribution principles of the shares to be allocated to local governments.
In addition to the population criterion, we have developed new criteria for special administrations, such as the area of the provinces, the number of villages and the population of rural areas, as well as the development index, making it possible to allocate more resources to regions with high service areas and high needs.
We reduced the number of municipalities by terminating the legal personality of first-tier municipalities within metropolitan municipalities.

Transparency is as necessary for efficiency as it is for justice.
Transparency also has an important function in preventing the use of public resources, facilities and practices for personal benefit and preventing unfair competition.
Transparency is a key determinant of improving quality in governance.
As AK Party, our basic motto is that all the work we carry out on behalf of our citizens, whom we see as the true and sole owners of the state, should be carried out in a transparent, participatory and accountable manner.
With this motto, we know that the basis of a successful and transparent administration based on the needs and demands of our citizens is justice-based.
This is the basis of our determination to fight corruption in our public administration policies and practices.
We see it as part of our understanding of the democratic rule of law to keep our people informed and accountable to them at the highest political and bureaucratic level when necessary.

Systematic measurement and sharing of implementation and post-implementation impacts, as well as during the preparation phase, will be emphasized more in the coming period as a requirement of transparency.
In the second breakthrough period, we will strengthen our participatory democracy with a more transparent and accountable governance approach, and we will continue our fight against all forms of corruption with determination.

Policies and practices directly targeting people and society have been among the main priorities of the AK Party governments.
Our party has adopted the principle of let the people live so that the state can live.
The concept of the social state has been strongly implemented in all areas of life.
Social policies are not only valuable in themselves, but are also taken as a fundamental touchstone for all other policy areas.
This approach has been a concrete reflection of our human-centered approach.
As the Justice and Development Party, we see human beings as the very purpose of development and we know that qualified, healthy and well-equipped people are the greatest tool in achieving this goal.
We believe that we will achieve the goals we desire in the fields of science and technology, which we see as a prerequisite for making a breakthrough in the economy, with our well-trained and well-equipped people.
We are aware that improvements in our social and human capital trigger economic development, increase democratization and raise our country's visibility in the world.
With this approach, improving the quality of education,
delivering effective health care,
preserving and developing the dynamism of the population and the family structure,
women, youth, children
and we will continue to be a government that gives its employees the place, importance and support they deserve.
While we see our children as potential youth and our youth as the guarantee of our future, we will continue our human-centered development approach by providing them with the physical, cultural and artistic environment they deserve in a better quality.
With this understanding, we aim for Turkey to move from the "high human development" category to the "very high human development" category.

We consider education processes as an important opportunity to improve the quality of the knowledge and skills of our people, as well as to shape their manners and behaviors in a positive way, to increase their culture and to be a useful member of society.
We adopt an approach based on the interaction between knowledge and consciousness.
With this approach, we are committed to the development of a knowledge-based economy that trains the manpower needed by the knowledge-based economy,
Our main priority continues to be the creation of a liberal, productive and competitive education system, the training of teachers suitable for this system, the development of curricula and the establishment of appropriate environments.
a. What We Did
As AK Party, we consider education as the main tool for development and we have spared no sacrifice in this area.
On the one hand, we made significant investments in the infrastructure of education, and on the other hand, we realized radical reforms and regulations regarding our education system.
We restructured the central organization of the Ministry of National Education by envisaging a more flexible and dynamic structure to meet the requirements of today's world and the needs of our economic and social life.

We introduced free dress code for all students.
We liberalized the headscarf for academic staff, teachers and higher and secondary education students.

By increasing the number of elective courses, we gave our students the opportunity to choose according to their interests and abilities.
We made it possible to teach different languages and dialects as elective courses in primary and secondary education, and opened graduate programs in higher education.
We included the Life of the Prophet Muhammad, the Holy Quran and Basic Religious Knowledge as optional elective courses in the curriculum.
In addition to the steps we have taken towards freedoms in our education system, we have also made significant improvements in terms of physical infrastructure.
The average duration of education for adults increased from 5.5 years in the early 2000s to 7.6 years in 2013.
The expected schooling rate for the new generation has increased to 14.4 years.
Thus, we will double the current schooling rate in the new generation.

We see the raising of healthy generations as a necessity for the formation of human capital for development.
Our main goal is to ensure the sustainability of the service standard in the field of health, to increase the quality of service with new reforms, and to bring service to the doorsteps of our citizens, especially the poor.
To this end, we aim to continuously improve the quality of our human resources and services in the field of health.
On the one hand, we will improve primary health care services, and on the other hand, we will give more importance to preventive health services.

At this point, we have expanded home care services all over the country.
The progress we have made in maternal and child health and vaccination services has also been reflected in infant and maternal mortality rates, and the decline in maternal and infant mortality rates in the last decade has been exemplary worldwide.
In 2015, we allocated 81 billion TL for total public health expenditures, including those of the Social Security Institution.
Thus, we doubled the resources we allocated for health expenditures compared to 2002.
In 2014, we increased prenatal care services from 70 percent in 2002 to 97 percent, the rate of hospital births from 69 percent to 98 percent and the vaccination rate from 77 percent to 97 percent.
As a result of these developments, the infant mortality rate (per thousand live births), which was 31.5 in 2002, was reduced to 7.8 in 2014, the under-five mortality rate (per thousand live births), which was 40, to 10.3, and the maternal mortality rate (per hundred thousand live births), which was 64, to 15.9.

2.3. Family, Children and Dynamic Population
As AK Party, we aim to strengthen the family institution,
to increase the number of our children and ensure that they grow up in a qualified manner
as the main axis of our people-centered development policies.
We see our strong family structure as an important difference and advantage over other societies.
We owe our social solidarity and our survival against all odds to our strong family structure.
We consider our families as carriers of the values that make us who we are and as important bridges that connect the individual to society and society to the individual.
In modern societies, the moral support, human and social capital infrastructure provided by the family is eroding.
As AK Party, we have seen these threats since the day we were founded and we have considered the protection and strengthening of the family as a priority issue for the survival of our nation.
As AK Party, we know that the basis of a strong society, which is our ideal for the future, is a strong and happy family.
We see the family as the first and most important educational institution that ensures the healthy transfer of principles and values between generations.
In our view, our children, the guarantee of our future, will grow up in a quality family environment, grow up mentally and physically healthy, and become generations that bring dynamism to society.
a. What We Did
From the first day we came to power, we said that family is the building block of society.
We have emphasized that this is where we differ significantly from other developed societies and we have developed policies to ensure that we have a strong family structure.
In 2011, we established the Ministry of Family and Social Policies.
We made the necessary arrangements to increase the effectiveness of special counseling services for families.
Within this framework, we continue to provide the necessary guidance and consultancy services for the opening and functioning of family counseling centers opened outside the Ministry.

We developed new programs with a holistic perspective, focusing on the family in our social support.
In this context, we launched the Family Social Support Program (ASDEP).
With this program, we aimed to ensure that services are accessible to all groups in need, that individuals in need of social services first become self-sufficient in the environment they live in, and that families in need of social services and assistance are provided with on-site, effective and widespread services.
We conducted pilot studies in KÄ±rÄ±kkale and KarabÃ¼k provinces.
We extended leave rights for adoption, death of a working mother and premature births.
We regulated paternity leave for workers whose spouse gives birth.
We have developed support models to encourage marriage among young people.
In order to expand day care centers, we granted these institutions tax exemptions for 5 years, allowing them to benefit from the tax incentives granted to pre-school education institutions.
We give special priority to our children in our family-oriented policies.
Based on the rights and needs of our children, we aimed to increase their opportunities and possibilities to develop their potential and facilitate their access to basic public services.
During our 13 years in power, we have accomplished important works for our children.
We expanded early childhood education and increased schooling rates.
We have implemented conditional education and health aids, free books, school milk and transported education.
We provided regular cash support to mothers for an average of 3 million children annually.
As of October 2015, the number of people who stayed in orphanages and were employed in public institutions and organizations within the scope of Law No. 2828 exceeded 40 thousand.
In 2015, we appointed 1,876 people.

We set up special courts for our children.
By establishing child support centers, we secured children who are victims of crime, dragged into crime and at risk on the streets.
We run social support programs for children in need of special attention.
Our first priority has been the care of our children with their families instead of their care in homes and dormitories.
We support children who live with their families but need support without disrupting the integrity of the family.
While 12 thousand people received social and economic support in 2002, this number reached approximately 63 thousand people as of May 2015.
In 2015, the average monthly amount of social and economic support provided was 582 TL.

We established Child Support Centers for children between the ages of 11-18 who are victims of crime, dragged into crime, and at risk on the streets.
These centers serve to meet the basic needs of these children and ensure that they return to their families and close environments.
We implemented the ANKA Psychosocial Support Program for the treatment of risks and traumas experienced by children.
Population and its characteristics play an important role in the AK Party's people-oriented policies.
We recognize and embrace that development and prosperity can only be possible with a young, dynamic and high quality population structure.
We believe that we should grow rich without growing old.
We have taken measures to delay population ageing and slow down the fertility rate as late as possible.
Since 2006, the total fertility rate has stagnated at the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.
According to long-term population projections by TurkStat, if no measures are taken, the fertility rate is projected to decline to 1.65 children by 2050.
In this context, we changed our population policy and shifted from the fertility-reducing policies implemented until the 2000s to fertility-increasing policies.
In this framework, we introduced the possibility for working women to borrow for births up to the third child, facilitated access to in vitro fertilization and provided 5th region incentives for nurseries and day care centers to be established by the private sector.

We aim for a Turkey where children's rights are adopted as a national strategy and implemented by all public institutions and organizations.
In the coming period, we will minimize the scope of institutional care by placing children under protection and care with their families, if appropriate, if this is not possible, with a relative family, and if this is not possible, with a foster family.
With the structural transformation in child services, we will ensure the transition from institutional care to family care, from ward system to home environment.
Within the scope of service transformation, existing dormitories and day-care centers will be closed down and child care services will be provided only through home-based institutions.

2.4. Social Protection and Fight against Poverty
As AK Party, we come from an understanding that sees human beings as the most honorable of all creatures.
Every single person is valuable to us and we are responsible for every single person.
With this awareness, we put people at the center of all our policies.
We determine our economic and social policies within the framework of our human development approach that prioritizes social justice.
We see eradicating poverty, providing social support to everyone in need and reducing the need for social support as among our main tasks.
Sustaining our achievements in the fight against poverty and further improving income distribution are among our main goals.
Under our governments, Turkey has become one of the rare countries that has been able to grow its economy while simultaneously improving social balances.
While income distribution deteriorated in many countries amid the global crisis, Turkey continued to generate employment and strengthen social policies.
As a result of our policies, according to World Bank data, the share of the middle class in Turkey doubled between 2002 and 2011.
Turkey was the only OECD country to improve income distribution in this period.
In the Human Development Index ranking announced by UNDP, Turkey ranked 80th among 158 countries in 2000 and 69th among 187 countries in 2014.
With this ranking, Turkey is in the "high human development" category.
In the coming period, we aim to be in the "very high human development" group.
a. What We Did
As the Justice and Development Party, we have reached out to all citizens in need of social protection since the first day we came to power and we will continue to do so.
When we came to power, the first thing we did was to eliminate the disorganization in the field of social services and assistance and unify the organizations and policies in this field under the roof of a single ministry.
We reduced poverty.
There are no people in Turkey whose per capita expenditure is below $1 and $2.15 per day.
The population with per capita expenditures below USD 4.3 per day decreased from 30.3 percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2013.
During our government, we did not crush our public employees and pensioners against inflation, on the contrary, we increased their incomes in real terms.
From the end of 2002 to the end of January 2015, while inflation increased by 185 percent, the lowest civil servant salary, including family allowance, increased by 435 percent to 2,097 TL and increased by 88 percent in real terms.

As of 2014, we provided approximately 301 thousand women with regular cash support of 250 TL per month, totaling 814 million TL.
Between June 2003 and June 2015, we provided TL 4 billion in conditional education aids to 2 million students on condition that they attend school.
Within the scope of Conditional Health Assistance, we transferred 1.4 billion TL to the families of 1 million children on condition that they have regular health checks.
We are about to complete the "Integrated Social Assistance Services Project" to establish an institutionalized social assistance system by eliminating the lack of a well-functioning common database in the field of social assistance.

In the field of social services, while home care is a priority, we have ensured the transition from the ward-type care model to the home-type care model in institutional care.
We increased the pensions paid to the disabled by 200 percent to 300 percent, depending on their disability, and ensured that disabled people under the age of 18 can also benefit.
We launched the home care pension for disabled people in need and we also started to make monthly payments of two net minimum wages for disabled people who benefit from private care centers.
In order to remove barriers to the participation of persons with disabilities in social life, we made arrangements to make public areas, buildings and public transportation services accessible.
We signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007.
In 2009, it was approved by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and entered into force.
We introduced the practice of holding a separate and centralized exam for disabled people who will be appointed as civil servants for the first time.
As of 2002, the number of disabled people working as civil servants in the disabled quota was 5,777, while this figure reached 37,031 as of May 2015.
In 2007, the number of disabled people benefiting from home care services was 30,368, while as of September 2015, we provide home care services to 466,427 disabled people.
We provided two employment rights for the relatives of the deceased members of the Turkish Armed Forces and security officers within the scope of duty and war disability, and one employment right for those who are disabled.
We have provided an employment right to the relatives of those who lost their lives and to those who are disabled among other public officials within the scope of duty disability.
We have introduced a right to employment for civilian victims of terrorism who lost their lives or became disabled due to terrorist acts.
We provided employment opportunities for many people.
b. What We Will Do

We will increase coordination and cooperation among social service and assistance organizations merged under the Ministry of Family and Social Policies.
In this context, we will establish the Family Information System.
We will maintain our approach that favors the poorest in social transfers and tax regulations.

2.5. Women
The rights and welfare of women and the elimination of the obstacles they face in social life are indispensable for our goal of a strong society and our development.
Our women are the pillars of our families as well as social life.
As AK Party, we want women to become more empowered individually and socially,
to have better quality education opportunities,
Increasing their effectiveness in decision-making mechanisms,
Increasing their employment by facilitating their entry into the labor market,
ensuring their social security
and increasing the number of women entrepreneurs are our main goals.
a. What We Did
As in the rest of the world, many regulations that turn the disadvantaged position of women from the past into an advantage in our country were realized for the first time during the AK Party governments.
Our women have shown how productive they are in society, business life and civil society activities with these arrangements we have made.
The high increase in the labor force participation rate of women in recent years is one of the most important indicators of this.
As AK Party, we have given our women the value they deserve and strengthened their role in the development process of our country.
We realized many reforms for women during this period.
First of all, we constitutionally guaranteed positive discrimination for women.
We have strengthened the principle of equal opportunities for women and men through amendments to Article 10 of the Constitution.
Our women are now more strongly represented in parliament.
The number of women in parliament increased from 24 in 2002 to 98 in the 2015 elections.
We pioneered the establishment of the Commission for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men within the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
We have been running this Commission effectively.
We made it possible for women who were discriminated against because of their religious beliefs, whose freedom of education was restricted and discriminated against because of their headscarf, to exercise their right to education and work.
We observed the principle of zero tolerance in the fight against violence against women.
We made legal arrangements to prevent domestic violence, honor killings and honor killings.
Again for this purpose, we became the first country to sign the "Council of Europe Convention (Istanbul Convention)" without reservations.
In line with our basic understanding that no woman should be left defenseless and unclaimed, we provide protection and shelter services to women and their children who apply to state institutions.
We updated the "National Action Plan on Combating Domestic Violence against Women" with the participation of relevant parties.

We also achieved a significant increase in the number of women's guesthouses to 133.
During our AK Party governments, there have been significant improvements in basic indicators regarding women.
We have realized significant increases in schooling rates in primary, secondary and higher education in the last decade.
In this context, we have increased the enrollment rates of especially female students and ensured convergence with the enrollment rates of male students.
While the net enrollment rate in primary education was 90.2 percent in 2003-2004, it was 93.4 percent and 86.9 percent for boys and girls, respectively. In 2014-2015, the net enrollment rate was 96 percent and 96.6 percent for boys and girls, respectively.
Net enrollment rates in secondary education have also increased significantly in recent years, reaching 94.4 percent in total and 94.4 percent and 94.3 percent for boys and girls, respectively.
The net enrollment rate in higher education, which was 14.7 percent in the 2002-2003 academic year, increased to 39.5 percent in the 2014-2015 academic year.
For women, this rate increased from 13.5 percent in the 2002-2003 education period to 41.1 percent in the 2014-2015 education period.
We launched Conditional Education Assistance to increase the schooling rates of our children.
We have continuously increased these aids, and we have also increased the amount of aid given to girls.
We make payments only to mothers.
Through campaigns such as "Haydi KÄ±zlar Okula", "Baba Beni Okula Send Me to School", "Kardelenler" and projects such as "Support to Basic Education Project" and "Increasing Schooling of Girls Project", which we carry out in cooperation with the private sector and non-governmental organizations, we aim to reduce the dropout rates of female students.
We organize education programs for women and girls who leave school early.
We strengthened the position of women in society by making important arrangements in employment opportunities, social security rights, entrepreneurship support and maternity leave.
As AK Party, we supported the employment of our women.
In order to encourage the employment of women, we covered the employer's share of insurance premiums at certain rates.
While the labor force participation rate of women was 27.9 percent in 2002, we increased this rate to 33.6 percent in 2014 thanks to the policies we have pursued in the field of women's employment and the projects we have implemented in recent years.
As a result of the policies we pursued in the 2010-2014 period, we provided new job opportunities for approximately 1.5 million women.

We aim to create a sustainable and efficient social security system while covering all our citizens under social security and general health insurance.
In developing our social security system, we are committed to ensuring fairness among employees, employers and pensioners.
and creating a sustainable balance is our fundamental principle.

While the working age population has increased by 18 percent in the last 13 years, the number of active insured persons has increased by 66 percent as an indicator of the expansion of social security coverage.

As AK Party, for sustainable economic development, we have taken advanced democratic standards and a fair judicial system that operates on the basis of universal legal norms as a basis.
Especially the judicial reform,
participatory democracy
and the progress we are making in governance,
It also plays a critical role in consolidating our economic transformation process, which has reached an important stage.
As in every field, we are entering a new era in the economy.
In this period, we will focus on microeconomic and sectoral transformations while strengthening our macroeconomic stability and achievements.

3.1. Growth and Macroeconomic Stability
Our long-term development goal is to raise the international position of our country through structural transformations based on the fundamental values and expectations of our nation in a reshaping world
and to increase the welfare of our people.
We see increasing the happiness and welfare of our people as the main goal in the economic policies we will implement.
The economy is an area that the AK Party government has always attached great importance to in line with confidence and stability and the welfare and strength of our nation.
Further improvement of the investment environment through an open and integrated economic structure is an indispensable principle of our economic development approach based on a free market economy.
In our first breakthrough period, with this principle and the policies we implemented, we made our country an attractive environment for both domestic and international investors, and we achieved significant increases in international capital inflows.
In the second breakthrough period, we will ensure economic growth without compromising this understanding.
a. What We Did
It is not possible to ensure macroeconomic stability in the absence of political stability.
The political stability we have achieved in the last 13 years and the environment of confidence based on this stability have provided a strong foundation for the realization of important structural reforms.
As a result of the environment of confidence and stability we have built, the main macroeconomic instability factors such as inflation and public deficits, which had been hindering our development, have largely ceased to be a problem in the recent period.
Thus, we have made it possible to focus on areas that will accelerate the development process.
We have achieved high growth rates
and a period in which we came to the forefront as a rising economy in the world.
On the one hand, we reduced the fragility of the economy through structural reforms and strong regulations,
On the other hand, we ensured the free functioning of markets in a competitive environment.
In order to maintain the environment of stable growth and confidence we have achieved, we have ensured equality of opportunity and justice in the economy, and we have not granted privileges or privileges to anyone.
We did not create a protected area of easy money-making for anyone by managing competition well, and we made a rule-based market economy approach dominant.
We built our economic policies on the principles of trust, stability, harmony, transparency, consistency and predictability.
We shared our policies and results with the public in a transparent manner,
we have taken care to ensure that all applications are consistent with each other.
By ensuring continuity in fundamental policies, we created a predictable environment for our people and economic decision makers.
We made an accountable understanding dominant in state administration.
We have acted with the awareness that the authority given to us by the people is a time-limited trust.
Thanks to our economic policies based on these principles, we have become an exemplary country in the world.
Our strong economic structure was instrumental in our rapid recovery from the global economic crisis.
The success of our country, which stands out in the world, is not based on macroeconomic aggregates alone, but is the result of the economic and political stability we have achieved, backed by the necessary socio-economic reforms.
In the environment of stability we have achieved, the risks arising from the public sector have disappeared,
macroeconomic uncertainties have diminished,
our enterprises' access to finance has become easier
and investments have increased significantly.
This has boosted production and employment on the one hand and the competitiveness of our private sector, which is the main driver of our growth, on the other.
Turkey has experienced a significant transformation process in many political, economic and social fields during our governments.
We have increased our Gross Domestic Product from USD 230 billion in 2002 to approximately USD 800.1 billion in 2014.
We tripled our national income per capita from USD 3,500 to USD 10,390.
In 2002, according to purchasing power parity, Turkey's per capita income was 36 percent of the EU average and in 2013 it reached 53 percent of the EU average.
As a result of our successful implementation of macroeconomic stability measures, we have brought inflation down to single digits and made significant progress in achieving price stability.
In this context, inflation declined from 29.7 percent in 2002 to 6.2 percent in 2012. In 2014, despite cyclical adversities, it was realized at 8.2 percent in single digits.
In the 2002-2014 period, we strengthened public finance and the banking sector.
In this context, we reduced Treasury borrowing rates from 63.8 percent to around 7 percent.
Thus, we reduced the economy's vulnerability to external shocks. In 2014, interest rates were realized at 9.8 percent.
We made a significant improvement in this area by reducing the budget deficit from 12 percent in 2002 to 1.3 percent in 2014.
In the same period, we reduced the total public debt stock from 74 percent to 33.5 percent.
The benefits of the reforms and political stability that we decisively implemented during the economic transformation process were more evident during the recent global economic crisis.
In addition to the macroeconomic policies that we have implemented correctly and in a timely manner, thanks to the fiscal space we have created, the Turkish economy has positively differentiated itself from many countries in the global crisis thanks to our sound financial system.
As a result, Turkey was one of the countries that recovered from the global economic crisis the fastest and was least affected by global economic uncertainties.
In the 2002-2014 period, our average growth rate was around 5 percent.
While the average income of the richest 10 percent was 18.3 times that of the poorest 10 percent in 2002, this ratio dropped to 11.6 times in 2014.
Thus, we have gradually achieved a fairer distribution of income.
Resources that were largely allocated to interest expenditures were shifted to social policies, investments and personnel expenditures in an environment of confidence and stability.
We increased the ratio of social expenditures, which includes education, health and social protection expenditures, to GDP from 13.7 percent in 2002 to 18.4 percent in 2014.
As a requirement of our social state approach, we increased the share of social expenditures in general government expenditures from 33 percent to 46 percent in the same period.
b. What We Will Do
As AK Party, we will continue to integrate our economic policies with strong social policies, knowing that in today's competitive world, investments in people, their qualities and a healthy social environment are also investments in our economic potential.
In the period ahead, increasing the share of the manufacturing industry in GDP, with a view to boosting domestic production and reducing import dependency, is important for structural transformation.
The AK Party is aware of the need to accelerate productivity growth and industrialization to create this structure.
With more emphasis on R&D, led by the private sector,
We are determined to realize this with an export-oriented and competitive production structure.
Our country, which has made a significant development move in the last 13 years, will accelerate the process of convergence with developed countries.
Maintaining strong macroeconomic and financial stability in the period ahead is indispensable for the success of our economic policies.
Our 2023 vision, which sets out the horizon for the 100th year of our Republic, and the plans and transformation programs we have prepared with a participatory approach will be our road map.
Our main strategy for high and stable growth is private sector-led,
open to the outside
and the development of our competitive production structure.
Productivity increase
and strengthening the industrialization process are the cornerstones of this strategy.
Increasing domestic savings and channeling them to more productive areas,
increasing the share of manufacturing industry in GDP by increasing private sector investments
and improving our labor productivity
we will maintain stable growth.
In this context, our growth strategy is based on 5 fundamental axes.
These axes will be important policy areas in the period ahead for the realization of our growth strategy.
Strengthening macroeconomic stability,
Developing human capital and activating the labor market,
Increasing technology and innovation development capacity,
Strengthening the physical infrastructure,
Improving institutional quality.
As part of strengthening and maintaining the stability we have recently achieved, we will work to improve the quality of public revenues and expenditures.
We will be careful not to increase the share of public expenditures in total GDP, thereby minimizing the exclusionary effect of the public sector on the private sector.
We will enable the implementation of new policies with the fiscal space to be created through revenue-raising efforts such as tax incentives.
We will maintain a monetary policy framework that will strengthen price stability.
We will implement policies and measures for the permanent solution of the current account deficit.
In parallel, we will continue our efforts to increase domestic savings.
Turkey has a young and dynamic population structure to support its rapid development process.
In the period ahead, we will increase labor force participation in order to maximize the opportunity offered by population dynamics,
We will ensure that the quality structure of education in particular is improved.
In line with the needs of the labor market, in addition to education policies aimed at developing human capital, we will ensure the attraction of qualified manpower to our country by providing a suitable working environment, provide important input to the areas of technology development capability and institutional quality, and thus contribute to growth.
In the period ahead, we will continue to work on
We will increase R&D and innovation activities with a focus on the private sector.
We will increase added value by accelerating the commercialization and branding processes of the outputs to be obtained.
We will plan our public infrastructure investments in a way that supports the healthy development of production in the economy, but without wasting resources.
High-quality infrastructure investments by the public sector will motivate private sector investments and increase production capacity;
on the one hand, and productivity-based growth dynamics on the other.
We will contribute to stable and high growth by improving corporate quality at company and country level.
We will focus on improving the governance processes of our companies, extending their lifespan and solving efficiency and scale problems.
In the same context, we will continue the fight against informality and corruption.
It will pursue predictability and stability in tax regulations;
protect intellectual property and patent rights,
ensure the efficient functioning of markets
and strengthen the investment climate.
We will enable decision-making processes in our country to function in a healthier way and increase production capacity more rapidly by making investment and production more attractive.
Increasing new inflows of international direct investment, especially in productive areas, to boost productivity through technology transfer
and by achieving direct job-creating results,
we aim to contribute to growth.
3.2. Balance of Payments
As AK Party, we have focused on increasing the quality of our production and exports in achieving structural transformation in the economy.
With this approach, we will continue our policies to address the structural problems underlying the high current account deficit that Turkey experienced during periods of rapid growth in the first breakthrough period in the second breakthrough period.
The essence of the new Turkey's economic policies will be to continue to reduce the current account deficit by focusing on its domestic and external causes, while realizing growth with a better balance of payments balance sheet.
With programs to support domestic production, we aim to improve the balance of foreign trade and transform our increasing resources into more income by directing them to productive areas.
a. What We Did
During our AK Party governments, the ratio of exports to GDP realized at an annual average of 17 percent between 2002 and 2014.
According to 2002-2014 realizations, the annual average export growth was 14.2 percent in nominal terms and 8.8 percent in real terms.
Despite the global crisis in this period, our exports maintained their upward trend.
Export prices fluctuated during this period and increased by an annual average of 4.6 percent.
With our strategy of diversifying our export markets, we increased the share of non-EU markets in our total exports from 43.3 percent to 56.5 percent in the 2002-2014 period.
The ratio of imports to GDP realized at an annual average of 26.5 percent in the 2002-2014 period.
In the same period, annual average import growth was 16.3 percent in nominal terms and 9.4 percent in real terms.
In line with economic growth and stability, we ensured that the share of short-term debt and the private sector in the external debt stock increased while that of the public sector decreased.
By the end of 2014, the Central Bank's net reserves, which we inherited as USD 28.1 billion in 2002, reached USD 127.3 billion.
In 2012, we introduced an investment incentive program with sectoral and regional dimensions to boost domestic production.
In 2013, in order to increase domestic savings rates and keep the current account deficit under control, we took decisions to limit consumer loans and support export and SME loans.
b. What We Will Do
As AK Party, we aim to reach 500 billion dollars in goods exports and 150 billion dollars in services exports in 2023 with new investments and transformations in our manufacturing industry.
Our main target for merchandise exports is a 1.5 percent share of world exports.
In addition to this positive performance in exports, we are also carefully monitoring the current account deficit and taking the necessary structural and cyclical measures.
We aim to reduce the ratio of foreign trade deficit to GDP with our "Priority Transformation Program for Reducing Dependence on Imports", which aims to ensure the transformation of production in favor of high value-added products and to reduce import dependency and thus the current account deficit by encouraging the production and use of domestic inputs.
We also aim to raise the ratio of exports to imports to 70 percent and to increase the share of medium and high technology products in exports to about 40 percent by improving the quality of exports.
Within the scope of the program, we will update the Input Supply Strategy (GSTS) by taking into account Turkey's inventory of input supply needs.
We will prepare a Turkish Industrial Strategy and Sectoral Strategies, prioritizing R&D, innovation and design activities for medium-high and high-tech products.
We will create new investment support programs for medium and high technology products.
We will start implementing investment support programs to focus companies on the production of medium-high and high-tech products.
We will effectively implement a new incentive system that includes large-scale investments and strategic sectors based on reducing import dependency.
In order to increase the localization rate, we will support clustering activities that will ensure cooperation between enterprises in the supply chain and increase added value.
We will make the necessary arrangements to increase Turkey's exports of goods and services to non-EU countries without reducing its share in traditional export markets.
Export supports will be based on effectiveness, and we will prioritize sectors with development potential.
Within the framework of Turkey's bilateral and multilateral obligations, we will increase the use of domestic intermediate goods and value added in domestic production.
We will strengthen the innovative production structure by expanding university-industry cooperation areas in design.
We will encourage original design activities in export products for consumption and ensure the training of qualified designers.
We will support the registration of patents and the creation of international trademarks, and improve promotion and marketing support in line with the needs of exporters.
A list of target products that are inputs in the energy sector and whose production will provide high added value will be drawn up and investments for their production will be supported.
We will support the domestic production of equipment used in energy production facilities.
We will increase the share of domestic production of machinery and equipment used in facilities producing alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydroelectricity.
We will enable MTA to carry out mining activities abroad.
We will reduce the iron and steel industry's dependence on scrap inputs.

Within the scope of international trade in services negotiations, we will ensure that the rights of our investors abroad are secured and protected.
3.3. Inflation and Monetary Policy
As AK Party, our basic principle in the economy is to keep inflation permanently low and in single digits.
In line with this principle, we remain committed to achieving and maintaining price stability, which is the main objective of monetary policies.
In the second breakthrough period, monetary policy will also be supportive of the growth and employment policies that we will implement, provided that they do not conflict with the objective of achieving financial stability and price stability.
a. What We Did
AK Party governments have taken care to harmonize monetary policy with fiscal policy
and the fight against inflation as one of the pillars of economic stability.
Between 2002 and 2005, the CBRT implemented the implicit inflation regime, which is defined as the transition regime to explicit inflation targeting.
By 2005, the rate and volatility of inflation had been reduced.
In 2006, the Central Bank announced that the necessary preconditions were largely in place and that it would adopt an explicit inflation targeting regime.
In Turkey, the inflation target is set as a "point target" for a period of 3 years.
In 2004, we reduced year-end CPI inflation to single digits from 29.7 percent in 2002.
At the end of 2012, inflation was 6.2 percent, the lowest rate in 44 years.
In 2002, the gap between inflation expectations and target inflation, which was high in 2002, decreased significantly and converged to zero in the 2002-2006 period.
In the 2007-2014 period, the said difference fluctuated and hovered around 2.4 percent on average.
In 2002, the benchmark bond interest rate was around 70 percent, but interest rates have been on a significant decline and since 2010, the benchmark bond interest rate has been below 10 percent.
As of 2004, the real interest rate of the benchmark bond was around 15 percent, while the real interest rate fell below 5 percent and hovered around 2 percent on average in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, thanks to the maintenance of budget discipline in the public sector and the promotion of prudent borrowing in the private sector in the following period.
We increased our foreign exchange reserves (including gold) from USD 28.1 billion at the end of 2002 to USD 127.3 billion by the end of 2014.
In 2002, we increased our gold reserves from USD 1 billion to USD 20.1 billion by the end of 2014.
During this period, we dropped six zeros from the Turkish Lira and introduced a symbol to reinforce the prestige of the Turkish Lira.
b. What We Will Do
The main priority of monetary policies is to achieve and maintain price stability.
Monetary policy will also safeguard financial stability and support the government's growth and employment policies, provided that they do not conflict with the objective of achieving price stability.
Inflation targeting will remain the main monetary policy regime.
Inflation targets will be set by the government and the Central Bank for three-year periods.
The floating exchange rate regime will be maintained.
It will continue to be essential for the Central Bank to directly determine the monetary policy instruments it will use to achieve price stability.
The Financial Stability Committee and the Food Committee, with input from the Central Bank, will strengthen stability and efficiency in their respective areas.
3.4. Financial Markets and Financial Services
As the AK Party, we believe that economic breakthroughs will only be possible by maintaining stability in financial markets.
We see our fundamental reforms in financial markets and financial stability as the starting point for our economic success.
In order to sustain these achievements in a quality manner, we have established a financial market where all kinds of financial instruments can be issued to meet the needs of the real economy and finance growth,
transaction costs are low,
has a strong technological and human infrastructure,
effectively supervised,
We aim to create an innovative and more transparent financial market.
a. What We Did
During the first breakthrough period of the AK Party, we restructured state-owned banks to ensure that they operate according to the requirements of modern banking and international competition and prepare for privatization.
Affected by the 2001 crisis, we have made arrangements to strengthen the capital structures of private banks, resolve non-performing loans, reduce their foreign currency open positions and encourage their mergers and acquisitions in order to restore them to a healthier structure.
The banks taken under the SDIF were subjected to financial and operational restructuring and resolved through transfer, merger, sale and liquidation in order to prevent the growth of losses and accelerate the resolution process.
In light of the experiences in the period following the crisis, the BRSA's supervisory area was expanded, on-site supervision and remote surveillance functions were integrated, the supervision and surveillance framework was strengthened with new methods and approaches, and steps were taken to make it more pro-active.
As a result of our reforms, the ratio of banking sector assets to GDP increased from 60 percent in 2002 to 121.2 percent by the end of 2015.
The ratio of credit volume increased from 14 percent to 76.2 percent as of June 2015.
Regarding interest-free finance, we have made important arrangements with the opportunities provided by the new Capital Markets Law.
We introduced new financial instruments, which are prominent in international capital markets, into our system by regulating lease certificates (Sukuk).
In 2012, for the first time, we issued lease certificates amounting to TL 9.9 billion in the domestic market and USD 3.8 billion in the foreign market.
We developed an interest-free banking system.
The share of total assets of participation banks in total assets of the banking sector increased from 2.4 percent at end-2005 to 5.1 percent at end-July 2015.

With the Bank Cards and Credit Cards Law, we ensured the effective functioning of the card market.
We have introduced the possibility of a new payment plan for credit card debts for which a notice has been served, enforcement proceedings have been initiated, or which are classified as loans under follow-up by the bank.
With the regulation dated April 7, 2015, in order to improve SMEs' access to finance, we enabled the Treasury to transfer up to TL 2 billion to credit guarantee institutions and this amount can be increased up to 10 times by the Council of Ministers.
By the end of 2014, we had supported 5,862 companies with loans amounting to TL 3.2 billion.
In the 2003-2014 period, we provided 14 billion dollars of favorable external loans for SME financing.
In line with our goal of transforming Istanbul into an international financial center, we launched the Istanbul International Financial Center (IFC) Strategy and Action Plan.
As a result of these efforts, Istanbul first entered the Global Financial Centers Index in 2009 in 72nd place and rose to 42nd place in 2014.
We launched the Individual Participation Capital System in order to eliminate the problems of SMEs in accessing financing, to support businesses in achieving a more professional and corporate structure, and to increase investments and employment.
We liberalized the foreign exchange regime by removing restrictive barriers to foreign trade.
Thus, we reduced bureaucracy for importers and exporters and prevented our business community from unnecessary confrontation with judicial and administrative authorities.
We increased investors' access to financing from domestic markets by enabling them to utilize foreign currency loans above USD 5 million.
We established the Financial Stability Committee.
We adopted Basel-II standards to improve risk management and market discipline in banks, increase the effectiveness of capital adequacy measurements and thus create a sound and efficient banking system.

We will support public companies.
We will provide tax relief for the use of equity.
On March 26, 2015, the Law introduced tax incentives for equity financing.
For companies that increase their capital in cash, we will ensure that a certain portion of the increased capital can be deducted from corporate income each year.
With the law, we increased the amount of TL 1 billion that can be transferred from Treasury resources to credit guarantee institutions to TL 2 billion.
We are paving the way for Treasury guarantees up to TL 20 billion through the Credit Guarantee Fund.
With our "Istanbul International Finance Center Priority Transformation Program", we aim to establish a transparent market structure that will meet the needs of the real sector, where all kinds of financial instruments can be issued, has a strong physical, human and technological infrastructure, and is effectively supervised in order to transform Istanbul into an internationally competitive financial center.
By the end of the program period, we aim for Istanbul to be among the top 25 global financial centers and Turkey to be among the top 30 countries in terms of financial development.
Moreover, we aim to increase the share of the financial services sector in GDP from 3.4 percent in 2013 to 6 percent by the end of the program period.

3.5. Fiscal Discipline
As AK Party, we have based our budgets on building trust.
While disciplining our budget, we observed the general stability of the economy and ensured that the revenues we increased based on healthy resources were returned to our people as services by making the best use of them.
During our governments, we have demonstrated that fiscal discipline, strong growth performance and disinflation can be realized simultaneously.
In this way, we have broken the belief that inflation is necessary for growth that prevailed in our country in the past.
We ensured that our citizens on fixed and narrow incomes, who had suffered income losses in the inflationary environment for years, received more realistic income increases.
In the second breakthrough period, we aim to create an environment that will not compromise fiscal discipline, minimize uncertainties for our businesses, create a much healthier and predictable environment for our entrepreneurs, and increase production and tax revenues.
a. What We Did
Since 2002, our disciplined fiscal policy has led to a significant improvement in public finances.
We have removed from the agenda the issue of the sustainability of the debt stock, which was perceived as a serious risk in public finance in the past.
From 74 percent of GDP in 2002, the EU-defined general government debt stock declined to 33.5 percent at end-2014.
This rate is 89.6 percent in OECD countries and 85.4 percent in the Euro Area.
In order to broaden the investor base and diversify borrowing instruments, sukuk issuances were launched in domestic markets for the first time in 2012.
While many countries resorted to IMF resources and received support from central banks in the global crisis environment, we paid all of our debts to the IMF without putting pressure on the markets.
We also ensured the fulfillment of obligations to the CBRT and public banks.
The average interest rate on TL-denominated fixed-rate government domestic debt securities, which was 64 percent in 2002, realized as 9.7 percent in 2014.
As of July 2015, this rate declined to 9 percent.
We moved from interest budget to service budget.
In 2002, about 86 liras of every hundred liras of tax revenue collected was going to interest.
In 2014, only 14.1 liras out of 100 liras of tax revenue went to interest.
By reducing the interest burden in the budget, we have provided more resources to deliver services to citizens.
While the share of interest expenditures in budget expenditures was 43.2 percent in 2002, this ratio became 11.1 percent in 2014.
In 2002, the ratio of interest expenditures to national income was 14.8 percent; in 2014, we reduced this ratio to 2.9 percent, the lowest level of the last 23 years.
Since 2002, budget deficits and the public sector borrowing requirement have fallen rapidly as a result of our strict adherence to fiscal discipline.
During this period, the budget deficit, which was 11.5 percent of GDP, declined gradually to 1.3 percent at end-2014.
Similarly, the general government deficit decreased from 10.8 percent in 2002 to 0.7 percent in 2013.
This ratio was realized as 0.6 at the end of 2014.
In this framework, these deficit figures are well below the 3 percent deficit level set by the Maastricht criteria, which is a standard upper limit for EU countries.
We have used the fiscal space gained as a result of our reduction in interest expenditures to transform the social security system, in areas that directly affect our people such as education and health, in public infrastructure investments and in financing social expenditures.
In this framework, central government budget capital expenditures, which were 2.2 percent of GDP in 2002, realized as 2.8 percent in 2014.
Similarly, we increased total public sector social expenditures, including education, health and social protection expenditures, from 13.7 percent in 2002 to 18.4 percent in 2014.
We increased public spending on education from 12.3 billion TL in 2002 to 79.7 billion TL in 2014.
In 2015, we allocated 86.1 billion TL for public education spending.
We doubled public health expenditures from 13.6 billion TL in 2002 to 77.2 billion TL in 2014.
In 2015, we allocated 81 billion TL for public health expenditures.
The ratio of general government revenues to GDP increased significantly during our governments.
In 2013, we increased general government revenues excluding privatization from 30.8 percent of GDP in 2002 to 39.1 percent in 2013.
We expect this ratio to be 38.5 percent in 2014.
Similarly, the tax burden including social security premiums, which was 22.3 percent in 2002, realized as 28.5 percent in 2014.
Law No. 5345 established the Revenue Administration.
We introduced a "minimum subsistence allowance" system for real income taxation.
We have introduced income or corporate tax exemption for manufacturers' earnings from the sale of products manufactured in free zones.
We introduced a corporate tax reduction for corporations and joint ventures operating in the finance and insurance sectors on their earnings from investments subject to incentive certificates.
We increased the share of general budget taxes transferred to local governments.
We gathered tax audit units under a single roof.
In 2008, we reduced the income tax burden on a minimum wage earner with four children to zero with the minimum subsistence allowance we introduced.
Before this implementation, this burden was 12.8 percent.
We aim to reduce the income tax burden of minimum wage earners with three children to zero.
We reduced the VAT rates on basic necessities and services, which have a significant share in the expenditures of fixed and low-income citizens, to 8 percent for education, health and clothing, and to 1 percent for many food items.
We simplified the Value Added Tax (VAT) legislation.
We reduced the VAT rate to 1 percent for the acquisition of many machinery and equipment through financial leasing, thereby reducing the financial burden on investment.
As a result of these reductions, Turkey has the second lowest overall VAT rate among European Union countries.
b. What We Will Do
Within the framework of our "Priority Transformation Program for the Rationalization of Public Expenditures", which will enable us to maintain fiscal discipline and create more fiscal space, we will review existing expenditure programs and eliminate inefficient expenditures.
By allocating the fiscal space thus created to priority expenditure areas, we will ensure that the size of public primary expenditure is kept at a certain level.
With this program, we also aim to limit the size of public spending and the borrowing requirement, but mainly to improve the quality of spending.
Within the scope of the program, we will determine the people who will benefit from these aids according to more objective criteria in order to prevent abuse in social assistance and to reach everyone who deserves it.
We will complete the integration of databases of public institutions providing services in this field.
We will assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of agricultural subsidies.

Improving the valuation provisions in favor of the taxpayer,
We will implement regulations that reduce tax compliance costs.
Within the framework of our "Priority Transformation Program for Improving the Quality of Public Revenues", which we have prepared to further improve the revenue side of our budget, we basically aim to obtain public revenues from healthy and continuous sources through modern methods.
With the program, we aim to improve the quality of the entire process, from formulating revenue legislation to collecting revenues and informing the public.
Our basic approach is not to tax taxpayers more, but to improve the quality of revenues by broadening the tax base.
Under the program, we will continue to simplify tax legislation.
We will implement regulations on tax legislation in a process that includes the contributions of the society and relevant parties.
We will increase local governments' own revenues.

3.6. Reducing Informality
As one of the basic principles of a just administration, the AK Party aims to ensure that everyone has the right to work and earn on equal terms.
It is committed to asking everyone to contribute through a fair tax system.
We see that reducing the size of the informal economy will contribute to a qualified improvement in many macroeconomic factors such as economic stability, income distribution and employment in the medium and long term, increase the level of productivity and competitiveness in the economy, and increase public revenues.
With this approach, we adopt as a fundamental principle the encouragement of practices that will ensure efficiency in the economy and increase registered work, employment and voluntary taxation.
a. What We Did
In our first breakthrough period, we made important reforms to reduce the informal economy.
In the area of income tax, over the last decade, we have gradually reduced the number of tariff brackets from seven to four, and the tax rate in the top tariff bracket from 55 percent to 35 percent.
We abolished the practice known as tax rebate for wage earners and introduced the minimum subsistence allowance.
We reduced the corporate tax rate from 30-33 percent to 20 percent in the same period.
In recent years, we have made significant reductions in value added tax rates in many sectors, particularly in education, health, textiles and tourism.
In order to increase employment and encourage registered employment, we have implemented regulations such as 5-point premium reduction, incentives for youth and female employment, and incentives for disabled employment.
As a result of the VEDOP project, which was implemented to strengthen the technological infrastructure of our revenue administration, we started automation in tax offices.
We have created a data warehouse (VERÄ°A) within our revenue administration where information collected from the public and private sectors on taxation is stored.
Collections and payments exceeding 8 thousand TL are now made through banks and PTT.

b. What We Will Do
As AK Party, with our "Priority Transformation Program for Reducing the Informal Economy" that we will implement in the coming period, we will reduce the ratio of the informal economy to GDP.
and non-agricultural sectors by five percentage points each.
Within the scope of the program, we will measure the size of the informal economy, investigate the effects of informality and conduct an inventory study.
We will strengthen inspection capacity.
We will raise awareness in all segments of society through educational and inclusive methods.
We will develop methods to measure taxation capacity, analyze the extent of informal employment and address the problems it causes.

In particular, we will ensure that part-time workers are prevented from working unregistered by solving their additional payment problems related to GSS.
3.7. Public Capital Companies and Privatization
As AK Party, we aim to withdraw from public administration as much as possible within the rules of the market economy.
In line with this goal, we carried out large-scale privatizations during the first breakthrough period.
In the second breakthrough period, on the one hand, privatization practices continued,
On the other hand, we will increase efficiency in areas where the public sector is the operator.
In order to ensure that the market economy operates efficiently and as free as possible from public intervention, we will continue as a fundamental principle to carry out the activities of SEEs in a higher quality manner based on economic goals and objectives.
a. What We Did
From 1985 to the end of 2002, the total amount of privatization practices completed between 1985 and the end of 2002 was 8.1 billion dollars, whereas during the period of our governments, we privatized a total of 58.9 billion dollars with transparent methods and higher value formation.
Privatizations have contributed to the formation of a more competitive economic structure while generating revenue for the public sector.
In public enterprises not under the scope of privatization, we have initiated the process of preparing and implementing strategic plans in order to embed and disseminate the strategic management approach.
b. What We Will Do
It will ensure that state-owned enterprises operate in an open, transparent and accountable structure;
We will implement governance reform to ensure that management systems are competitive and in line with good governance principles.

In order to contribute to stable high growth, we will ensure that SEEs focus on high value-added products by improving their technological infrastructure and R&D activities, and take advantage of new export-oriented opportunities by utilizing domestic energy resources.
We will continue privatization implementations within a program determined within the framework of long-term sectoral priorities.
3.8. Savings
As AK Party, we see domestic savings as one of the important dynamics of economic growth.
Our main objective is to create a healthy growth structure by financing our productive investments, which form the basis of our economic policies, with domestic savings as well as international capital.
It will not only increase domestic savings,
We will direct them to high value-added investments in productive areas that will ensure Turkey's rapid growth.
In addition to the monetary and fiscal policies we will implement, we aim to raise domestic savings rates in line with our growth and current account deficit targets by providing incentives to households and firms.
a. What We Did
Domestic savings are very important for the health of the economic structure, and in Turkey they stood at around 15 percent of national income as of 2014.
An analysis of the data on the distribution of savings in the public and private sectors reveals that the low savings rates stem from the inadequacy of private sector savings.
As AK Party, we have significantly increased public savings thanks to the fiscal discipline we have achieved in the last 13 years.
In 2002, we increased the share of public savings in GDP by nearly 8 percentage points from minus 4.8 percent to 3.1 percent in 2014.
We made changes in the private pension system.
With the regulation, instead of the incentive practice based on deducting a certain percentage of income tax from premiums paid to the private pension system, we switched to a direct 25 percent state contribution practice.
We introduced macroprudential measures to prevent excessive acceleration in domestic credit volume, which suppresses savings.
In this context, we reorganized the relationship between credit card limits and income;
We increased the risk weights applied to credit card installments and credit card minimum payment amounts.
We rearranged the maturities of consumer loans
, we made a loan-to-value ratio adjustment in vehicle loans
and redefined the number of installments on credit cards.
In addition, within the framework of our targets to redirect savings to productive areas and to change the loan composition in favor of commercial loans, we reduced the general provision ratios for export loans and SME loans.
and Eximbank export credit insurance policies were included in the scope of credit risk mitigation techniques.
b. What We Will Do
As AK Party, we see savings as an important area of transformation in the economy.
With our "Priority Transformation Program on Increasing Domestic Savings and Preventing Waste", we aim to increase domestic savings, which is the most reliable and permanent source of financing, to direct increased domestic savings to productive investments and to reduce waste in order to ensure a high and stable growth dynamic.
We aim to raise our domestic savings rate to 19 percent in the medium term.
With the program, we will review the practices regarding the taxation of value increase gains on the disposal of real estate.
We will review tax exemptions and exemptions for loans used to finance real estate purchases, taking into account social and economic objectives.
In order to increase capacity and productivity in the manufacturing industry, we will introduce Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax (BITT) exemption in the financing of machinery-equipment investments in the manufacturing industry.
In line with international obligations, we will identify luxury goods and/or consumption goods with high import intensity and impose deterrent taxation.
We will develop special purpose savings mechanisms to encourage long-term savings.

Increasing economic growth and employment as a Party that commits to inauguration dates while laying the foundations of investments,
We attach great importance to investments to improve the competitiveness and business environment of our country by providing the necessary infrastructure.
Not only in terms of growth and employment,
ensuring regional development,
development of our human resources,
in terms of increasing the welfare and quality of life of our citizens
Our main goal is to continue effective and efficient investments without slowing down.
We will continue to pave the way for and encourage private sector investments through our policies to improve the investment climate, which we carry out simultaneously with public investments.
a. What We Did
In the context of public investments during our government, we have both completed the ongoing projects from previous years and developed new projects and started their construction.
In 2002, the completion period of investments was 8.5 years, while in 2015, we reduced this period to 4 years, less than half of it.
Thus, we significantly increased the efficiency of the public investment program and gave it a rational structure.
During this period, we reduced unnecessary bureaucratic procedures by providing significant flexibility to project implementing organizations during the project implementation phase.
In 2002, public investment was USD 11.5 billion at current prices, private sector investment was USD 28.4 billion and total fixed capital investment was USD 39.9 billion. In 2014, we increased the amount of public investment alone to USD 39.2 billion.
With the private sector's investment of USD 126.9 billion, the total amount of fixed capital investment in 2014 reached USD 166.2 billion.
Thus, total fixed capital investment amounted to USD 1.6 trillion in the 2002-2014 period.
We have completed and realized many important and major projects in areas such as irrigation, energy, transportation, education, health, urban infrastructure and technological research.
In the 2002-2014 period, the cumulative amount of international direct investment reached USD 150 billion, thanks to the investment climate that enabled global capital to prefer Turkey.
With innovative practices such as KÃYDES, SODES, BELDES, SUKAP, Attraction Centers, GAP Action Plan, we have achieved significant local and regional success.
While the share of public investment allocations for the provinces in the GAP, DAP, KOP and DOKAP regions in total allocations was 20 percent in 2002, we have gradually increased this share to over 30 percent in recent years.
Between 1986 and the end of September 2015, contracts were signed for 200 projects with a total contract value of USD 116 billion and a total investment of USD 48.5 billion under Public-Private Partnership models.
Contracts for 132 of these projects, with a total contract value of USD 106.2 billion and an investment value of USD 39.3 billion, were signed in the period starting from 2003 until the end of September 2015.
We have made many arrangements for the private sector within the scope of the Reform Program to Improve the Investment Environment.
In this framework, we made it possible to establish a company in one day.
We abolished the minimum capital required for foreign direct investment.
We switched from a permission system to an information system.
We abolished the distinction between foreign and domestic investments in pre-incorporation procedures.

and to create more qualified job opportunities.
To this end, while growing our economy,
on the other hand, we aim to achieve employment-friendly growth.
We consider employment not only as an economic indicator, but also as a fundamental area of reflection of economic growth on social welfare.
With the idea that the jobs we will develop and the employment we will create will increase our economic dynamism and social welfare; we aim to achieve employment-friendly growth in our second breakthrough period.
and we aim to permanently reduce unemployment to low rates in an environment where the labor market functions more effectively.
a. What We Did
Between 2002 and 2014, our first breakthrough period as AK Party, we achieved a significant decrease in the unemployment rate and increased labor force participation, especially for women.
We reduced tax burdens on employment.
Between 2002 and 2014, we provided employment opportunities for a total of 4.6 million additional people.
Especially with the impact of the global crisis, while the unemployment rate increased in many countries and new job opportunities could not be created, our country was able to achieve large increases in employment with a very successful performance.
Our active labor force policies and the employment-friendly policies we pursued in various sectors contributed to this success as much as growth.
To encourage employment, we continue to offer a discount on employer premiums.
In addition to the 5-point employer premium incentive, a 6-point employer premium incentive was introduced last year.
We have allocated a total of 9.4 billion TL in the 2015 Budget for these insurance premium incentives.
We implemented policies to encourage the employment of young people and women.
In this framework, employment increased from 21.3 million people in 2002 to 25.9 million people in 2014.

a. What We Did
During the first breakthrough period, as AK Party, we took important steps to develop entrepreneurship and SMEs.
For the first time, we prepared and put into effect the SME Strategy and Action Plan.
By making regulations on SMEs, we implemented important innovations from the definition of SMEs to SME support systems.
Considering the importance of appropriate investment location and clustering for investors, we have completed 87 of the 157 OIZ projects whose infrastructure has been completed so far.
While providing a favorable investment climate in these areas, we have also taken environmental measures.
As of today, 685 thousand people are employed in 87 OIZs completed in the last 13 years.
While 1.7 billion TL of credit support was provided to 70 OIZs until 2002, we have provided 1.5 billion TL of credit to 87 OIZs in the last 13 years.
We provided 1.5 million jobs in OIZs.
From 2011 to 2015, we allocated 2,101 empty parcels to investors in OIZs free of charge.

The concept of development includes economic development but goes far beyond it.
Our understanding of inclusive development is based on reaching out to every individual and every region of our country, mobilizing all the energy of our country and realizing our vision for 2023 and beyond by working together.
In this framework, balanced and fair distribution of increasing prosperity among various segments and regions is among the fundamental policies adopted by our Party.
Sustainable development creates equality of opportunity for the current generation, as well as intergenerational justice.
With this understanding, it treats the environment with a sense of responsibility towards future generations and considers it as a trust.
On the other hand, when we take into account that an increasing proportion of the world's population lives in cities and that wealth and culture develop in cities, our main priority is to create livable cities.
In this process, we aim to ensure that our cities, which we believe will rise on our civilization, develop in a way that reflects the colors of our culture and the lines of the times we live in, has a robust infrastructure, is resistant to disasters and is sensitive to the environment.
5.1. Balanced Distribution of Welfare across Regions
As AK Party, our understanding is to reduce the differences between the regions of our country,
to ensure total development by bringing living standards closer together.
Turkey is a country where regional development gaps are decreasing,
prosperity is spread more evenly across the country,
We will continue our unremitting efforts to make Turkey a country where economic and social integration is strengthened.
With our more inclusive, equitable and participatory development approach, to increase the competitiveness of all our regions, especially our underdeveloped regions, in a qualified manner
and we see mobilizing local potential as a fundamental task.
In this framework, we are developing our new regional policy on the axis of equity and competition.
a. What Have We Done?
As a result of the policies and practices we have developed during our AK Party governments, the income imbalance between regions tends to decrease.
While the difference between the highest and lowest level 2 regions was 4.3 times in 2004, we reduced it to 3.9 times in 2011.
For the first time, we prepared the National Strategy for Regional Development (2014-2023) in order to determine general policies and priorities at national level in the field of regional development.

The amount we have allocated to these projects is 2.15 billion TL and the total budget amount including co-financing is 3.9 billion TL.
With the incentive system, we made important arrangements to reduce regional development differences.
In terms of support elements, we gave the largest share to the provinces in the 5th and 6th Regions.
We reduced the corporate tax rate for investments realized in these regions to 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
Since the entry into force of the Investment Incentive System, the amount of fixed investment envisaged for investments to be made in our 5th and 6th Regions has reached 31.7 billion TL
and the employment foreseen within the scope of incentivized investments has reached approximately 133.7 thousand.
We established Investment Support Offices (ISOs) in 81 provinces within the agencies.
Investment support offices continue their activities to attract investors by promoting the business and investment environment of their provinces, and to inform and support entrepreneurs at every stage of investment.
Through our Investment Support Offices, since their establishment, we have provided consultancy services to more than 70,000 investors on various issues, and prepared more than 2,000 reports, analyses and promotional brochures.

5.2. Spatial Planning and Zoning
We believe that our cities should be places that encompass and embrace all people, regardless of their social and economic status.
In the past, while our cities were shaped by the essence of our civilization, they were also cities that melted the people living in them in accordance with the essence and spirit of our civilization.
Our vision of the city is also our vision of civilization.
Our urban heritage is also our civilization accumulation.
We are not only responsible for today's cities, today's people, today's Turkey.
To make our people the focus of the city with the awareness of carrying the responsibility of building tomorrow from today and zoning tomorrow on our shoulders;
Our basic principle in spatial planning is to transform our cities into quality living centers where people live in peace, happiness and self-confidence.
a. What Have We Done?
While the country's population increased by 10 percent in total during our AK Party governments, the urban population increased by 48 percent in settlements with a population over 20 thousand.
In this period, the urbanization rate rose from 65.5 percent to 87.2 percent.
With Law No. 6360, the jurisdiction of metropolitan municipalities was defined as provincial borders, which led to an increase in the urbanization rate from 72.3 percent in 2012 to 86.7 percent in 2013.

In order to plan the coasts in a healthy way, we ensured that 98 percent of the coastal edge lines were determined.
b. What will we do?
As AK Party, our policy in the coming period in all our places, especially in our ancient cities, will be horizontal construction, not vertical.
Our top priorities will be to protect and develop our cities as places to live in harmony with nature and culture.
While ensuring the welfare and happiness of our society within a sustainable development approach, we will also keep in mind that this nature and environment is a trust of future generations.
We will take the necessary steps in all sectors to develop construction, zoning and settlement in line with these principles.
Each city will be integrated into the country with its economy, culture, historical heritage, handicrafts, agriculture and tourism and will make a name for itself.
On the other hand, the most advanced techniques, technologies, developments, commercial and economic connections at the global level will also contribute to the branding of our cities.
Our goal is to transform our cities into human-friendly, environmentally friendly, aesthetic, participatory and prosperous brand cities.
Accordingly, we will revise the zoning legislation in line with the needs of the day.
We will improve urban design principles and practices to facilitate access to services for people who require special attention, such as the disabled, the elderly and those with mobility limitations.
Zoning of public land in cities, economic development,
We will ensure its more active use on the basis of common socio-cultural benefit.

5.4. Urban Infrastructure
Since the day we were founded as AK Party, we have adopted the principle that our citizens can live peacefully and prosperously in cities only with a strong urban infrastructure.
With this approach, ensuring that infrastructure services are accessible, complete, high quality, healthy and affordable is among our indispensable criteria in serving our citizens.
We have placed human health and peace of mind first at the center of our urban policy.
With this understanding, we are committed to improving the quality of life of our citizens in the city.
a. What Have We Done?
The AK Party demonstrates the importance it attaches to the quality of urban life through its investments in the infrastructure of cities.
One of the main factors that improve the quality of life in a city is the adequacy and strength of its infrastructure.
In this context, we provided drinking water to 41 million people with 70 drinking water projects commissioned between 2003 and 2014.
Through 61 modern drinking water treatment plants, we ensured that 7 million m3 of water, which 41 million people need daily, is treated at EU standards.
We have prepared Basin Protection Action Plans for 25 basins to ensure more efficient management of water in terms of quality and quantity.
In 2008, we prepared Drinking Water Action Plans for 81 provinces to ensure uninterrupted supply of drinking and potable water to our cities in the long term.

Within the principles of the Solid Waste Master Plan, we will finance the solid waste facilities of local governments at the feasibility, project and implementation stages through a structure similar to SUKAP.
5.5. Local Governments
As AK Party, we envisage a rational distribution of services between the central administration and local governments with an understanding of the integrity of the administration.
We position central and local governments as complementary and fundamental elements in the process of delivering services to our citizens in the most effective way.
In the period ahead, decentralization of public services within the framework of centralized standards will continue to be our fundamental principle.
We are based on a healthy cooperation and coordination between the central government and local governments and we believe that local governments should be the main responsible for all kinds of public service provision of a local nature.
We envisage that local governments will improve their administrative and financial capacities and work quickly and efficiently as service units that are closest to citizens and most responsive to local demands.
a. What Have We Done?
In our country, we have made progress towards providing local services in a more efficient, fast and qualified manner, with a transparent, participatory, accountable, environmentally sensitive administration that takes into account the needs of disadvantaged groups and ensures financial sustainability.
We initiated restructuring efforts in local administrations and made many fundamental arrangements in the areas of responsibility, duties and services of these administrations.
Within the framework of the restructuring of local governments, we increased the number of metropolitan municipalities and expanded municipal boundaries to provincial borders in order to increase efficiency, coordination and quality in services by utilizing economies of scale.
In these places, we ensured the closure of special provincial administrations and reduced the number of municipalities.
In 2002, the ratio of the population living under municipal administration to the total population was 81 percent, while this ratio was 93 percent in 2014.
While in 2002 the number of municipalities was 3,228, this number dropped to 1,397 in 2015.
While the number of metropolitan cities was 16 in 2002, this number increased to 30 with the regulation made in 2014.
Law No. 5216 on Metropolitan Municipalities, Law No. 5302 on Special Provincial Administration and Law No. 5393 on Municipalities.
We enacted the Law No. 5355 on Local Administration Unions in order to overcome financing difficulties in urban infrastructure and to benefit from economies of scale.
Training projects are carried out by many of our institutions in order to meet the training needs of local administration personnel.
We completed the BEPER project within the Ministry of Interior to measure the performance of municipalities.
Our Local Information Project, which aims to collect basic data on municipalities in a common database, is ongoing.
We launched the Cloud Municipality Project under the Ministry of Interior in order to provide municipal services to citizens on the internet, to make local services more efficient, less costly and accessible from anywhere, and to enable payments such as taxes and invoices to be made over the internet.
b. What We Will Do
We have a human and service-oriented management approach in local governments.
As stated in our party program, our activities and efforts to increase the weight of localization and local governments in the state structure, which is a necessity of our age and a basic condition of advanced democracy, will continue in the coming period.
Local governments should not be seen as a mere administrative and technical apparatus;
advanced democracy,
institutionalization of governance,
citizen empowerment and participation in governance,
transparency and accountability and
We see it as a means of increasing effectiveness and efficiency in public service delivery.
In this context, we will continue our legal and institutional arrangements to further strengthen local governments.

5.6. Rural Development
As AK Party, we consider rural areas as a complementary element of balanced development and social life in urban-rural integrity.
We also see rural areas as places that feed our cities and our country, provide basic inputs, and add value to the land and environment we live on.
With this approach, delivering basic services to our citizens living in rural areas,
improving their quality of life
and the protection and development of rural life are among our main priorities.
To ensure that our rural population lives productively in rural areas by meeting the basic and infrastructure needs of our rural population with the motto that sustainable development is possible through rural production and protection
We consider it vital for the healthy and balanced development of our country.
a. What Have We Done?
As AK Party, during the first breakthrough period, we developed various projects to improve rural infrastructure and ensure development, and launched the largest rural infrastructure move in the history of the Republic.
We prepared national rural development strategy documents (NRDS) for Turkey for the first time. NRDS-I covers the period 2007-2013 and NRDS-II covers the period 2014-2020.
We also prepared the Rural Development Plan (2010-2013) for the first time in our country.

5.8. Disaster Management
For the AK Party, which puts people at the center of all its policies and practices, human life is the top priority in our country and in every corner of our world.
With this motto, we see it as not only a duty but also a humanitarian responsibility to strive to ensure firstly the safety of life and secondly the safety of property of our citizens and all people within our reach.
Our basic service principle in this field is to protect our citizens from natural disasters and situations requiring urgent intervention and to make efforts to ensure that they are prepared for disasters by gaining the necessary awareness.
a. What Have We Done?
As AK Party, we established the Disaster and Emergency Management (AFAD) Presidency in 2009 in order to make disaster and emergency services more effective and to end the confusion of authority between institutions.
By ending the confusion of authority in the field of disaster and emergency management, we have created a structure that can respond flexibly, immediately and effectively.
For this purpose, we established the Turkish Disaster Response System.
With the Turkey Disaster Response Plan, we have defined the roles and responsibilities of all public, civil, private sector institutions and organizations in order to be "prepared for minute zero".
As a result of the restructuring of AFAD provincial directorates as provincial organizations, we have transformed AFAD into an implementing organization of approximately 5,600 people under the Prime Ministry.
We enacted the "Catastrophe Insurance Law" No. 6305 in order to popularize the natural disaster insurance system and make it more effective.
In addition to title deed and mortgage loan transactions, we also introduced Compulsory Earthquake Insurance (CEI) checks in electricity and water subscription transactions.
We made it possible for the Natural Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP) to provide coverage for other natural disasters.
The insurance coverage rate increased from 4 percent in 1999 to 40 percent as of September 2015.
We have completed 25 of the Disaster Logistics warehouses that we envisaged to be established in 27 provinces.
2 more are under construction and will be completed in 2016.
We prepared guidelines for the creation of integrated disaster hazard maps and started to produce the maps.
We have completed the establishment of uninterrupted and secure communication systems in 4 provinces and we plan to extend the system to all provinces by the end of 2016.
In 2013, the Turkish Disaster Response Plan (TAMP) entered into force.
We ensured that the EUR 1 billion 213 million of external financing provided for the activities carried out under the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project, which was established to prepare Istanbul for a possible earthquake, was mainly used for the seismic risk retrofitting or demolition and reconstruction of priority public buildings.
Demonstrating an unprecedented level of disaster management in the past, we rapidly responded to the earthquakes in ElazÄ±Ä, Van and KÃ¼tahya, the Soma mine accident and many other disasters such as floods and landslides in our country.
After the Van earthquake, we hosted 175 thousand people in temporary accommodation centers in 35 container cities.
Under the coordination of AFAD, we built approximately 41 thousand disaster houses from 2010 to August 2014.
We established the "Turkey Disaster Risk Management System" within the framework of transition from crisis management to risk management.
We launched the pilot project in KahramanmaraÅ this year.
With the "Creation of Integrated Disaster Hazard Maps" project, we prepared technical guidelines and ensured standardization in studies.
In cooperation and coordination with institutions and organizations in the field of technological disasters such as transportation, industrial, mining, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear accidents, climate change and critical structure collapses, we prepared Turkey's "technological disasters roadmap".
Within the framework of the "Disaster Ready Turkey" campaign, we trained more than one million citizens.
Within the scope of this campaign, we are carrying out "Disaster Ready Family", "Disaster Ready School", "Disaster Ready Workplace", "Disaster Ready Youth" and "Disaster Ready Media" projects.
We attach importance to science and the use of high technologies in disaster management.
In this context, we are carrying out the "Disaster Management and Decision Support System" project to effectively manage all our resources in case of a disaster and the "Uninterrupted and Secure Communication System (KGHS) Project" to ensure the sustainability of communication in case of a disaster.

Thanks to our international aid activities that reflect our nation's cultural humanitarianism to the whole world, Turkey allocated 0.21 percent of its GDP for humanitarian aid in 2013, according to the Global Humanitarian Aid report, and became the country providing the highest humanitarian aid in proportion to its national income.
In 2012 and 2013, Turkey ranked third in the list of top international aid donors, behind the United States and the United Kingdom.
In 2013, Turkey provided 7 times more humanitarian aid than the US based on its GDP.
We became a member of the Donor Support Group of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
This gave us a say in aid to other countries through the UN.
b. What will we do?
As AK Party, our goal in disaster management is to create a disaster-resilient country and society by completing the transformation in disaster management initiated under the coordination of AFAD.
We will establish disaster and emergency management centers of standard type and quality in every province to address the need for effective local centralization of disaster and emergency services and inter-agency cooperation.
We are improving our aerial search and rescue capacity to reach every part of our country within 1.5 hours at the latest.
We are establishing an uninterrupted and secure communication system to ensure uninterrupted communication in case of disaster.
In this context, we will complete our pilot work in 4 provinces by the end of the year and will be expanding it to all provinces by the end of 2017.
We will raise awareness against disasters by providing trainings to our citizens before and after disasters.
With the high level of awareness of our people, logistics centers, temporary settlement infrastructure, strong search and rescue and response capacity, and disaster-resistant building stock, we are shifting from crisis management to a structure that prioritizes risk reduction.
Our aim is to create a community structure that is resilient to disasters even in the worst-case scenarios.
We will continue efforts to expand the natural disaster insurance system.
We will ensure that infrastructure facilities are built to be more disaster-resistant and that construction supervision is strengthened through independent, competent and authorized persons and institutions.
In this framework, we will reorganize the building inspection legislation.
We will enact a holistic framework law on disaster management that will include risk management and activities to increase community resilience.
We will ensure that various legislations including land use decisions, particularly spatial planning legislation, are harmonized with Law No. 7269.
We will redefine the responsibilities and distribution of duties of institutions and organizations responsible for disaster and emergency services.
"Disaster Logistics Centers" have been established and put into operation in 15 regions in our country.
In this way, with our tent stock that can accommodate 600 thousand people, we will quickly deliver the materials needed in disasters to disaster areas.
In 2016, we will host the UN's first World Humanitarian Summit.
Our aim is to complete the transformation process and become disaster-resilient within the sustainable development model and to be more prepared for the worst-case scenarios in cooperation with NGOs.
In this context, we will finalize the Turkey Disaster Management Strategy Document.
We will increase the number of Regional Disaster Training Centers and Mobile Disaster Training Centers.
We aim to prepare an Integrated Disaster Hazard Map.
We will establish the Turkish Disaster Information Bank covering all kinds of scientific studies.
In order to reach every part of our country in 1.5 hours at the latest, we are developing aerial search and rescue capacity with 4 helicopters in Ankara, Bursa, Erzurum and Samsun.
Since the day AK Party was founded, we have made it our mission to establish justice not only in economic and social life, but also in politics and foreign policy.
We have never abandoned this sense of duty, which we consider sacred, regardless of internal and external conditions.
We centered our foreign policy on the axis of equity.
As AK Party, we have put our seal of success on our foreign policy in a way that is incomparable to any previous government in the history of modern Turkey.
Our foreign policy was based on both continuity and change.
Under our governments, we have provided Turkey with an independent, pro-active foreign policy that generates policies and perspectives.
At a time when crises intensified in our region, we did not refrain from dealing with crises in a resilient manner.
Our strong civilian administration based on political stability has been a great advantage in foreign policy, as in other areas.
During our governments, we institutionalized a visionary and realistic foreign policy tradition that sees no contradiction between the interests of the country and universal principles reflecting the common values of the world.
During this period, we have endeavored to ensure that Turkey, inspired by its economic strength, historical heritage and universal values, fulfills its responsibilities for a better political order in the world.
We have continued to contribute to the resolution of problems affecting the lives of communities elsewhere in the world, with particular emphasis on achieving the goals of democracy, political stability respecting human rights and economic development in neighboring regions.
We encouraged the participation and activities of civil society organizations and citizens,
We have expanded the vision of our foreign policy beyond relations between states to relations between societies and citizens.
During the period of our governments, we pioneered the development and improvement of the mechanisms of the international system to solve some chronic problems on a global and regional scale, and as an active member of the United Nations system, we pointed out the problems in this system and developed solutions.
We believe that a more prosperous, stable and peaceful world must be built in dialogue and cooperation with other countries of the world, and we consider it our moral duty to assume responsibility and leadership for this purpose.
Turkey today is not a passive spectator, it is a country that takes initiative and responsibility, not a country that follows others.
Going beyond responding to the developments in our region, Turkey has determined its positions on global issues and has become a beacon of hope for oppressed peoples who have been forgotten or excluded in an extremely turbulent period with its multidimensional foreign policy that puts people's demands for rights and law at the center, sincerely internalizing the moral and conscientious approach.
Whereas before it was a country that followed in the footsteps of other countries and could not even protect its own interests,
Today, we are a leading country in our region and in the world.
We mobilized an understanding that sees foreign policy as a strategy, not just diplomacy.
Under the leadership of our President Erdogan, the AK Party stood on the side of the just, not the powerful, and defended the ideals of justice, freedom and democracy for the oppressed and victimized of the world.
As AK Party, we aimed to make Turkey a pioneering country.
We acted on the principle of growing our power on the axis of compassion, mercy and justice.
We have adopted the principle of being a country that is integrated with the world in every field, not disconnected from the world.
Our foreign policy has been vision-based and multidimensional, and will continue to be multidimensional.
We see Turkey's European Union aspiration as a strategic goal.
However, we define our relations with the European Union as a complement, not an alternative, to our other relations.
In the new period, we will work day and night to fly the Turkish flag in every corner of the world and to pursue an effective, result-oriented and conscientious foreign policy in all basins around Turkey.
We will not abandon any brotherly people who pin their hopes on us.
We aim to increase the reputation of our country in the coming period with our policies that we implement on a global scale and regional effectiveness, and the regional and national collaborations we have established.
and we will continue to contribute more to global development.
Our foreign policy achievements are driving our economic prosperity forward, primarily by increasing trade and international direct investments
and nurtures our social development based on mutual interaction.
Our diplomatic achievements and increasing international relations provide new cooperation opportunities for our country in every field, especially in trade and finance, and this contributes significantly to the development of our country.
6.1. Effective, Equitable, Reputable Foreign Policy
Our vision of a just world has both strengthened and enriched our foreign policy.
Today, the principles of justice and solidarity, which are our historical mission, lie at the heart of Turkey's efforts to help the oppressed, the victimized, the refugees and the needy all over the world.
In this respect, the "value-oriented foreign policy" that our country insists on pursuing is the democratization of the international system, which is on the rise in the world;
It adds considerable strength to their demand for the principle of justice to dominate both politics and the economy.
a. What Have We Done?
We have adopted as a general policy to reflect the full potential of our country in our relations with the world.
From agriculture to energy, from transportation to cultural relations, from health to technical assistance, we have given an international character to the activities of all our institutions.
In addition to all relevant ministries, our public and non-governmental organizations such as TIKA, Turkish Airlines, Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities, Yunus Emre Institute, Turkish Religious Foundation, AFAD, Turkish Red Crescent, Public Diplomacy Coordinatorship are very active in every region of the world in full harmony.
We have stood and are standing firm against injustice, all kinds of prejudice and Islamophobia.
We have always raised our voices against the rising anti-Islamism in Europe and other parts of the world.
We extend our hand to the victimized, oppressed and needy in every corner of the world.
As a result, Turkey's name is much more respected in many parts of the world today.
As Turkey has built its democracy and economy on solid foundations, it has also made great strides in foreign policy.
One of the greatest achievements of our 12 years in power is that we have made foreign policy a national issue.
With our effective, decisive and strategic management approach, all our official institutions now contribute to foreign policy.
We have established a close relationship between our economic achievements and our foreign policy achievements.
Our outward-looking, self-confident and productive business world both contributes to the strength of our country and strengthens its relations with the world in the areas opened to them by our foreign policy.
As a result, exports have increased and domestic and foreign investments have gained high momentum.
Our achievements in the field of foreign policy have visibly increased during our governments.
In 2015, we increased the number of missions of the Republic of Turkey abroad from 166 in 2003 to 259.
While many countries downsized their foreign missions during the global economic crisis, we continued to grow rapidly.
The world's interest in Turkey has also increased significantly.
Today, Istanbul has become the second city in the world, after New York, with the largest number of consulates general.
Turkey plays an active role in all international organizations in order to be one of the actors that have a say in determining the reshaped global order.
In this context, Turkey has been adopting a more pro-active approach in the United Nations, of which it is a founding member, in recent years, and has endeavored to make active contributions and play a constructive and conciliatory role in all issues on the UN agenda.
As the most important multilateral forum for the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security, Turkey's non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council for the period 2009-2010 has provided Turkey with additional opportunities in the international arena and within the UN.
Turkey also upgraded its cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to "Strategic Partnership" through the Partnership Framework Agreement signed in 2011.
We are also making significant contributions to global stability and peace through many projects and initiatives at the global level within and outside the UN.
Launched in 2005 under the leadership of Turkey and Spain, the Alliance of Civilizations (AC) was endorsed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and has become an influential UN initiative with 142 countries and international organizations currently in the Group of Friends.
The "Mediation for Peace" initiative we have been running with Finland since 2010;
In 2011, we established and co-chaired the "Global Forum on Counterterrorism" with the United States;
Turkey's co-chairmanship (with the EU) of the Horn of Africa/Yemen Working Group under the Forum is an example of Turkey's efforts of this nature.
We assumed a leading role in UNESCO, which operates within the UN system to spread the culture of peace globally; we made our country represented in all sectors of the organization, from education to culture, science to communication.
In June 2014, we secured our country's election to UNESCO's World Heritage Committee after thirty years - a record number of votes in the history of UNESCO elections.
We established 41 Yunus Emre Turkish Cultural Centers in 33 countries with the aim of increasing Turkey's effectiveness in the cultural field by creating a global network of cultural centers.
As a result of our increasing power and effectiveness, Turkey has assumed rotating presidencies in many international and regional organizations of which it is a member, and hosted important summits of these organizations.
In the field of human rights, which is among the priority areas of our foreign policy, we have attached great importance to increasing our contribution and effectiveness in the international arena on this priority moral issue by assuming active roles in various international cooperation platforms, especially in the UN, Council of Europe and OSCE.
In our democratic reforms and regulations on fundamental human rights and freedoms, we closely followed the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe, of which we are a founding member, and the case law of the ECtHR.
b. What will we do?
Turkey's foreign policy based on humanity, justice and democracy is both appreciated and widely accepted in the region and around the world.
We will continue to develop our foreign policy, which we have developed based on solid values with a long-term perspective, taking into account the world and country conditions in the coming period.
We are in the right place in front of history.
We will continue this stance in the coming period with a wider, more effective and greater effort.
The Turkish Cypriot people's rightful place in the international community is one of our main priorities.
We will continue to take decisive steps to strengthen the TRNC's economic infrastructure and increase its welfare.
We will continue our constructive contribution as guarantor countries and support the efforts of the United Nations for a negotiated, just and lasting settlement in Cyprus based on the fundamental constituent will of both peoples, their political equality and their co-ownership of the island.
Since 2011, we will continue to play a unifying and constructive role in North Africa and the Middle East, which is undergoing a painful transformation process, as we did during our previous government.
Turkey has supported in a principled manner the struggle of the brotherly peoples of the Middle East for human dignity and the rights and freedoms that this dignity requires.
As in the past, our Party will continue to defend the right of everyone to democracy based on the will of the people, one of the fundamental values of the Republic of Turkey.
Contributing to the stabilization of North Africa and the Middle East with the understanding that security, prosperity and peace are inseparable,
pursuing multidimensional policies based on mutual benefit with countries in the region will be among our priorities.
Opposing conflicts and exclusionary approaches based on ethnic and sectarian divisions in the Middle East,
We will promote social integration and political stability.
The basic principles of our foreign policy towards Iraq are the protection of its territorial integrity, the establishment of security and stability in the country, the strengthening of democracy, the establishment of internal peace, and the transformation of Iraq into a state that creates security and prosperity for the region by integrating with its neighbors and the international community.
Within the framework of these principles, our Party will continue to support and contribute to the establishment of an inclusive political power in the light of the serious threats and challenges facing Iraq.
One of the most important conditions for lasting stability in the Middle East is a just, comprehensive and viable solution to the Palestinian conflict.
Our active efforts for a sustainable peace in the region and Turkey's strong support for the Palestinian National Unity Government will continue in the period ahead.
Progress in the normalization process, which began after Israel apologized for the Mavi Marmara attack in March 2013, will not be possible until Israel ends its attacks on Palestine and its brutal embargo, particularly in Gaza.
The four-year conflict in Syria is high on our agenda in terms of the threats it poses to regional security and stability, in addition to the humanitarian devastation that deepens with each passing day.
As a matter of humanitarian and conscientious responsibility, the AK Party governments will continue to provide the necessary assistance to heal the wounds of Syrians and Iraqis who fled from the regime's oppression and DAESH terrorism and to stand by our Syrian and Iraqi brothers and sisters in their difficult times.
Turkey will make every effort to help Syrian refugees make their voices heard around the world and will be the voice of Syrians on all relevant international platforms.
Establishing an environment of peace and stability in the Balkans, where we have deep-rooted historical, humanitarian and cultural ties, is among the priorities of our Party.
In this context, our main objective is to contribute to the prevention of ethnic, religious and political tensions that have the potential to threaten peace and stability in the region.
We will continue to strengthen our relations with the Balkan countries by utilizing the trilateral mechanisms of Turkey-Bosnia-Herzegovina-Serbia and Turkey-Croatia-Serbia and to contribute to the establishment of an environment of social peace by making peace and stability permanent.
We will also continue our strong support to the Balkan countries' perspective of integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.
In addition to our economic relations, we will continue to develop our good relations with the institutions and member states of the European Union, with which we are negotiating full membership.
While developing our bilateral relations, we will increase our cooperation for stability and prosperity in our nearby geographies, especially in the Balkans, North Africa and the Middle East.
Recognizing that our accession to the European Union will contribute significantly to the Union in many areas, especially economic dynamism, we will start a new process by developing relations between society and business communities beyond inter-state relations.
We aim to strengthen the positive agenda in Turkey-EU relations with new initiatives such as lifting visas, updating our customs union and deepening our financial cooperation.
In the period ahead, we will continue to develop our relations with the United States, with which our country cooperates closely in a wide geography and with which we stand in solidarity against regional and international problems, on the basis of mutual respect and trust.
The dynamics of our relations with Russia, another important partner and an important actor in terms of regional cooperation, is closely related to the vast geography in which we are located.
In the period ahead, we will endeavor to maintain and further strengthen the momentum in our relations with Russia, particularly in energy and trade.
We will continue to support efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in our neighbor and strategic partner Ukraine, which can be seen as a source of regional instability and has the potential to affect international peace and security, on the basis of Ukraine's territorial integrity and international law.
We will continue to support the dialogue efforts between Ukraine and Russia and take necessary initiatives to ensure the security and prosperity of the Crimean Tatar Turks, the original people of Crimea, and to expand and secure their rights and interests.
In line with the peaceful settlement of conflicts in the South Caucasus, our country will continue to make efforts to end the occupation of Azerbaijani territories and Nagorno-Karabakh and to end the tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
In the period ahead, our steps towards normalization of relations with Armenia will continue.
We expect Armenia to adopt an inclusive, fair-memory-seeking approach that will pave the way for mutual benefit and cooperation, and to respond to our initiatives with foresight.
We believe that this is the only way to bring peace, stability and prosperity to the Caucasus.
Turkey-Azerbaijan-Georgia, Turkey-Azerbaijan-Iran and Turkey-Turkmenistan-Azerbaijan trilateral mechanisms in the Caucasus have also started to bear fruit.
Further development of our relations with the Caucasus and Central Asian countries and further strengthening of the recently established Turkic Council are among our main objectives.
Africa is one of our top priorities.
In the coming period, we will continue this approach, which aims to identify additional cooperation opportunities for Turkey around the world.
We will further increase the number of our embassies in Africa, which we have increased from 12 to 39 in the past five years.
As a result of our efforts to enable Turkish companies and businessmen to become active in the African market and increase their market share, we will strive to increase our total trade volume, which has exceeded 20 billion dollars, even higher.
We will also maintain the helping hand we have extended to this region through development assistance and humanitarian aid, particularly in Somalia.
We will continue to deepen and develop relations with the Asia-Pacific region.
We aim to carry our relations with China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, which we have raised to a strategic level in the past period, to an even higher level.
We will continue to contribute to the stability of Afghanistan and Pakistan, with whom we have historical relations of friendship and brotherhood, and we will try to strengthen our relations with India, one of the major political and economic powers of Southeast Asia.
Within the framework of our policy of reaching out to new geographies, our trade volume with Latin America and the Caribbean, another region with which we have strengthened our commercial and diplomatic ties, has increased 9-fold in the last decade and reached 8 billion dollars.
We will maintain this approach and continue to develop our relations on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.
As a result of the active foreign policy pursued by the Justice and Development Party, Turkey today is an actor capable of effective planning at all levels, from local to national, national to regional, regional to global, and of putting forward long-term and inclusive perspectives, and of asserting its growing capabilities and capabilities.
We will further strengthen this position in the coming period.
We will strengthen the institutional structure in the field of foreign economic relations and redefine the powers and responsibilities of institutions operating in this field.
In cooperation with civil society, we will strengthen our educational and cultural activities abroad in a much more systematic way.
6.2. Contribution to the Global Development Agenda and Humanitarian Diplomacy
As the Justice and Development Party, we want to increase prosperity not only for our own nation, but for all humanity.
We support the fight against hunger, poverty, conflicts, disasters and other global challenges, starting with our immediate neighborhood, regardless of race, religion, language or origin.
With this understanding, we consider it among the main priorities of our foreign policy to help all people, especially those living in the least developed and underdeveloped countries, who strive for a share of global prosperity, and to share our development experience with them.
a. What Have We Done?
As AK Party, we see foreign policy as one of the most important building blocks of our goal of a strong and respected Turkey.
While building a stable and growing Turkey in the economy, we are also taking historic steps towards democratization, human rights and establishing a credible foreign policy.
We have made and continue to make significant contributions to the global development and humanitarian diplomacy agenda, which is a core part of our foreign policy.
We increased the number of TIKA's Program Coordination Offices (PCOs) from 12 in 2002 to 49 in 47 countries as of 2015.
We increased the number of countries where TIKA operates from 20 in 2002 to 140 in 2015.
We have significantly increased our official development assistance.
We increased our Official Development Assistance (ODA) from USD 85 million in 2002 to USD 3.5 billion by the end of 2014.
In addition to public sector aid activities, we increased Total Development Assistance (TDA) to $6 billion in 2014, including foreign investments by the private sector and the activities of civil society organizations.
We provide "temporary protection" to Syrians fleeing war and oppression within the framework of international law.
We have been implementing an "open door" policy for Syrians since April 2011.
Today, the number of Syrian refugees we host in our country has exceeded 2 million. Syrians in our country benefit from all basic aid and health services.
In fact, our country has not received the expected support from economically developed countries and international institutions on the issue of refugees, for which the entire international community should assume responsibility.
We also provided basic aid and health services to 200,000 Iraqis, including 40,000 Yazidis, who took refuge in our country from Iraq as a result of DAESH attacks.
Somalia is one of the best examples of the humanitarian diplomacy we are pursuing.
The visit of our President when he was Prime Minister was a milestone for Somalia's recovery and drew the attention of the international community to the region.
b. What will we do?
In the coming period, we will give our development cooperation policy a strategic framework.
By strengthening our financial, human and institutional capacity and legal infrastructure for development cooperation, we will ensure that these opportunities are used to increase our social welfare.
We will continue to work towards raising awareness of international cooperation in Turkey and strengthening cultural cooperation between Turkey and partner countries.
We will implement our "Priority Transformation Program on Enhancing International Cooperation for Development" in order to improve the institutional and human capacity of public institutions, private sector and NGOs in the field of international cooperation, raise the awareness of national and international public opinion, and make Turkey a regional hub for international development cooperation organizations.
Under the program, we will prepare the Basic Policy and Strategy Document on Development Cooperation and the Foreign Aid Law.
We will prepare a comprehensive review of Turkey's development cooperation.
We will accredit civil society organizations operating in the field of development cooperation and support them to become international centers.
We will launch "Knowledge and Experience Sharing Programs" in specific areas where Turkey has expertise.
We will support international mobility and cooperation in education.
We will provide trainings to raise global awareness in primary and secondary education.
We will prepare a Communication Strategy with the Global Community.
We will establish international development cooperation research centers and graduate programs at universities.
We will launch a program on the effectiveness of foreign language education in educational institutions.
We will establish international student offices in universities and improve legislation for international students.
We will increase scholarship opportunities for students and academics from LDCs in our universities in priority areas of development need.
We will strengthen the external relations units of public institutions in terms of budget, human resources and institutional capacity.
We will create "Foreign Relations Specialist" positions in public institutions.
We will increase the number of Turkish expert staff in international organizations.
We will review the specialized units in missions abroad and ensure that appointments to these units are based on merit.
We will review and strengthen Turkey's emergency and humanitarian assistance capacity.
Within the framework of our chairmanship of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, we will host the Annual Summit on Migration and Development in October 2015.
6.3. Regional and International Cooperation
As a respected member of the international community, it is one of the most important priorities of our Party in foreign policy to strengthen cooperation in the region and globally with the perspective of increasing both human development and economic welfare.
As AK Party, we believe that the geographical and cultural heritage we inherited from the past should be considered as a strong ground for our foreign policy.
We aim to increase the effectiveness of our country in multinational platforms, especially in structures such as the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
By taking an active role in important mechanisms such as the UN and the G-20, we strongly put forward our country's priorities and perspective on global issues.
a. What Have We Done?
Since we came to power in 2002, we have been conducting a constructive diplomacy that aims to mobilize regional cooperation dynamics and effectively use multilateral diplomacy tools.
To date, we have implemented the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSC) mechanism, a unique cooperation development model, with a total of 19 countries.
We signed 431 documents with these countries in 36 joint cabinet meetings held at the level of Heads of State/Government.
As a result of our foreign policy successes and multilateral relations, we diversified our foreign trade markets and achieved significant increases in our exports and international investments.
From the perspective of facilitating our trade relations, we have abolished visa practices or provided visa facilities with many countries.
We have developed solutions to the problems faced by our companies in the fields of transportation and logistics and have worked to create alternative transportation corridors.
As a result of our efforts, our relations with countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus, South Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region are gradually developing.
In the 19-country Middle East and North Africa basin, we increased our exports nine-fold from $5.2 billion to $45.1 billion.
Our total trade volume with this basin has increased from 8 billion dollars to 69 billion dollars.
The total value of Turkish contractors' projects in the Middle East alone reached 78.6 billion dollars by the end of March 2015.
From 2005 to the end of 2014, we increased our exports to European countries excluding the EU from 14.3 billion dollars to 34 billion dollars.
We have increased our total trade volume in this basin from 55 billion dollars to 112 billion dollars.
While developing our trade and political relations with other regions, we have not neglected our European Union membership perspective, which we see as a strategic goal.
We considered the accession negotiations with the EU as an important trigger for our reform process.
The legal and administrative arrangements we have realized in this context are the best examples of our government's determined stance on political reforms.
We started accession negotiations to the European Union in 2005.
In this context, 14 out of 35 chapters have been opened for negotiations.
Many negotiating chapters were ready to be opened or temporarily closed, but progress was blocked by internal EU issues and the political considerations of some member states.
Our government continued to pursue with determination the reforms it deemed important for our people and continued its efforts to build a positive agenda with the EU.
As a concrete example of this, in 2013 we took a historic step and officially launched the Visa Waiver Dialogue, which will allow our citizens to travel visa-free to Schengen countries within 3-3.5 years.
We have developed many regional initiatives within the framework of our country's approach to create a belt of peace, stability and prosperity in the geography at its center;
The Iraq Neighboring Countries Process (2003-2008), which we launched in January 2003 against the risk of war and demonstrated a common will for regional stability,
The Turkey-Afghanistan-Pakistan Trilateral Summit Process (since 2007), which we initiated to contribute to building mutual trust,
Turkey-Bosnia and Herzegovina-Serbia Trilateral Cooperation Mechanism (since 2009), which we launched to consolidate peace, stability and prosperity in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to contribute to the stabilization environment in the Balkans,
Turkey-Bosnia-Herzegovina-Croatia Trilateral Cooperation Mechanism (since 2010), which we launched to contribute to good neighborliness and regional cooperation in the Balkans,
Istanbul Process (since 2011) with the participation of 14 regional countries, external supporters, national and international organizations to contribute to peace and stability in Afghanistan and the wider region,
Turkey-Iran-Azerbaijan Trilateral Mechanism established to enhance cooperation in addressing regional issues (since 2011),
Turkey-Georgia-Azerbaijan Trilateral Mechanism (since 2012), which aims to establish comprehensive cooperation in the South Caucasus,

The Friends of the Syrian People Group, which Turkey led in 2012 to promote efforts to resolve the conflict in line with the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,
The Trilateral Solidarity in Peacebuilding process (since 2013), initiated with Sweden and Brazil to exchange views in a flexible, non-institutionalized format on issues on the international agenda,
Within the framework of multilateral cooperation efforts within the Turkic world, the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic Speaking States (TURKPA) was established in 2008 and the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States (Turkic Council) in 2009.
As a reflection of the increasing weight of our country, we have assumed rotating presidencies in many international and regional organizations of which we are a member and hosted important summits of these organizations.
In recent years, our relations with Islamic countries have gained significant momentum.
The share of Islamic countries in our exports increased rapidly, reaching 32 percent in 2014.
In the 2002-2014 period, we significantly increased the effectiveness of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation among Islamic Countries (COMCEC).
In 2004, we organized an economic conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the COMCEC and in 2009, we organized the COMCEC Economic Summit to mark its 25th anniversary.
In 2014, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the COMCEC by organizing a series of side events.
In 2012, the COMCEC Strategy, designed for the first time exclusively as a vision document for the COMCEC, was adopted at the 4th Extraordinary Islamic Summit.
The 6 working groups established with the strategy aim to share knowledge and experience, build a consensus and converge policies among member countries.
Through the COMCEC Project Financing mechanism, project support was provided to 8 member countries and OIC organizations in 2014.
Directly and indirectly, 22 Member States have benefited from these projects.
Again in 2015, project support is provided to 14 countries and OIC organizations.
Within the scope of these projects, 24 member states will benefit directly or indirectly.
The necessary conditions for the realization of the Preferential Trade System among the OIC Member Countries (TPS-OIC), one of the most important projects of the COMCEC for increasing intra-OIC trade, were completed by the end of 2014.
The Standards and Metrology Institute for Islamic Countries (SMIIC), the establishment of which was decided under the umbrella of COMCEC, started its activities in 2010 in Istanbul, hosted by Turkey.
Currently, 32 out of 57 OIC members have joined SMIIC.
The OIC Member States Stock Exchanges Forum was established in 2005.
The secretariat services of the Forum are provided by Borsa Istanbul and 50 companies from 19 OIC member countries are included in the OIC/ISEDAK index, which is a concrete output.
The 4th United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) was hosted by Turkey in Istanbul in 2011.
By 2020, the Istanbul Action Program, which includes activities to be implemented for the development of LDCs, was adopted.
A comprehensive Economic and Technical Cooperation Package for LDCs was announced.
The Package envisages an annual allocation of $200 million, starting in 2012, for economic and technical cooperation programs and projects for LDCs.
Our development assistance to LDCs has exceeded our commitments in this package, with projects for LDCs totaling $286 million and $210 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
We attach great importance to the G-20, which has recently grown in influence and become one of the building blocks of global economic governance.
Turkey was elected to the G-20 presidency, first as part of the G-20 Troika and then assumed the G-20 presidency for a one-year term at the end of 2014.
Our quota at the IMF was increased and Turkey was given the position of Executive Director for the first time.
Thus, our country has moved from being a country implementing IMF programs to being a decision-making country in the IMF.
Similarly, Turkey's voting power increased from 0.53 percent to 1.08 percent as a result of the capital increase within the scope of the reform efforts initiated in 2008 to improve its representation and participation in the World Bank.
b. What We Will Do
Deepening our relations with Europe and the Transatlantic institutions, which constitute the main anchor of our foreign policy in terms of politics, economy and defense, will continue to be one of our top priorities, as it was in our previous governments.
We remain determined to further advance our country's strategic goal of membership of the European Union, a reform process that will contribute to raising the living standards of our people.
We will continue our efforts to overcome politically-induced bottlenecks in the EU accession process and to revitalize accession negotiations by opening new chapters.
The Visa Exemption Dialogue process, which was initiated in 2013 as a result of our recent intensive contacts with the EU Commission in a mutually constructive manner to find a mutually acceptable solution on visa exemption, will be completed.
Continuation of EU accession negotiations and harmonization with the acquis, effective utilization of pre-accession financial assistance and implementation of Turkey's new EU communication strategy will be among our priority objectives.
In addition to the EU, we will continue to consolidate and deepen our relations with regions that were considered distant geographies in the past.
Our country is peace on a global scale,
will actively contribute and participate in efforts to contribute to stability, cultural cohesion and prosperity.
We will continue to support efforts to further strengthen the military and political effectiveness of NATO, which is at the center of our security and defense policy.
In the coming period, we aim to initiate studies and negotiations on the addition of "trade in services and investment" chapters to the existing FTAs signed between Turkey and the countries in the region.
We will complete the necessary analysis for new FTAs, including provisions on trade in services and investments.
We will enact a law specific to the COMCEC in order to carry out the Secretariat services of the COMCEC more effectively.
We will continue to play a leading role in the realization of the Preferential Trade System among OIC Member Countries (TPS-OIC), an important COMCEC project.
Based on our approach to create a belt of prosperity and stability in our immediate neighborhood, we will continue to take steps to leave behind problems and find common solutions with all countries, especially our neighbors.
We will increase the number of diplomatic missions around the world, especially in Africa.
We will continue to lead initiatives such as the "Alliance of Civilizations" and "Mediation for Peace", which we have played an important role in launching at the UN.
As part of our new visionary foreign policy, Turkey will host the OIC Summit in 2016.
