FROM MIND T UT ULING TO SMART STATE
For more than twelve years, Turkey has been governed by governments formed by a political party in sole power.
During this time, instead of being used for justice, peace and prosperity, the nation's will has been wasted on tension, polarization and conflict,
"National will" corruption,
injustice
and made a cover for separatism.
Today's Turkey is a bloc in which our national and spiritual values are being destroyed,
terror is rampant,
where separatism finds courage,
unemployment and poverty are on the rise,
Corruption
and injustice is at its peak,
education has lost its nationality,
Turkey has been discredited in the international community,
It is a bloc of destruction and defeat in which citizens are overwhelmed by the burden of debt.
Turkey has been reduced to the ignominy of being a subcontractor of imperialist projects, especially the Greater Middle East Project, and has been made a partner in blood, tears and massacres under the rule of AKP governments that seek legitimacy from other quarters and lack merit and foresight.
In recent years, one development after another has undermined Turkey's ideal of living forever as one nation and one state.
Especially the separatist movements have gained more power than ever before,
The issue of terrorism has also been turned into an identity issue through policies of political appeasement,
The acceptance and response to separatist demands disguised in pseudo-democratic rhetoric, and the increase in social and political pressure on Turkey are some of them.
AKP administrations, lacking a sense of national identity and national history, have created a favorable environment for the systematic project of liquidating the Turkish nation.
By constantly referring to 36 ethnic groups, ethnic separatism has been highlighted and
sectarianism has been fomented with an otherizing language.
The failure to understand the distinction between "political/legal" identity and "ethnic/cultural identity" has led to the failure to understand the difference between "humanitarian demand for rights" and "ethnic/separatist demand for privileges", which in turn has led to the acceleration of separatism.
The "state of being a nation" has thus been subjected to a total and organized attack.
Efforts have been made to eviscerate the splendor that the name "Turk" evokes in the minds of people all over the world, and in this framework, the inclusive, encompassing, majestic quality of the word "Turk", which refers to a civilization for at least a thousand years, has been harmed by pronouncing it together with the large and small ethnic groups residing in Anatolia.
While the universal framework to which the name and definition of "Turk" corresponds was being weakened in this way, and the emotional affinity of our citizens with this definition was being dried up and their contact with it was being cut off, simultaneously the
efforts to nationalize an ethnic group and to isolate it from the cultural basin to which it belongs and to feed it to imperialism gained momentum.
Many legal and administrative regulations made in parallel with the opening process have been shaped with an ethnicity-centered understanding that emphasizes differences and discrimination, and the legal processes being carried out in this context have gradually drifted into a nature that challenges the unitary structure of Turkey.
The negotiation process with separatist terrorism has neither led to the PKK coming down from the mountain and laying down arms, nor has it strengthened the will to live together.
Our unity has been undermined and Turkey has been weakened by the actions of a government that has only progressed in a cycle of compromise and surrender.
Roadblocks, burning, demolitions, kidnappings, bombings and massacres continue.
PKK terrorism continues to threaten Turkey's survival, citizens' security of life and property, peace and prosperity.
This result shows that the AKP's "opening policy" is bankrupt and that the MHP is right once again.
In our view, a new approach should be developed in the fight against separatist terrorism, which threatens the survival of the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish nation.
The practice of confining security forces to their barracks and outposts with a defensive approach
and implicit and/or explicit negotiations with the terrorist organization must be ended immediately.
In line with the fact that the solution to the problem of separatist terrorism depends primarily on the neutralization of terrorist elements, the approach of seeking help from certain political figures who are themselves under threat from the terrorist organization should be abandoned.
Simultaneously, measures must be implemented to eliminate the economic and social causes exploited by terrorist elements.
The establishment of national unity and solidarity will only be possible through an understanding of a nation built on common values and past and a
common march towards the future.
The great turmoil and upheaval in the Middle East negatively affects Turkey due to its historical and cultural ties as well as its natural proximity to the region.
At the same time, the foreign policy approach monopolized by a narrow circle of bureaucracy and shaped on the axis of personal egos has gained a nature that will complicate Turkey's work and narrow its room for maneuver not only in the Middle East but also in other regions.
Turkey is also becoming increasingly fragile in terms of macroeconomic aggregates.
If the necessary measures are not taken, these vulnerabilities could have devastating consequences for the Turkish people.
Based on hot money flows and consuming rather than producing,
information and technology intensive,
investments in the service sector instead of competitive investments
and rent-seeking approaches are not only unsustainable, but also pose a significant risk factor for the future of Turkey's economy.
Countries with a highly competitive, productive and dynamic economy are able to play a greater role in regional and global politics.
Turkey's achievement of such a healthy economic order will be one of the most important issues that will affect the shaping of the coming years.
Unemployment,
poverty,
inequality in income distribution,
distortions in the education system,
inadequacies in the social security system
, corruption and corruption in all areas are the main socio-economic problems facing Turkey and have deep-rooted roots.
The political climate in Turkey has become harsher, political discourse has at times been of a vulgar nature, the culture of reconciliation has weakened, polarization has been fomented and the law of comity has been wounded.
The biggest corruption and bribery incidents in our recent political history, allegedly perpetrated by members of the government, and the cover-up of these allegations by using the power of the government, which were revealed on December 17-25, have led to the undermining of and loss of faith in the principles of rights, justice, equality and legitimacy, which are most needed for social peace, peaceful coexistence and trust, and caused people to give up hope in legitimate mechanisms in the pursuit of justice.
Against this backdrop, Turkey needs to put aside the debates that have been going on for almost a century, many of which have no social relevance, and focus its energies on building a prosperous country.
and the creation of a new Turkish civilization armed with high values.
Turkey's inability to establish itself on a healthy basis economically, socially and politically
and to reach the standards of developed modern democratic countries stems from the
lack of a civilization project, the main framework of which has been drawn, the details of which have been thought through, and which the state and the nation have jointly adopted as a road map for the future.
Within this framework, first and foremost, a consensus must be reached at the highest level, especially among political parties, that the Turkish nation is not a derivative people.
The blunder of classifying the Turkish nation according to ethnic groups must be abandoned immediately.
That Turkey is not just the name of a country, but the name of a glorious civilization and the lands that harbor the legacy of a rich Turkish-Islamic tradition;
It should also not be forgotten that these toasts are a symbol for new encounters and reconciliations in the non-western world.
In our view, making the spirit and roots of Turkish-Islamic civilization the starting point for a new beginning today will not only lift Turkey out of the confusion and vicious circle it is in, but will also be a beacon of hope for oppressed nations.
A new march of civilization to be initiated by the Turkish nation will draw its spiritual climate from Turkish-Islamic sources and its cultural foundations from our ancient religions.
This march will first and foremost make Turkey self-reliant, standing on its own strength,
head held high, belly full
and to make it an honorable country where free people live.
It is a human-centered march that aims to humanize the increasingly ruthless phenomenon of globalization, reduce injustice and increase solidarity among nations.
The Turkish nation has vast historical experience and cultural depth,
It has the possibility and potential to create a new synthesis by adding universal achievements equipped with democratic principles.
The realization of this understanding requires "uninterrupted full democracy", which will pave the way for the integration of politics with society at all levels, and the liquidation of anti-democratic, non-national rules, institutions and structures that lead to the alienation of the state from society, history and national identity, as well as the
creation of rules, institutions and structures that will enable Turkey to break through its own mists and achieve the power to deliver civilization-building values to oppressed nations.
The Nationalist Movement Party, which draws its strength from the Constitution, its beliefs, its principles and the Turkish nation, claims to both build and represent the "social center" in politics.
The Nationalist Movement Party reinforces this claim with a political language that is reconciliatory rather than confrontational, integrative rather than divisive, peaceful rather than quarrelsome, embracing rather than marginalizing, unifying rather than dividing, nurturing peace rather than chaos, and demonstrating the will to carry Turkey and the Turkish nation into the future together.
The "free individual" by ensuring the widest use of individual rights,
strong industry
strong economy,
strong democracy
investment with
production
and "müre ffeh to plumu" by increasing employment;
together with national unity and integrity,
effective foreign policy,
establishment of deterrent armed forces
with the construction of a "strong state";
human rights at the global level,
justice
and by emphasizing sustainable development
It envisions the realization of a "more humane world".
Shaping its national and universal policies on the axis of these fundamental principles and principles, MHP will solve the problems of our country,
He stands before our nation with projects that will make Turkey a respected, respected and developed country in the world.
The main project areas have been identified as follows:  State and Governance Reform in Social Reparation Process
 Producing Economy Program
 Fighting Poverty Project
 Fight against Terrorism and National Unity Project
 Addressing the Fight against Corruption, Establishing Morality and Quality Project
Ending the "mindlessness" that has been going on in Turkey for a long time
and strengthening the will to live together with a social consensus
These main projects and the sub-projects that regulate their implementation have been developed in order to create a state mindset that respects its citizens instead of despising them.
In addition, a "Priority Action Plan (PAP)" was prepared for Turkey's urgent problems that need to be addressed immediately, and the process for their resolution was timetabled.
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE AGE
The first years of the 21st century have been years in which some traditional alliances have disintegrated with the winds of globalization, developing technology has been decisive on the way of producing, consuming, governing and living, global capital has reached borderless mobility and efforts to reshape the world order on the axis of multidimensional partnerships have continued.
However, more democracy,
human rights,
justice,
peace and
increased prosperity were expected.
Although globalization is supposed to promote the spread and development of democracy on the grounds of the common prosperity and happiness of humanity,
the supremacy of the rule of law,
Although this process is said to offer opportunities in terms of securing fundamental rights and freedoms;
international terrorism,
immigration,
ethnic conflicts,
civil unrest,
regional conflicts,
double standards contrary to international law,
hunger and impoverishment,
the growing gap between rich countries and poor countries,
violations of law in the name of democracy,
environmental disasters, and so on.
Some forces have sought to expand their own networks of privilege by trying to ignore or eliminate as much as possible the national and humanitarian sensitivities and rules that stand in their way in this process.
In doing so, they have used non-governmental civil society organizations, ethnic and religious elements as the most important tools or actors of cooperation in the targeted countries by claiming to be the flagship of "human rights".
With the superiority provided by technological and economic dominance, they have tended to threaten the national state structure by scratching ethnic identities and weakening national identity.
In the face of global aggression, societies whose minimum commonalities have weakened, who have been unable to form a harmonious social cohesion, and who have been unable to produce common decisions and solutions, have faced the loss of their national strongholds of resistance one by one in this process.
Especially in regions of ethnic and religious fragility, public order has been disrupted and a chaotic environment has been created, fueling the formation of fragmented structures with multiple identities, multiple cultures, multiple languages and multiple laws.
Unfortunately, Turkey, which is at the center of conflicts, chaos and turmoil due to its geo-political position, has entered this period seeking its legitimacy from the imperialist powers that seek to establish sovereignty in the region where the conflicts are taking place;
The AKP governments were led by cadres who emphasized politics without foresight, without will, without identity and without personality.
Under the leadership of a Prime Minister who is the co-chair of the Greater Middle East Project, Turkey has attempted to play a role in the process of reshaping the Middle East with the promise of "democracy" and has become a partner in the conflict, oppression, blood, tears and deaths of millions of Muslims.
However, the rule of law is only possible in a democracy that has not been instrumentalized.
and clean politics.
In a political and social environment where democracy is instrumentalized, democracy-specific values will not go further than a discourse without content.
As a result of policies that are shortsighted, far from reality and shaped according to the priorities of other countries, Turkey has ceased to be a country to be listened to in the world and has
been reduced to a completely ineffective position, unable to be decisive in any development in its immediate geography.
Aware of the threat these developments pose to the world and to Turkey, which is located in the most strategic region of the world, the Nationalist Movement Party, in the past forty-six years that it has been in the political arena, has demonstrated its decisive stance by seeing the developments that threaten Turkey and humanity at a time when no one could perceive them yet, and today it sees the fate to which the global threat is dragging our country, our region and humanity and develops national attitudes and policies against it.
From this point of view, our Party believes that the process of globalization can be put into a humanitarian context and transformed into a movement for justice on a global scale; The
use of the world's blessings and technological opportunities to serve the common future of all humanity, guaranteeing
the fundamental rights and freedoms of people,
mutual respect instead of the seeds of hatred and resentment that are being sown between cultures and civilizations, cooperation based on tolerance and understanding, the eradication of
hunger and poverty, a
common position on the fight against terrorism, the
It believes that women's and children's rights and a livable environment are only possible if we stand up for them.
The ideal of a world in which the Turkish nation and all humanity will live in peace and happiness can only be realized through the realization of a new civilization project centered in Turkey.
Turkey will become the main axis and center of attraction for the Turkish and Islamic world if it becomes an effective and powerful country on a global scale by integrating its opportunities and capabilities with universal values.
Under the leadership of the MHP, Turkey will take care of its national existence and its historical mission and will get rid of the inertia it is in today; it will
With its riches, deep-rooted state experience and dignified stance, it will go beyond being a regional power and become a global playmaker.
"GLOBAL POWER TURKEY" VISION
The MHP's vision of "Global Power Turkey" is a vision based on a realistic assessment of our country's capabilities and potential.
Under the sole power of the Nationalist Movement Party, history and cultural accumulation,
geo-strategic position,
Turkey will become a regional and global power center and a "Leader Country" with its natural and human resources as well as its capabilities and resources, by seizing opportunities, eliminating threats and utilizing opportunities.
In order to realize Turkey's goal of becoming a leading country in the 21st century, it will be ensured that all social segments have the determination and resolve to walk together into the future with a common understanding and solidarity on the axis of common values such as history, religion and culture.
Social reconciliation on the axis of fundamental national and humanitarian values, national ideals and goals will make it possible for Turkey to reach a consensus on fundamental issues and facilitate the implementation of future plans and programs in cooperation.
Economic growth amid political stability,
social development
and national integration, Turkey will become one of the major actors in the community of nations in political, military, economic and social terms.
Turkey will take the necessary institutional, legal and political steps and ensure their realization by taking the initiative for the formation of effective partnerships based on economic and political cooperation in the region.
Countries that will take part in the cooperation projects to be built under Turkey's leadership; raising democratic standards,
Increasing the reimbursement rate,
guaranteeing human rights and freedoms,
to make justice prevail,
peace and tranquility,
will be strengthened by eradicating poverty.
The realization of the vision of "2023 Leading Country Turkey", which the Nationalist Movement introduced into the political agenda in the 1990s and presented to the public as a project in 1999, and which was included in the Eighth Development Plan in 200 1 and turned into a state policy, and which aims to make Turkey a leading country in the world on the centenary of the founding of our Republic, has been hindered by the inadequate performance of the AKP governments that have been in power for more than 12 years, and the envisaged goals have been far from being realized.
Eight years before 2023, Turkey's prestige in the world has diminished and its
ability to be decisive in its region has been lost.
For this reason, in the two eight-year periods until 2023, the MHP government will ensure that the time lost, the damage done and the deficit caused by the AKP will be eliminated.
20 Following the "Repair, Integration and Breakthrough" period between 15-20 19, Turkey will become a regional power and a global actor in 2023,
By 2053, the economy will be in
social,
politics,
technological
and will become an effective power and a leading country on a global scale in strategic areas and will make this sustainable.
The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) comes before the public with short, medium and long term goals to make Turkey a global power and a leading country.
Our short-term goal is to be in power alone,
Until the end of the first period of government, covering the years 20 15-20 19, we demanded the restoration of Turkey, which had been destroyed, and the unification of the nation, which had been dissolved,
d emocracy to be strengthened;
econ omics
political,
social
and technological breakthroughs to bring Turkey out of the vicious circle it has fallen into and to ensure that it makes a leap forward.
Our medium-term goal is for Turkey to become a regional power, to overcome political and social problems and to have a voice on a global scale by 2023, at the end of the second term of government covering the years 20 19-2023.
Our long-term strategy is to ensure that Turkey becomes a "Global Power and Leader Country" by 2053.
The MHP has adopted the concept of establishing a new civilization and a new world centered on Turkey as its political mission.
This mission will not only make Turkey a leading country,
but will also help all oppressed nations, especially those in Eurasia, to live in freedom and dignity.
The condition for achieving this is, first and foremost, for Turkey to get rid of capitulationism
and to turn towards the values that represent the essence of the Turkish nation.
It is at peace with its national and historical values,
It has established an effective state order that is capable of solving problems and has a high capacity for policy-making,
implemented an economic model that would mobilize resources for production.
and a strong Turkey that has achieved a respected position in the global system will put its stamp on world politics and economic life in the 21st century.
In the eight-year period between 20 15-2023, the MHP is determined to build a Turkey that has become a regional power and a global actor.
As a requirement of this, it aspires to power alone and comes before the Turkish nation with programs and projects to achieve this goal.
First Period of Power: The Period of "Repair, Integration and Breakthrough" from 20 15-20 19
In this period, the institutions and rules required for a state and society in modern conditions, which Turkey needs to become a global power, will be established.
However, the AKP governments are anti-democratic, tutelary, nepotistic, favoritist and lawless,
violating personal safety,
All kinds of works, transactions, rules and institutions that restrict freedoms will be addressed in all their elements and the corrupt order will be put an end to.
Any damage caused by the AKP on the institutions of the state, our national and spiritual values and citizens will be repaired, the
requirements of the principle of separation of powers will be established, and
traumas such as fear and suspicion will be removed from the society.
This period will be a period in which the divisions and polarization between our citizens are eliminated, the
state and the nation, democracy and the republic are brought together, the
It will be a period in which the crisis of trust between institutions and citizens is eliminated and trust is established in every field.
In this period when reconciliation will be established among all segments of society and actors, the "management style" will be the main dynamics of reconciliation, along with legal and administrative measures.

new economic and political initiatives will be taken towards the region
and priority will be given to repairing the deteriorated relations with the countries of the region in this period.
By demonstrating its "desire to live together" with all its citizens, Turkey will succeed in redirecting the energy spent on internal struggles towards the development of the country.
In the process in which technology-intensive, high value-added investments begin to turn into production, domestic and foreign potential will be mobilized in strategic sectors such as energy, and supply security will be fully ensured.
The last year of the "Repair, Integration and Breakthrough" period, which covers the years 20 15-20 19, will be a period in which the moves made since 20 15 will bear fruit, Turkey will make a leap in all respects, the democratic, economic, social and technological vicious circle will be broken, and the infrastructure for the 2023 goals will be completed.
In the first period of the government, which will mainly cover the years 20 16-20 19, the average annual growth rate will be 5.2 percent

By the end of the period, GDP will reach 1.1 trillion dollars, national income per capita will reach 13.3 thousand dollars, and exports will reach 239 billion dollars
and employment will reach approximately 29.1 million people.
The employment rate, which was 4 5.5 percent in 20 14, will increase to 47.8 percent at the end of the period.
Second Period of Power: "Regional Power, Global Actor Turkey" Period Covering 20 19-202 3
20 The MHP government covering the years 19-2023 will be the period of Turkey's becoming a regional power and global actor and achieving the vision of 2023.
The main objective of the political vision of "Turkey as a Leader Country in 2023", which we set out years ago as a long-term strategic goal, is to ensure that our country has the ability to perceive and assess the contemporary world in Turkish,
effective at the global level
and to be elevated to the position of a "leading country", one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of economy.
Although the policies put forward by the MHP within the framework of the 2023 vision were developed by taking into account the realities of Turkey and the world, and are achievable goals, Turkey has fallen far behind these goals in the twelve years of AKP rule.
However, it is not too late to mobilize the resources of our country in line with the "2023 development goals".
The MHP has the experience and equipment to mobilize this potential.
Despite the AKP's twelve years of destruction, the first period of MHP rule from 20 15 to 20 19 and then the second period of MHP rule from 20 19 to 20 23 will enable Turkey to become a "regional power and global actor" in 2023.
20 In the MHP government for the period of 19-2023, resources will be mobilized and resources will be invested in a high value-added economy that uses advanced technology.
and creating jobs,

In the period until 2023, Turkey will make serious breakthroughs in the fields of materials technology, biotechnology and information technology and gain technological competitiveness.
It enables the improvement of human living standards,
raising the level of wages,
Technologies that ensure quality production will be put into practice.

, and the enrollment rate in formal higher education will be increased to 75 percent.
The number of full-time researchers per thousand inhabitants will be increased to 3, and the
ratio of R&D expenditures to GDP will be raised above 3 percent.
The fundamental rights and freedoms of the human being will be indisputably guaranteed, the
supremacy of law will be fully established
, and no international political project in which Turkey is involved will be allowed to violate these rights.
It was also a period when our country's prestige in the community of nations increased,
It will be a period in which citizenship awareness is developed and everyone is proud to be a Turkish citizen.
All our citizens will believe in the dignity of living in such a country and no one will give credence to efforts to use differences as an element of division and separation.
After the period of "Repair, Integration and Breakthrough" that started in 20 15, the mobilization of existing resources, opportunities and capabilities with a strategic vision; the
strengthening of citizenship consciousness;
integration on the axis of common values rooted in history and faith; and having
a say in decision-making processes on a global scale will be realized at the end of the eight-year period that will pass under the sole rule of MHP.

GDP will rise to $1.7 trillion, per capita income to $20,000, exports to $400 billion and employment to 33.2 million.

OUR UNDERSTANDING OF POWER, FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS AND GOALS
We see politics as a way of developing policies to ensure the peace and prosperity of the nation, and
for this purpose, we envisage that state services should be provided in accordance with the expectations of citizens and that its institutions and rules should be shaped according to this understanding.
Democracy, the regime in which the nation is best represented in state administration;
the supremacy of law,
as a system in which human rights and freedoms are guaranteed in the broadest sense
and we believe in the vital importance of the institutionalization of democracy.
Our Party, which conducts politics with an understanding that prioritizes democratic political culture, reconciliation and responsibility, will continue to pioneer this understanding to dominate Turkish political life.
We see an understanding of secularism that respects the beliefs of citizens and is based on freedom of religion and conscience as a guarantee of national unity and integrity.
Our understanding of nationalism, which takes shape by drawing inspiration from the history, culture, traditions and belief world of the Turkish nation, expresses making the existence of the national and spiritual values of the Turkish nation meaningful and sustainable in the line extending from tradition to the future.
We consider it absolutely unacceptable that our millennia-old strong state structure and cultural accumulation are being consumed, polluted, discredited and finally abandoned to the orders of separatist elements and interest gangs with a shortsighted and submissive understanding.
The principle of "live and let live", which constitutes the spiritual basis of our understanding of nationalism, expresses that our religions, which have been filtered through history and are the source of life of our nation, give meaning to our lives in a way that encompasses our whole self, and that this treasure of religions, which is enriched and institutionalized by living, is passed on to future generations.
The Nationalist Movement Party adopts an ethical approach that aims to establish love, tolerance and justice in human relations.
We advocate the implementation of principles and standards that will prevent the tendency towards corruption in order to make this understanding prevail in all segments of society with all its institutions and rules.
We envisage the realization of total development in peace, tranquility and prosperity through the development of a culture of social solidarity and reconciliation.
The importance of justice, merit, equity and institutionalization,
We believe that individual talents can only be transformed into production and value in an institutionalized environment, and that this is only possible in a just society.
We consider the mobilization of our economic and social accumulations for common goals as a guarantee of our national unity and integrity, with an understanding based on the integrative nature of rich common values, instead of the divisiveness of artificial differences based on history, culture and belief.
We consider the supremacy of law as recognizing, accepting and securing the supreme dignity and fundamental rights of human beings, rather than a legality that ensures order within a democratic system.
Starting from the fact that no person or institution can be above the law, we see the law as the guarantee of the fundamental qualities of the Republic and universal values.
We believe that a healthy democracy can only rise on the ground of a political culture adorned with moral values such as tolerance, honesty, integrity, honesty and sincerity
, and we see principled, level-headed and clean politics as the guarantee of democracy.
Preventing the corruption in politics that undermines public trust in democracy and the state;
We argue that it is only possible to make an understanding with national, moral and social sensitivity dominant.
That every human being has fundamental rights and freedoms that are inviolable, inalienable and inalienable;
the sanctity of the authority and freedom to exercise these rights,
We believe that it is indispensable to protect them from all kinds of abuse, to guarantee them and to make them operational.
To realize a fair and equitable distribution of income in order to consolidate social peace and tranquility,
to keep the national sensitivities of society alive,
We envision the development of a culture of solidarity and the promotion of good qualities such as renunciation and sacrifice against selfishness and indifference.
The establishment of a management culture based on efficiency and quality in state services,
We aim to ensure that a transparent, participatory, accountable, protective and coordinating approach and administrative methods that are based on public trust and aim to gain the trust of the public prevail.
Free enterprise is essential, production is encouraged,
It advocates a competitive and equitable economic policy,
In order for Turkish entrepreneurs to have a voice in the world economy, we attach strategic importance to the global competitiveness of Turkish companies and brands.
Rapid creation of an information society infrastructure,
the implementation of policies to enable the production, utilization and export of information and technology
and we aim to raise social awareness in this direction.
In foreign policy, we aim to enrich social, economic and political relations on the basis of political equality, reciprocity and national interests, with the understanding of an effective and respected state.
The Nationalist Movement Party wants to embrace every human being as a sacred being and a trust, and to achieve the goal of "Leading Country Turkey" within an understanding of unity of heart by winning their hearts, love and respect.
Our Party accepts this understanding as a conscientious responsibility that will contribute to peace at home and in the world, and believes that this goal can be achieved more rapidly if the common attitude to be determined for the ideal of carrying Turkey into the future and the desire to realize it find a place in all hearts.
Our Party, which draws its strength from the nation, believes that the main way to serve our country and our citizens, to make peace, tranquility and prosperity prevail in our region and the world, and to realize the ideal of "Turkey as a Global Power and Leader Country" is the political institution within the democratic order, and in line with this goal, it aims to become "Power Alone" by winning the favor of our nation.

OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Understanding democracy
Our Party, which considers democracy not only as a political regime but also as a way of life, as the guarantee of the supremacy of law, human dignity and honor, freedom of opinion, enterprise, religion and conscience, believes in the necessity of the operation of democracy with all its institutions and rules in social and political relations.
We advocate that a national and democratic Constitution should be based on as broad a consensus as possible, should include general protection provisions rather than general restriction provisions and should be based on freedoms.
The nation and the national will
We believe that in parliamentary democracies the nation is the sole holder of sovereignty, that the legitimacy of political powers is based on the national will, and that the place where the national will is manifested is the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
Our Party believes that any external interference in the democratic regime and the constitutional powers of the parliament is illegitimate and unacceptable, and that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey must uphold the founding principles of the state, the common values of the Turkish nation, the peace and prosperity of Turkey, the reputation and powers of the Parliament and the ethics of politics under all circumstances.
The tendency to authoritarianize by using the national will as a cover is incompatible with the understanding of "national will".
Principle of separation of powers
Considering the principle of separation of powers as the source of vitality and life insurance of the democratic state of law, the MHP attaches importance to the most rational distribution of the duties and powers of the legislative, executive and judiciary, which are the three basic functions of the state, and to their harmonious execution.
Our Party believes that the problems of excessive and conflicting powers can be solved by ensuring that everyone acts within the limits of their Constitutional duties and powers,
The constitutional judiciary and the independence of the judiciary with strong guarantees are of vital importance for the democratic regime,
defends that no organ can exercise any power that does not derive its source from the Constitution.
Understanding of politics
That politics is based on a moral foundation,
d emocratic maturity and a culture of consensus,
where divisive language is honed,
We believe that a political understanding that recognizes Turkey's national and spiritual values as the common denominator should prevail.
The Nationalist Movement Party advocates that every political view should have the freedom to become a party and to express, defend and disseminate their views within the constitutional framework and on democratic platforms, provided that they do not target the indivisible integrity of the state with its country and nation and do not consider terrorism and violence as political goals and tools.
Believing that political parties can only be dissolved by the Turkish nation and through the ballot box, the Nationalist Movement Party opposes the dissolution of political parties, except for parties that use terrorism and violence as political goals and tools, and envisages the principle of individual responsibility instead of party dissolution.
We believe that the untouchability of MPs should be based on reasonable principles that the public conscience can accept and that untouchability in matters outside the legislative and oversight activities within the Grand National Assembly of Turkey should be abolished.
Free and independent media
We believe that the press, broadcasting and other means of communication should not be restricted, should not be censored and should be free, provided that they are not contrary to the indivisible integrity of the State with its territory and nation, the fundamental principles of the Republic, national security and public order.
In addition, the development and institutionalization of press and broadcasting ethics, including the right of correction and reply, the right not to violate the dignity and honor of individuals, and the right not to publish untruths,
We consider it necessary to ensure professional oversight and public oversight in this direction.
The Nationalist Movement Party envisages that the media, which is one of the indispensable elements of democracy, should ensure its own self-regulation as well as legal regulations to ensure that it acts in accordance with ethical principles and standards.
We do not reconcile putting the interests of any person or group ahead of the public interest, publishing in the name of journalism in order to mislead, deceive and defame, and acting as the government's lackey instead of auditing on behalf of the public with the democratic structure.
In this context, we believe that basic ethical rules that apply to relations between politics, the media and the business world should be defined and effectively sanctioned.
Promotion of individual freedoms
We consider it necessary to remove obstacles to individual rights and freedoms and to ensure that these rights are exercised in the broadest sense.
We believe that the establishment of a healthy democracy depends on the understanding of the individual and the liberation of the individual.
We believe that in order to pave the way for healthy developments in economic and social life, justice and politics, it is necessary to provide opportunities for individuals with a free mind and a free conscience to grow up.
As MHP, we aim to create a democratic structure and a social and economic order that will ensure that people can exercise their rights arising from being a human being and a citizen, and that everyone has the freedom to stand on their own feet.
Good governance
With an understanding based on citizen satisfaction, our Party considers the closest, fast and effective delivery of public services to the citizen within the framework of the principles of openness, participation and accountability as essential, and
considers providing access to information, legal remedies and the means to seek rights as a requirement of governance close to the citizen.
Within the framework of accountability, we consider it important for the administration to inform the public on a continuous basis in order to establish citizens' trust in the state.
Civil society and participation
In order to strengthen a well-functioning civil society structure in our country, the Nationalist Movement Party envisages the participation of civic organizations in the supervision of public services, in which citizens will take part with the responsibility of being individuals.
It will be essential for civil society organizations to play an effective role in public life, provided that they operate in accordance with the country's legal order, principles, traditions, unitary structure and public order.
By ensuring the development of foundations and civil society organizations and their prominence in public life, it will be ensured that social needs are better met, public oversight is activated and the public is not left behind.
We do not reconcile the basic functions of civil society organizations with the fact that they have abandoned their duty to exercise oversight on behalf of the public and have become political figures, justifying and marketing government practices and supporting the efforts of an ideological group or caste to dominate public resources.
Making ethical rules prevail
A decisive and effective fight against moral pollution and corruption, which threaten the existence of the democratic system and undermine trust in state institutions, is a requirement of our "clean politics-clean governance" approach.
The Nationalist Movement Party considers the fight against corruption as one of the fundamental elements of its political approach.
In this direction, we believe in the urgency of regulations that will actively introduce ethical rules into our daily lives against corruption and corruption in politics and public administration, civil society organizations, media and business world, sports and arts
. In our government, we will effectively fight against this structure that destroys the social fabric.
Guaranteeing fundamental rights
The protection and promotion of the inviolable, inalienable and inalienable fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings, in particular the right to life, is one of the primary duties of the state, and the
recognition and guarantee of these rights and freedoms is the basis of freedom, justice and peace.
We argue that restrictions cannot be imposed on the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, provided that they do not pose a threat to national security, the fundamental characteristics of the Republic, the indivisible integrity of the state with its territory and nation, public order, public morality, public health and the exercise of fundamental rights of others.
Personal inviolability
Our Party strongly opposes all forms of torture and persecution, inhuman and degrading behaviors and practices and
believes that everyone has the right to life, the right to protect and develop his/her material and spiritual existence and that the personal freedom and security of every individual must be ensured and his/her life must be secured.
Freedom of thought and opinion
Our understanding of freedom of thought and opinion is based on the principle that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, opinion, expression of thought and to live as they believe, provided that this freedom does not harm national unity and integrity, public interest and public morality.
Privacy and inviolability of private life
The Nationalist Movement Party believes that the privacy of private and family life cannot be violated and considers the right to demand respect for private and family life as a fundamental human right.
as a fundamental principle that no one's residence can be entered without a duly obtained judge's order in cases determined by law, with the recognition that the inviolability of housing is essential.
We argue that freedom of communication is a fundamental human right and cannot be interfered with or violated.
Freedom of religion and conscience
Everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, religious belief and opinion.
Our understanding of freedom of religion and conscience is based on the principle that freedom of religion and conscience should not be hindered in society and state life, that people should not be condemned, criticized or despised for their beliefs and worship, and that freedom of religion and conscience should not be restricted on any grounds whatsoever.
Right to education and training
Our Party believes that everyone has the right to education and learning and that this right cannot be denied under any circumstances,
believes that education and training should be carried out under the supervision and control of the state.
It is essential that the language of instruction at all levels of education be Turkish.
Right to freedom of association, assembly and demonstration
The Nationalist Movement Party believes that it is essential to exercise the right to organize, assemble and demonstrate in accordance with its essence, provided that it is not contrary to the fundamental principles of the Republic, national security and public order.
Women's and children's rights
Our Party stands against all forms of de facto and de jure discrimination against women and abuse of women, and
considers it necessary to protect children against all forms of rights violations and abuse, including those arising from their families.
Freedom to seek justice and equality before the law
That everyone has the right to a fair trial before a court of law by the use of legitimate means and procedures,
We believe that no action or procedure can be excluded from judicial review.
In accordance with the principle of equality of all before the law, our Party considers it necessary to abolish the inviolability of the Constitution and our laws and to ensure that everyone has the freedom to seek their rights.
Our understanding of a national and democratic constitution
We believe that the Constitution, which we believe to be the ultimate legal basis for the principle of "sovereignty unconditionally belongs to the nation", which is the foundation of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, should enable the establishment and expansion of "sovereignty of the nation", which is the foundation of the national and unitary state.
We see the Constitution as a contract above and beyond politics and time, which will affect not only those living today but also future generations.
Our party believes that the Constitution should include general protection provisions rather than general limitation provisions,
to be based on freedoms
and that it should be in the nature of a "Community Charter".
The Nationalist Movement Party considers it necessary for a constitution in modern standards to be drafted with a broad vision that takes into account the expectations of the entire society, with an understanding that respects different views and opinions, with a search for compromise that will ensure the contribution of everyone, and with ethical methods.
Our priorities in constitution-making:
The Nationalist Movement Party is in favor of constitutional amendments or a new constitution;
 To eliminate anti-democratic practices in the political structure and to achieve a democratic state structure that guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms in areas such as thought, belief, enterprise, organization and similar areas as in modern democracies,
 Our citizens will be proud to be a member of the same nation, torealize the social reconciliation that will ensure integration rather than segregation, embrace rather than differentiation, fusion rather than polarization,
 With a national structure that is not distant from each other and not alienated from each other, ethnic origin, belief, toachieve a social life in which characteristics such as sectarianism are seen as the richness of national identity and millennia of brotherhood.
 To free the state from the cycle of compromise and surrender and become a power that can make independent decisions, have a voice in the world and look at the world through the vision of Ankara as the capital city,
 It emphasizes the realization of respect and observance of the founding principles of the Republic and the principles expressed in the preamble and the first three articles of our Constitution, which define us as a nation and secure our national and unitary existence.
Issues that we will not discuss in any way in the context of constitutional amendments or the drafting of a new constitution:
The Nationalist Movement Party recognizes the fundamental characteristics of the Republic,
Turkish national identity,
democratic regime
and fundamental human rights as indispensable and refuses to discuss them in the search for compromise.
Within a unitary national state based on the principle of one nation-one state,
 Creation of a multipartite nation structure by granting political and legal status to different ethnic identities,
 The transformation of individual rights and freedoms into ethnic-based collective rights,
 Creating artificial minorities by giving status to languages and cultures other than Turkish,
 Preparing the ground for the clash of citizens against each other and the nation against the state,
 To change the definition of national identity and to adopt the concept of "Turkishness",
 Attempts to substitute the bond of citizenship for the concept of the Turkish nation,
 Education in languages other than Turkish as "mother tongue",
 It will not discuss and will oppose any constitutional amendment or a new constitution that would pave the way for the realization of a system of autonomous regions in which local governments would function as local parliaments by changing the administrative structure of Turkey.
We consider the parliamentary system, which is based on the unitary national state structure of the Republic of Turkey, as necessary for the maintenance of a democratic political system and as the most appropriate form of government for the Turkish nation.
We see it as possible to solve the problems arising from the functioning of the system within the parliamentary system.
For this reason, we do not approve of semi-presidential systems, especially the presidency, which would pave the way for a dangerous authoritarianism in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms through the personalization of power, and which aim to create an infrastructure that will lead the state and the nation to different political and administrative structures by depriving the State of the Republic of Turkey of its founding principles.
We reject the political approach that instead of addressing the need for a constitution based on societal necessities, we reject the political approach that would lead the state and the nation to disintegration.
POLICIES

c) Macroeconomic Goals of the Producing Economy Program
Growth, which is expected to remain very low in 20 15 due to wrong economic policies, will gradually increase as of 20 16 and reach 6.1 percent by the end of the first term, thanks to the structural measures to be taken in the climate of confidence and stability that will be created under the MHP government.
Thus, in 20 19, GDP will rise to 1.1 trillion dollars and per capita income to 13.3 thousand dollars.
A balanced growth is targeted both in terms of the contribution of factors of production to growth and in terms of domestic and external demand.
In this framework, on average, a quarter of growth is expected to come from total factor productivity, and exports are expected to make a strong contribution to growth.
In 20 20 19, the labor force participation rate will rise by 2.4 percentage points to 52.9 percent on the back of high growth and reforms, and employment will increase by 2.6 percent on average annually to 29.1 million people.
In the 20 16-20 19 period, an annual average of 700 thousand additional jobs will be created.
Exports, which are expected to decline to USD 155 billion in 20 15, are expected to reach USD 239 billion with an average annual increase of 9.3 percent in real terms, and imports, which decreased significantly in 20 15 due to the crisis environment, are expected to increase at a relatively lower rate and reach USD 388 billion at the end of the period.
In this framework, the current account deficit to GDP ratio is targeted to remain around 5 percent throughout the period, despite the acceleration in growth.
The ratio of domestic savings to GDP will reach 19.4 percent by the end of the period, thanks to the prevention of waste and excessive consumption on the one hand, and high income growth on the other.
The ratio of capital investments to GDP will be increased by 4 percentage points to 24 percent by launching a new investment drive in our country, which has become uninvestable due to uncertainties and instability.
Annual average inflation is targeted to decline gradually to 6 percent by the end of the period.
In public finances, fiscal discipline will not be compromised, the policy of maintaining a reasonable primary surplus will be maintained, and
resources will be generated to implement our policies through reducing informality, preventing corruption and waste, and fair tax increases brought about by the high growth environment.
In this framework, the ratio of the general government structural budget deficit to GDP will be maintained at 2 percent throughout the period.
d) Economic Growth
A high, sustainable and inclusive growth environment will be created, supported by structural reforms
In the growth scenario extending to 2023, the goal is to transition to a high-growth environment by establishing healthy macro conditions on the one hand, and increasing the level of inclusiveness on the other.
To this end, fiscal and monetary policies will be used more strongly in coordination, and these policies will be reinforced by structural reforms, in particular by steps to increase the competitiveness of the economy.
Monetary policy will focus on the goal of permanently bringing inflation down to low levels, while at the same time taking into account economic and financial activity.
In this context, the effectiveness of monetary policy will be enhanced by making it more predictable and inflation will be brought down gradually.
Fiscal policy will focus primarily on improving the quality of revenues and expenditures, stimulating production and ensuring budget flexibility.
Efforts will be made to increase efficiency on both the revenue and expenditure sides without disrupting the budget balance.
On the revenue side, to ensure the allocation of economic resources to productive areas,
to reduce burdens on production
and efforts will be made to make income distribution more equitable.
On the expenditure side, programs for the poor, who need to be protected as a requirement of the social state, will be continued effectively.
In addition, programs to raise the technological level of production in the economy will be initiated
and special emphasis will be given to public infrastructure investments that will support the private sector.
All these policies will pave the way for accelerating economic growth by both increasing production capacity and utilizing it more efficiently.
Structural reforms that will complement strong monetary and fiscal policy will be the key to accelerating growth and improving its quality.
The business and investment climate,
labor market
and rationalized incentive policy will help to
attract foreign direct investment, which in turn will help to rapidly increase investment and channel it into productive areas.
Moreover, the public sector will also support this process with appropriate infrastructure investments.
Thus, the share of capital investments in GDP will be raised to 24 percent in 20 19 and 29 percent in 202 3.
The investment drive and the resulting accelerated growth will increase employment opportunities through reforms to activate the labor market.
On the other hand, in addition to the productivity gains from technological renewal that a high level of new investment would bring,
R&D d es singles,
goal-oriented policies, such as efforts in the energy sector, where our dependence on foreign energy is the highest, will enable a steady increase in productivity across the economy and thus boost our competitiveness.
This policy framework will ensure strong and quality growth.
Growth will be increased to an average of 5.2 percent in 20 16-20 19 and 6.6 percent in 2020-2023.
More importantly, a suitable infrastructure will be created for our economy to continue its growth spurt in a stronger manner after 2023.
A new investment and production drive will be launched in industry
Medium-long term development strategies will be determined and implemented to reduce the development gap with developed countries.

29- FOREIGN POLICY
a) Our Foreign Policy Approach, Basic Principles and Goals
An honorable, prudent, multifaceted, "national interest-oriented" foreign policy will be pursued
Turkey becoming a "Regional Leader Country" that guarantees peace and stability,
In the long term, our Party's foreign policy vision is to become a "Global Power" that will contribute to international security, peace and justice.
Our foreign policy approach is based on a multidimensional foundation that takes into account historical, social and cultural elements, starting from the fact that Turkey is a strong country with a long and deep-rooted state tradition.
Our country's geo-strategic position, the common history and cultural values it shares with countries from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Middle East to Central Asia, and the democratic achievements that form the basis of its relations with the Western world are very important strategic assets.
In order to become a prestigious, influential and decisive power in world politics, Turkey's accumulated experience and all national power resources will be mobilized.
In this context, an honorable, prudent, personal and multifaceted foreign policy will be pursued.
One of the most important elements of the MHP's long term goal of "Global Power Turkey" is to make a multifaceted foreign policy approach dominant and sustainable.
To protect and enhance Turkey's national security and national interests;
to create a belt of peace, stability and security around us;
To establish relations based on mutual respect and mutual benefit with all countries, especially our neighbors;
The main goals of our foreign policy will be to find fair and lasting solutions to existing problems within the framework of international law, while protecting Turkey's rights and interests.
Our Party is in favor of developing a fair and unprejudiced relationship with every state that seeks Turkey's friendship, cooperation and contribution and wants to dialogue and work on equal terms.
Respect for the independence and territorial integrity of states and non-interference in their internal affairs are our fundamental principles in international relations.
These principles will guide our relations, especially with our neighbors.
Turkey will stand by legitimacy
Turkey will stand by international law and legitimacy under all circumstances.
The adoption of this approach by other states will be an indispensable prerequisite for the development of relations.
In line with international law and legitimacy, deterrent policies will be implemented against countries that pursue hostile policies against Turkey and target our national interests.
Thanks to our policies based on this understanding and principles, problems will be solved,
build and nurture relationships,
involvement as an effective member of the international community in regional cooperation initiatives,
Contributing to peace, stability and prosperity at the regional and global level for the peaceful settlement of disputes will be ensured.
In order to give Turkey's geo-strategic position an eco-strategic dimension, Turkey's position as a global bridge and corridor in the fields of air, sea and land transportation and communication on the East-West and North-South axes, as well as an energy bridge and terminal in the transportation of Central Asian and Caspian Basin energy resources to foreign markets will be transformed into a strategic advantage.
b) "Regional Leader" Turkey, the Guarantor of Peace and Stability
Efforts will be made to resolve regional problems and ensure peace, security and stability
The security, prosperity and stability of the region surrounding Turkey are of vital importance for our national interests.
Establishing peace and stability in our region,
strengthening our relations with the countries of the region in all areas,
the independence and territorial integrity of these countries,
Increasing the level of economic and social prosperity
and providing all kinds of support for the advancement of democratization processes are our priority foreign policy goals for the region.
Turkey will take the lead in solving the problems that threaten peace and security in the Caucasus-Balkans-Middle East triangle.
Recently, Iraq and
The conflicts and political developments in Syria are a source of serious concern for Turkey.
Our Iraq policy will be guided by the protection of Iraq's territorial integrity, the
protection of the legitimate rights and security of the Turkmen presence in Iraq
and Iraq will be guided by the absence of a security threat for Turkey in the Iraqi plains.
In the face of terrorist threats and attacks against our country from Iraqi territory, Turkey will exercise all its rights arising from international law and eliminate all threats.
The civil war in Syria, our southern neighbor, which has been raging since 20 11, must be brought to an end with a lasting reconciliation.
Under the MHP, "regional power Turkey" will do its part to preserve Syria's territorial integrity and ensure peace and stability,
It will contribute to the democratization and development process as well as the restoration of prosperity and stability in Syria after the end of the civil war.
Formations originating from Syria that threaten Turkey's stability and the security of life and property of our citizens will be prevented.
Our party considers it necessary for Turkey to extend a helping hand to all people in Iraq and Syria who are subjected to the atrocities of war, regardless of their identity or nationality.
The healthy return of Iraqi and Syrian refugees to their homeland will form the basis of our policy on this issue.
However, given the international nature of the problem of asylum seekers and refugees, the solution to be provided must also be international.
In this sense, our government will use all diplomatic means to ensure that the United Nations and our allies share the financial burden of asylum seekers while they are our guests in Turkey.
Our relations with Egypt will be gradually normalized.
Iran, with which we have long-standing relations, is another important neighbor for Turkey.
Believing that the situation in which Iran finds itself due to its nuclear activities is unsustainable and that an approach focused on nuclear capacity for peaceful and humanitarian purposes is acceptable for every country, our Party wishes to continue our relations with Iran in a friendly neighborhood, close dialogue and cooperation.
A just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian conflict through peaceful means and the recognition of Palestine as an independent state and its inclusion in the community of nations will be pursued.
c) "Global Power" Turkey, Defender of International Peace and Justice
An effective foreign policy that emphasizes international cooperation will be pursued
MHP international terrorism,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
human trafficking
armament
global warming
solving global challenges such as illegal migration
and to offer Turkey's concrete support for the achievement of global peace and justice.
In its foreign policy, the MHP attaches special importance to international cooperation and coordination to solve transnational problems such as the fight against terrorism.
In line with the MHP's "Global Power Turkey" goal, Turkey will become a country that contributes to universal peace by drawing strength from the social, political and economic successes to be achieved in our country.
We believe that international organizations, particularly the UN, should be more effective, transparent, democratic and consensual, with a fairer representation of all countries.
We believe that many developments that undermine international peace and stability are closely related to the current structures of these institutions, which do not serve this understanding and require urgent reform. With this understanding, we envisage close cooperation with the international community to facilitate the establishment of peace and security in our government.
Through its exemplary conduct on regional and global issues and in bilateral and multilateral relations, the MHP will make Turkey one of the countries that contribute significantly to world peace
, and will restore to our state and nation the prestige it deserves.
d) Relations with the Turkic World
The Turkic world will be a privileged area of interest for our foreign policy
Turkey will strive for the protection of the rights and laws of all our compatriots and citizens wherever they are in the world.
Our relations with Cyprus, the Caucasus, the Balkan countries and the Central Asian Turkic Republics will be developed and deepened in every field.
Our Party prioritizes the developments in the Middle East based on the security, peace and prosperity of the Turkmen entity.
Comprehensive political and economic cooperation projects will be implemented to maintain and enhance peace, security and stability in this region.
In line with international law and the principles guiding inter-state relations, close attention will be paid to cognate and kin communities outside Turkey and necessary institutional cooperation structures will be established with priority.
Our main goal is to develop our relations with the Caucasus and the Central Asian Turkic world on the basis of sovereign equality, common interest and mutual benefit in all areas and to give them a strategic dimension.
To this end, a comprehensive political-economic cooperation program will be prepared and concrete initiatives will be taken to transform it into a joint action plan in consultation with the relevant countries.
In this context, the formation of the "General Council of the Turkic World" will be pioneered to institutionalize joint work in these areas.
In the energy sector as well as in other sectors, close cooperation with the Independent Turkic Republics and Turkic communities will be ensured, national energy agencies and a "Turkic World Energy Council" will be established between our countries.
The "Center for Scientific and Technological Cooperation of the Turkic World" will be supported in all aspects and its effective functioning will be ensured.
Thus, our relations with the Turkic world will be developed in the field of science and technology, and the "Turkic World Science and Technology Database" will be established. will be formed.
In addition, a "Ministry of the Turkic World" will be established under which institutions related to the coordination of relations with the Turkic world and Turks living abroad will be established.
e) Cyprus
The rights of the Turkish Cypriot community will not be waived under the name of a political solution
Cyprus is Turkey's most important national cause.
Turkey has inalienable and non-negotiable treaty rights and obligations over Cyprus stemming from the founding treaties.
Under no circumstances will Turkey's effective and de facto guarantee be eroded or negatively affected in the context of a political solution.
Turkey will continue to support the honorable struggle that our compatriots living in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus have been waging for many years with great perseverance and sacrifice under all circumstances.
Turkey will not stand by any approach that threatens the existence of its Cypriot compatriots.
Our Party believes that the only realistic, viable and viable solution in Cyprus must be based on a bi-zonal, bi-national and bi-state partnership.
Since it has become clear that our unilateral goodwill is not sufficient for such a solution, it is our expectation that both the Greek Cypriot administration and the EU will now approach this issue in good faith and in a constructive manner.
Our Party, which believes that the European Union's stance in favor of the Greek Cypriot side is an important factor in the Greek Cypriot side's intransigent attitude, will continue to defend the interests of the Turkish Cypriot people to the end in the negotiation process to be carried out with the EU, and will oppose the assertion of Cyprus as a precondition for EU membership, regardless of the cost.
f) European Union
The EU will not be seen as a matter of fate for Turkey
Our relations with the European Union have been derailed today due to the insincere attitude of the EU, primarily stemming from the Cyprus problem.
There is a view among some leading EU officials and European politicians that the current negotiation process with the EU cannot lead to Turkey's full membership.
Such a result is unacceptable for Turkey.
Our Party does not see relations with the EU as a "question of identity and destiny" for Turkey.
Turkey is not doomed and in need of being dragged into the orbit of the EU at any cost.
Our policy will be based on the continuation of accession negotiations, provided that the EU's approach to key foreign policy issues such as Turkey's national unity and integrity, terrorism and separatism, Cyprus, Greece and Armenia does not harm Turkey's interests, and the rejection of approaches other than full membership.
On the other hand, necessary initiatives will be taken to eliminate the asymmetric nature of the current Customs Union relationship with the EU and to establish new institutional mechanisms in which Turkey will have a say in trade policy areas of interest to Turkey.
g) United States of America
Our relations with the United States will be based on equality and reciprocity
It will be essential to conduct our relations with the United States on the basis of equality and reciprocity in a manner to serve the mutual interests of both sides in economic, political and security dimensions.
The development and deepening of our bilateral relations will serve the interests of both countries and will have positive repercussions on a global scale.
Our cooperation with the United States on regional and global issues within the framework of NATO and at the bilateral level will be shaped in line with our national interests.
h) Russian Federation
Cooperation between Turkey and Russia will be a decisive factor in solving regional problems
We attach great importance to our relations with Russia, our northern neighbor and an important regional ally within the framework of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
Cooperation between Turkey and Russia will be a decisive factor in solving the age-old problems in the Balkans, the Black Sea and the Caucasus region.
Multilateral policies will be pursued for the development of relations and joint economic projects with Russia and its neighboring countries aimed at peace, stability and regional cooperation.
In this framework, efforts will be made to re-functionalize the BSEC, which has been ineffective in solving regional problems.
Against the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the attempts to exile, exterminate, deny and assimilate the Crimean Turks, the rights and laws of our compatriots will be defended with determination and
efforts will be made to reach a rational and fair solution with Russia.
ı) Rising Powers
New cooperation will be developed with countries of increasing importance in world politics, regardless of geography
MHP aims to closely monitor countries and regions that are becoming increasingly important in world politics and to develop multidimensional and multilateral relations by establishing new cooperation mechanisms.
In this framework, it will take initiatives to develop comprehensive relations with East Asian countries, particularly Japan and China.
Similarly, strengthening our relations with countries such as India, the Republic of South Africa, Brazil and Mexico will be an important item of our foreign policy.
Diplomatic, political, economic, commercial, social and cultural relations with all African countries, especially with North African countries with which we have historical and cultural ties, will be developed and deepened.
These relations will be a concrete demonstration of our Party's vision of establishing reliable friendships on all continents and its understanding of pursuing a multidimensional foreign policy, which aims to make Turkey a global power in the long term.
30- PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
The public will be accurately informed on all issues and at all times
In Turkey, where all kinds of information pollution and information abuse are easily possible and information security is violated, we see it as a requirement of our principled, honest and ethical political understanding to enlighten the public and provide them with accurate information.
In every issue, accurate information will be conveyed to our citizens without trying to manipulate and exploit public opinion, leaving the understanding of events to the nation's own discretion.
Legal and technological measures to ensure information security will be implemented rapidly.
Restrictions on citizens' right to receive accurate information will be removed
As a requirement of our understanding of clean, principled and transparent politics, the "right to information" of our citizens will be fulfilled in a healthy manner and in this way, the ground will be prepared for citizens to make the right choices.
All obstacles that restrict people's right to receive accurate information through perceptions will be removed, and a climate that will enable people to become free individuals who can think freely and make healthy decisions will be created.
A strong and healthy public relations system will be established
In order to announce the views, thoughts and activities of our Party on various issues and to ensure that our nation is informed in a healthy manner by interpreting the events taking place in our country and in the world from a Turkey-centered perspective, importance and priority will be given to face-to-face communication in addition to the use of all accessible and fast means of communication.
In this framework, public information and enlightenment activities will be carried out through effective methods, especially in the fight against terrorism.
It will also be ensured that actions are promoted through healthy communication channels with our citizens.
The outdated understanding that the Prime Minister, ministers and public officials scold citizens, ill-treat them and make ugly remarks will be put an end to, and
an understanding that prioritizes people will form the basis of our public disclosure policy.
Our Party will not allow the abuse of our national and spiritual values with concepts such as democracy, human rights and the supremacy of law as a cover for actions that are not in the best interest of the state and the nation, and in the face of every attempt in this direction, our Party will be the guide of our citizens by sharing accurate information for the peace and prosperity of the nation and the survival of the state and the nation at any time, anywhere and to whomever it is related.
The understanding of information aimed at misleading the public will be eliminated
The information understanding of the media and other means of communication, which, while they are supposed to monitor the government on behalf of the public, set false deadlines, create pressure and mislead the public by setting aside independence, impartiality and ethical principles, will be eliminated with all its elements.
In this context, measures and regulations will be taken and arrangements will be made to ensure that the media and civil society organizations fulfill their duties of informing the public correctly and monitoring the government on behalf of the public in a healthy manner.
In addition to the functions of supervisory institutions, the proper functioning of public oversight and self-regulation mechanisms will be ensured.
In Turkish political life, the Nationalist Movement Party, which conducts politics within the framework of the principle of "My Country and My Nation First, My Party Second" and with an understanding of the culture of democratic responsibility, will realize the construction of "Leader Turkey" with the support it receives from the nation.
The Nationalist Movement Party will continue to be the guarantee of the survival of Turkey and the Turkish nation in the future, as it has been since the day it appeared on the Turkish political scene.
Just as our Party, with its presence on the political scene, has contributed to raising democratic standards and establishing a culture of consensus in the past, it will be the guarantor of the dignity of the political institution, democratic principles and the supremacy of law in the future.
Our goal is to perceive and interpret the age in Turkish with a vision that is aware of the dynamics of Turkey and the world,
glorifying the nation
and to build the "Global Power Turkey" of the future with the ideal of making the state eternal.
The realization of this ideal will be possible through the establishment of national unity and solidarity, and the establishment of national unity and solidarity will be possible through an understanding of "nation" based on common values and past, and a common march towards the future.
The Turkish nation is a nation that lives and carries the legacy of the Turkish-Islamic tradition and a glorious civilization from generation to generation, bringing them together in the crucible of history and culture; Turkey is the name of the land that harbors this legacy.
The ability of the Turkish nation to move towards a common future will be directly proportional to the highlighting of the rich common values among the members of the nation.
What Turkey needs most today is the unification of a nation that has been divided and the re-establishment of a national consensus and national excitement that will ensure a common march for the construction of a strong Turkey by re-establishing the damaged law of card parity.
The basic dynamics of reconciliation between all social segments and actors in Turkey under our rule are national and spiritual values,
contemporary democratic principles,
supremacy of law
and rules, institutions and "management style" based on human rights.
The vision of "Global Power Turkey", which can be achieved and sustained with a common determination, is the expression of an understanding that is rooted in the historical and cultural realities of the Turkish nation and embraces the future, and the long-term strategic goal of the Nationalist Movement, which considers establishing a new civilization and a new world centered on Turkey as its political mission.
This mission will make Turkey a global power and a leading country,
necessary will for all oppressed nations to live in freedom and dignity.
The Nationalist Movement Party is the only political force that can ensure this determination.
The main dynamic that creates this power is the democratization of the political system,
representation of social values at the political center,
the promotion of a culture of card parity and solidarity,
reconciliation
and our understanding of "Turkish Nationalism", which is based on absolute trust in our nation and whose spiritual foundations are the principle of "live and let live".
We believe that the Turkish nation has the historical experience and cultural depth,
It has the possibility and potential to create a great new synthesis by incorporating democratic universal gains.
It is at peace with its national and historical values,
with the ability to solve problems,
developed and established an efficient state order
and a strong Turkey that has achieved a respected position in the community of nations will have a say in world politics and economic life in the 21st century.
In such a Turkey, no development in its immediate or distant neighborhood will be able to threaten Turkey's security and peace of mind, nor will it be able to ignore Turkey's rights.
Since the establishment of regional peace and security will be directly related to Turkey's national interests, no global or regional actor will be able to threaten peace and security despite Turkey.
The Turkey-centered civilization project aims to raise democratic standards in the world,
to increase reimbursement,
guaranteeing human rights and freedoms,
for justice to prevail,
peace and tranquility,
the elimination of conflicts and tensions,
the eradication of poverty,
It will ensure that all humanity enjoys the virtues of living humanely.
The march of civilization to be initiated by the Turkish nation will find its spiritual roots in Turkish-Islamic sources, build its cultural foundations on our ancient religions, and draw the energy it needs from the Turkish nation's aspirations to grow, progress, leap over the ages and bring justice to the world.
This march will first and foremost make Turkey confident,
standing on its own power,
head held high, belly full
and to make it an honorable country where free individuals live.
It is a human-centered march that seeks to humanize the phenomenon of globalization and make it just.
In a Turkey that has achieved the above-mentioned goals, political, social and economic stability will have been achieved,
chronic problems will have been solved,
common national and spiritual values will have been united, the
political, social and cultural foundations of national unity will have been strengthened, a
national consciousness will have been formed in the integrative framework of rich common values
, and the millennia-old law of brotherhood will have been glorified.
Turkey will be a global power, a decisive force in the political, economic and diplomatic spheres;
armed forces will become one of the three most powerful and deterrent armies in the world;
will be at the top in terms of the level of human development.
It will contribute to science, technology and developments for the benefit of humanity.
High-tech "Made in Turkey" branded products will be available everywhere in the world and these will be the most preferred products.
Countries that are willing to embrace the universal and humanitarian principles and values that "Global Power Turkey" has made dominant in state and human life, and that desire to be under the umbrella of peace opened by Turkey, will gain strength from this unity and at the same time add strength to this structure.
With a population exceeding 100 million in 2053, employment reaching 50 million, exports reaching 3.2 trillion dollars, Gross Domestic Product reaching 10 trillion dollars and per capita income reaching 100 thousand dollars, Turkey and the Turkish nation will be able to end centuries of exploitation of oppressed nations.
and will open a new "Age" 600 years after the conquest of Istanbul, with the construction of a civilization that will bring an end to the order of tyranny in the name of democracy, human rights and justice.
The Nationalist Movement's long-term vision for Turkey is to achieve a single power;
The "Election Declaration", which aims to establish "Social Repair and a Peaceful Future", is being presented to the common sense of the Turkish nation.
We believe and trust that the Nationalist Movement Party will come to power alone in the Parliamentary General Elections to be held on June 7, 20 15, with the permission of Allah Almighty and with the kindness of our nation, and will assume the governance of the country to serve the Turkish nation.
