Today's anxiety and fear of tomorrow make our lives unbearable.
The absolute power of the state and capital is turning our lives upside down, objectifying society and nature.
It does not recognize, take into account, ignore or suppress our existence, our identity, our desires, our needs.
While encircling the absolute supremacy of political power with security circles, it renders nature, people and society precarious.
It wants to establish unhindered control over all of our living spaces, while shielding the market and political power with immunity.
HDP is fighting for radical democracy.
This understanding of democracy aims to enable the people to become an organized power over their own lives.
It sees the empowerment of society as the basis for equality, freedom and equal citizenship.
It aims to give society a say and decision over production and working conditions.
Democracy cannot be achieved by those who cannot produce resistance against the oppression of society and human beings under the absolute domination of capital and political power.
We need real democracy to build a new life in which the conditions of existence and life of every element of society are guaranteed by society as a whole.
-The empowerment of society is the empowerment of the oppressed, ignored and ignored sections of that society.
-It is the right of workers and laborers to ensure occupational safety against workplace murders.
-It is the right of all peoples to realize their own identity and culture in their mother tongue within the framework of democratic autonomy.
-Increasing the support of women in the struggle against male domination and violence.
-The liberation of youth from fear of the present and the future. -That
unemployment and
poverty are not sustainable but ended.
-Understanding that our identities are not a threat to each other.
It is the realization that the job of the state is not to impose identity on us.
- It is a common recognition that nature is not a raw material but life itself.
- It is the worker's right to strike,
is to make visible the invisible labor of women.
-It's an Alevi cemevi,
free education
and health;
qualified, public, secular, secular, scientific, mother tongue education.
-Transportation under conditions that do not harm human dignity,
is the right to housing.
Strengthening the foundation of society is only possible by building an economy of trust.
Ensuring that the individual feels secured by society is the basis of a trust economy.
We are on the eve of the days when there is no worry about today and no fear of tomorrow.
We call on the peoples of Turkey to meet and unite in the ranks of the HDP, to grow the HDP on the road to building the "New Life" together.

Let's imagine a Turkey for women.
Let us dream, because we can make our dreams come true.
As women, we are half the world.
We will fight together and build the new life we dream of together.
We can cry out that our body, our identity, our labor is ours;
Where we can freely express our thoughts and beliefs;
Where we can decide our own headscarves and skirt lengths;
Where we can study at the school of our choice;
That we choose the profession we want;
Equal pay for equal work;
That we get the wages and social support we deserve;
In all areas of life, in politics, where we can exist as we want, whenever we want;
Where we can choose the living space we want without leaving our home, our village;
Education in our mother tongue;
Without war and violence;
Where we do not experience violence, where violence against women is considered a serious crime and severely punished even before it occurs, at the stage of threatening and attempting physical violence;
Courts that prosecute perpetrators of violence without discounts or discrimination;
Where we are not harassed anywhere, where we can walk freely on the streets;
That we are not killed by male and state violence;
We do not wash all the dirty laundry, all the dirty dishes of the world;
That we don't have to feed the whole world with our own labor;
In communal living spaces, domestic work, child, elderly and sick care are shared;
Where we decide whether to have children, how many children we have, how we give birth;
Where children run around in lush green parks, where there are free kindergartens in every neighborhood where they can stay safely;
That half of the Parliament is women, that women MPs represent women's struggle;
We dream of a Turkey, a new life where we are not subject to any domination, especially male domination.
As women, we will break all dams, the electoral dam and the male dam, and we will weave a new life.

The youth's rebellion, new political language, democratic political culture and libertarian attitude have the potential to make our new politics of life a real alternative to national politics and to organize a new life.
In the face of the power mechanisms that try to have decision-making and control over the lives of young people, against the policies that adults speak on behalf of young people, think and design for them, our party will raise the desire of young people for emancipation everywhere and fight for them to become equal and free citizens.
